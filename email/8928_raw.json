I feel that a first time poster ought be\ngiven a little more leeway before being picked apart on distraction issues.\nIf a mailing list is only for those with total intimate knowledge of the\nproduct/terminology/concepts, then I find that a closed list. As I tried\nsaying with humour, forget logic steps -- try to discuss my point, if might\nbe right. Forget logic steps, I was trying to says &quot;if suites are the\ninternal representation of testcase collections, with hierarchy, then help\nthe user mange them&quot;.\n\nThat said, maybe my approach/point was too contentious off the bat, and got\nwhat it (unintentionally) deserved.\n\nPerhaps I should have said:\n\n    &quot;If suites are testcase hierarchy, then I don&#39;t think it is the users\njob to manage them&quot;.\n\nor better yet:\n\n    &quot;If we accept that suites can represent dependency, then I don&#39;t think\nit is the users job  to manage them&quot;.\n\nJust because I used my word not yours, doesn&#39;t mean my point was absurd.\nAlso, this is hardly a logical conclusion. I was attempting to establish\ncommon ground to communicate, and then make a point.\n\nI think this highlights much of the problem I&#39;ve had communicating with\nfolks on this list. I think it is the &quot;list experts&quot; job to attempt to\nunderstand the well intentioned ramblings of the newbies, not rip them\napart...\n\nAll in all, I need to find a way to communicate better. Clearly, what I\nwrite is not what you read. However, I wish we could have spent the time\nwhittling through that rather than side issues...\n\nregards,\n\nAdam\n\n   &gt;each time) but this is the crux of my argument: If (big IF) suites are\n  &gt;testcase dependencies,\n\n  They absolutely, positively are NOT. I cannot stress this enough. A\nTestSuite is an arbitrary collection of Test objects, and nothing more.\n\n  &gt;then I don&#39;t think it ought be the user&#39;s job to\n  &gt;manage them -- I think the framework should.\n\n  Since your hypothesis is wrong, your conclusion is not meaningful. :)\n(That&#39;s logic&#39;s fault, not mine.)\n\n  &gt; It is easy for me (outside the\n  &gt;code) to say this, but I think they were a useful construct before, but\n  &gt;they\n  &gt;may have outlived their usefulness. I posit that suites are the existing\n  &gt;hammer, so they are making things seem like a nail.\n\n  I don&#39;t understand this statement at all. A TestSuite is just a composite\ncollection of tests. What else do you propose to use?\n\n  &gt;    &gt;My examples were just simple ones. Dependency can be in the eye of\nthe\n  &gt;    &gt;beholder... :-)\n  &gt;\n  &gt;    I don&#39;t know that it can be: dependency is or is not.\n  &gt;\n  &gt;I was saying dependency due to aggregation, you were saying dependency\ndue\n  &gt;to feature. I was agreeing that users could set dependency for whatever\n  &gt;reason they chose.\n\n  I see, yes.\n\n  &lt;snip /&gt;\n  &gt;\n  &gt;      Maybe I misunderstand Test Collectors -- point me to something to\n  &gt;learn more, if you don&#39;t mind\n  &gt;     -- but don&#39;t they just       create TestSuite objects?\n  &gt;\n  &gt;Unfortunately I don&#39;t have that information, I know they scan classpaths\n  &gt;and\n  &gt;match class patterns (e.g. *Test*). I assume they build a testsuite (or\n  &gt;collection of such) but I don&#39;t know, sorry. Taking a brief look at some\n  &gt;ant\n  &gt;code they may even use an array/enumeration of testcases & their own\n  &gt;runner,\n  &gt;but I can&#39;t be sure.\n\n  The bottom line is that the mechanism is essentially the same as a\nTestSuite, and a TestSuite is just a collection!\n\n  &gt;      Your way to declare a test suite is already supported by JUnit and\na\n  &gt;little    cute refactoring.\n  &gt;\n  &gt;      Consider the AllTests pattern. I can reduce it to a collection of\n  &gt;AllTests or  TestCase class names with a little neat refactoring. Then I\n  &gt;can\n  &gt;use that little engine to store AllTests as text. The next step is to\n  &gt;generate that text by doing a directory scan. Now I have a TestSuite\n  &gt;builder\n  &gt;that build tests from a part of the file system.\n  &gt;\n  &gt;      I did nothing to change JUnit. I just decorated it. Does it belong\nin\n  &gt;the framework? I don&#39;t think so. That&#39;s a question of taste, in my\nopinion.\n  &gt;\n  &gt;Great explanation of your position, and good summary of the crux of this\n  &gt;discussion as it stands. My views to follow.\n  &gt;\n  &gt;So I think we understand each other quite well -- I just don&#39;t understand\n  &gt;why you think this feature you suggest should be part of the framework?\nWhy\n  &gt;isn&#39;t it a candidate for JUnit-addons or something like that?\n  &gt;\n  &gt;A few responses:\n  &gt;\n  &gt;1) Perhaps set the clock back. What say the original implementation had\n  &gt;test\n  &gt;case dependency, not test suites. Who is to say that suites warrant\n  &gt;inclusion but dependencies do not? Maybe suites must stay  for backwards\n  &gt;compatibility (although I feel they are declining in usage) but why\n  &gt;oughtn&#39;t\n  &gt;dependency be there?\n\n  If you haven&#39;t already, read Kent Beck&#39;s original paper where he develops\nSUnit. Perhaps some insight from there will help.\n\n  Your underlying hypothesis appears to be this:\n\n  If class A depends on B, then there exist tests T(A) that test A and tests\nT(B) that test B such that T(A) depends on T(B).\n\n  It is on this basis that you want JUnit to manage those dependencies. I\nclaim first that JUnit can&#39;t, and second that JUnit shouldn&#39;t.\n\n  1. JUnit can&#39;t manage the dependencies without human intervention.\n  2. JUnit shouldn&#39;t manage the dependencies because they are not universal.\n\n  I do not view dependencies the way you do. What we have in common, though,\nis that we each need to be able to execute different collections of tests at\ndifferent times. This is why the former is not a part of the framework and\nthe latter is. That is the essence of framework. What you want to build is a\ntool. So build it.\n\n  &gt;2) I think dependency needs to be managed on the testcase, hence be an\n  &gt;optional aspect of that class. I think separating this out into a\nseparate\n  &gt;structure (like suite) is a recipe for rust. ***This is why I think it\n  &gt;needs\n  &gt;to be part of the framework, not an add on.***\n\n  Disagree. I don&#39;t want that feature. I&#39;m sure I&#39;m not alone (Dave?). For\nthat reason, adding it to the framework makes the framework noisy. A\nframework ought to include what&#39;s needed for universal solutions and nothing\nmore. Everything else is a tool.\n\n  &gt;3) Given test collectors (classpath/directory scanners) -- and given\nthings\n  &gt;like Eclipse testcase wizards --- I believe suites are fading out of\n  &gt;consciousness. As such, I think it is less to learn to say &quot;my testcase\n  &gt;depends upon these testcases&quot; than learn a the testsuite concept.\n\n  Get this straight: TEST CASE DEPENDENCY IS EVIL. Test cases should be as\nindependent as possible. It should be possible to select a number of tests\nand just run them. JUnit supports that. You can build your TestSuite however\nyou want. The fact that there aren&#39;t better tools for this surprises me.\n\n  This mailing list has several messages showing people scratching their\nheads over which tests to run instead of just creating a TestSuite with the\ntests they want. It&#39;s like THEY DON&#39;T REALIZE that a TestSuite can contain\nany tests they want -- even if they belong to completely different TestCase\nobjects, and so on. They are in jail: their view is narrowed artificially by\nnot seeing the simplicity of TestSuite: it&#39;s just a collection of tests.\nCollect &#39;em however you want.\n\n  You want to collect &#39;em by test case dependency -- however *YOU* define\nit -- then go write the code to do it. It ain&#39;t that hard. It still doesn&#39;t\nbelong in the framework, because IT IS NOT UNIVERSAL USAGE. It is a narrow\nview of how to put tests together.\n\n  You see Test Collectors as a replacement for TestSuite objects. With\nrespect, that&#39;s absurd, unless the JUnit test runner is not adequate for\ntheir task. Still, why they decide to reinvent the wheel, I can&#39;t imagine.\n\n  &gt;4) I believe (IMHO -- w/ no market research, just based on projects I\nknow)\n  &gt;that dependency has great user benefit than manual test suite. As such,\nI&#39;d\n  &gt;like it in the framework to aid the most users.\n\n  If you need to collect tests based on your notion of dependency, then you\nwould be a complete idiot to continue maintaining test suites manually.\nEventually you should automate that work. Why do you insist on comparing\nautomated tasks to manual ones?\n\n  &gt;Remember that my goal -- Kent&#39;s goal, too -- is to keep JUnit very tight\n  &gt;and\n  &gt;small. It should provide just enough for everyone, rather than a glut of\n  &gt;features that have limited use. The less to learn, the better. If you\nneed\n  &gt;more, grab add-on package X, add-on package Y and add-on package Z.\n  &gt;\n  &gt;I can understand that goal, and I might agree w/ it academically. That\n  &gt;said,\n  &gt;I think product purity comes (a close) second to usability. And even with\n  &gt;that said, I don&#39;t see how your goal counters what I suggested & doesn&#39;t\n  &gt;fit\n  &gt;it.\n\n  Because your need is not my need, so don&#39;t pollute JUnit with things that\nonly some people need. That&#39;s not a framework.\n\n  &gt;      Also, the more magic in the package, the less the users need to\nlearn\n  &gt;to use it. I want them to know what they&#39;re doing.\n  &gt;\n  &gt;My goal is better testing through easier test management, easier test\n  &gt;result\n  &gt;analysis. That said, I don&#39;t see how the approach I am suggesting doesn&#39;t\n  &gt;fit this.\n\n  So build it. I&#39;m sure people will use it. It doesn&#39;t belong in the\nframework.\n\n  &gt;BTW: Long before the end of this mail I&#39;ve started to realize that this\n  &gt;whole e-mail chain is an academic exercise, unlikely to result in change.\n  &gt;JUnit still rocks, and I use it fervently, this was just a random thought\n  &gt;that seemed to feel like an epiphany so I posted it...\n\n  Well, in general, JUnit doesn&#39;t change much. That&#39;s intentional. That&#39;s\nwhy we have projects like JUnit-addons, GSBase and so on.\n\n  You feel a need. If no-one has implemented it, then it&#39;s up to you. Either\nway, it does not have universal appeal, so it does not belong in the\nframework. That&#39;s all. It&#39;s very, very simple.\n\n  Take care. I think we&#39;re done here. :)\n\n\n\n  &gt;\n  &gt;regards,\n  &gt;\n  &gt;Adam\n  &gt;\n  &gt;\n  &gt;\n  &gt;[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n  &gt;\n  &gt;\n  &gt;Yahoo!
