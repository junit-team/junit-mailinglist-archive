Compaq Web Language) which is very\npleasant to work with but seems to be dying.\n\nI found myself writing pages to be testable by marking up interesting bits\nof the page so I could find them. For example, if I included my error\nmessages in &lt;span id=&quot;errorMessage&quot;&gt; I could just write\nfindSpansWithId(&quot;errorMessage&quot;). Of course, I discovered that coding for\ntestability made other things easy, as everything was ready for using\nstylesheets without much extra preparation.\n\nSteve\n\nFrom: &quot;Shane Duan&quot; &lt;sduan@...&gt;\n&gt; I worked in WebMacro before and the lead there (actually the boss) seted\nup\n&gt; an testing environment that can generate the output text of a WebMacro\npage.\n&gt; Then we use a Java-Perl tool to parse the resulting string.  For example,\nif\n&gt; we want to assert title, we just ask for a mach of the regular expression\n&gt; (*&lt;html&gt;*&lt;head&gt;*&lt;title&gt;[Title Text]&lt;/title&gt;*&lt;/head&gt;*&lt;/html&gt;).\n&gt;\n&gt; We ended up (through refactoring) having a customized test case that can\ndo\n&gt; things like assertTitle, assertCheckBoxName, assertCheckBoxSelected.  (Off\n&gt; the thread, what we have built through testing and refactoring was so\n&gt; comprehensive and efficient that I was totoally converted into XP. :)  )\n\n\nYahoo!
