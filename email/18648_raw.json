Is this the\ncase for you?\n\nIf so, what value does your &quot;QA&quot; find from these types of tests?\nAdditionally, if so, might it be a risky idea to run only select tests as\nopposed to the collective suite?\n\nIf not, being new to JUnit, it might be advisable for you to consider\nutilizing JUnit for this purpose. (And, in this case, there is certainly\nplenty of info available on this mailing list and even more in more formal\nprint that would be of great value to you)\n\nJust food for thought.
