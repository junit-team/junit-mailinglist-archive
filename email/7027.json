Rainsberger&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jbr@...\">jbr@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; So said  Lauren Bish  on  2/21/2003 --------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I agree with this 100% provided the word &quot;unit&quot; is removed. My fears:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; * The extra tests make refactoring more difficult, by testing the unit<br/>\n&gt; too deeply<br/>\n&gt; * I didn&#39;t write the extra tests, so I&#39;m not sure I&#39;ll understand them<br/>\n&gt; -- although if we pair, have coding standards and collective code<br/>\n&gt; ownership, then this is less of an issue<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; When I worked at IBM, I had people in QA write bug reports whenever the<br/>\n&gt; internal implementation of my component changed, even if it did not<br/>\n&gt; affect the outward-facing behavior of the component. This happened at<br/>\n&gt; least once per month and annoyed the hell out of me. Why is QA trying<br/>\n&gt; to do my unit testing? My standard question to them: &quot;Does the system<br/>\n&gt; work?&quot; When they replied &quot;yes&quot;, my next question was, &quot;Then what the<br/>\n&gt; hell are you worried about?&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --&quot;You moved such-and-such file...&quot;<br/>\n&gt; --&quot;This XML entry changed...&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To me, that&#39;s not what they should worry about. That just wastes<br/>\n&gt; everyone&#39;s time: their time for worrying about it and my time for<br/>\n&gt; dealing with the non-issue.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; That&#39;s why I don&#39;t like the idea of someone else doing my unit testing.<br/>\n&gt; Any other kind of testing is cool, but not my unit testing. When it<br/>\n&gt; comes to Programmer Tests, only programmers need apply. The rest should<br/>\n&gt; test some other way.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat you describe was a management problem, not a problem with unit testing<br/>\ndone by someone other than the author of the code. I have seen such<br/>\noverzealousness from time to time to - it is one of the reasons why we had a<br/>\ntriage team made up of representatives of different disciplines. Such bug<br/>\nreports are the sign of an inexperienced tester and they need to be<br/>\neducated. If they are testing too deeply then someone needs to make them<br/>\naware of that. I always had people test the API first, and treat the units<br/>\nas black boxes, just at a unit level. Such an approach is a lot more<br/>\nproductive than trying to walk through the code and writing tests for the<br/>\nimplemenation - it is not the proper level of abstraction for the tests; the<br/>\nimplementation often changes, but the interface usually doesn&#39;t or shouldn&#39;t<br/>\n(once it becomes halfway stable) - if the interface is changing then you<br/>\nhave a real problem.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, as I stated in my posts several times, the independent unit testers<br/>\nwere indeed programmers, not QA or testing people - or at least not solely<br/>\njust testing people. They were trained and mentored by people like me who<br/>\nhave experience in both disciplines about how to test properly and how to<br/>\nwrite code properly. Some worked out, some did not, but all learned from it,<br/>\nincluding the people doing the training and mentoring.<br/>\n<br/>\nAgain, there were two factors involved that greatly improved unit testing;<br/>\nindependent eyes creating the tests, and a testing<br/>\nmentality/aptitude/attitude. I do believe there is a lot of value in<br/>\nindependent unit testing.<br/>\n<br/>\nFWIW,<br/>\nLauren<br/>\n<br/>\n=====<br/>\nLooking for an experienced Java/C++ Software Engineer?<br/>\nSee: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://developerdude.mystarband.net/resume.html\">http://developerdude.mystarband.net/resume.html</a> </span></blockquote></div>",
