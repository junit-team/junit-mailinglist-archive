In general it worked fine. However<br/>\n&gt; every<br/>\n&gt; now and then (depending on user actions and what else the machine has<br/>\n&gt; running) we&#39;d run into the problems &quot;Missed notification&quot; and &quot;Early<br/>\n&gt; notification&quot; which are described in thread books such as Paul Hyde&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; &quot;Java<br/>\n&gt; Thread Programming&quot;. Solutions to these &quot;standard&quot; problems are also given<br/>\n&gt; in the thread books so we have now solved the problem.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; What we do not have is a test that tells us that we&#39;ve solved the problem!<br/>\n&gt; We only have tests that generally pass even when the problem is there!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; We would like to write a test that specifically tests our wait()-notify()<br/>\n&gt; constructs for robustness against &quot;Missed notification&quot; and &quot;Early<br/>\n&gt; notification&quot;. Has anybody already though through how best to test this?<br/>\n&gt; Or<br/>\n&gt; does anyone have a reference to an article or web where this test may be<br/>\n&gt; described in a generic way or with an example?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>In my book: &quot;Unit Testing in Java - How Tests Drive the Code&quot;<br/>\n(<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1558608680)\">http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1558608680)</a> I tackle the very problem you describe<br/>\nin chapter 11.
