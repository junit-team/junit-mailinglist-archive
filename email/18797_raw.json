Here&#39;s some other\nthoughts, mostly around the technology for testing.\n\nMany developers like the idea of testing their own code, but just\ndon&#39;t see how they can in their particular situation.  One of the most\ngratifying moments I&#39;ve had as a consultant was being able to go from\nbug report to failing acceptance test to failing unit test to code fix\nto passing unit test to passing acceptance test to check-in to bug\nfixed in about 20-30 minutes while my team-mates watched on a\nprojector.  This kick-started a lot of interest in developer testing,\nand TDD, that hadn&#39;t been there before.  As a matter of fact, my first\nmeeting with the team had actually contained the exchange:\n\n&quot;You can&#39;t test that&quot;\n&quot;If you watch, I&#39;ll show how we could...&quot;\n&quot;No, you can&#39;t&quot;\n&quot;Yes, we can!&quot;\n\nIt took about a month and several dozen bug fixes (client-facing bugs,\nmind you) to get familiar with each other and patch up the design for\ntestability before the above could happen.  This would have been a\nbig, risky investment, if the manager hadn&#39;t bought in to the idea\nbeforehand.  Ironically, for someone familiar with the wider landscape\nof software methodology, some teams are simply too focused on\nincremental results to justify that kind of Big Cleanup Up Front.\nWhat can we do for them?  I&#39;d like to see tools that move us toward a\nworld where if you can easily think it, you can easily write the test.\n What kinds of things can I easily think, but not easily test?\n\n1) &quot;All Objects of a given type that are .equals should return equal\n.hashCodes&quot;  Well, here&#39;s my self-plug.  This statement could be\nhandled by a Theory runner, like Marat and I described at\n\n2) &quot;This package should have the same behavior today that it did when\nwe released version 3.2.&quot;  We&#39;re getting there.  JUnitFactory\n(http://www.junitfactory.com) does a good job of generating JUnit\ntests where none exist.  If you generate tests on version 3.2, you can\nrun them on today&#39;s version, and catch a lot of regressions.  [Full\ndisclosure: I&#39;m a research fellow at Agitar, which produces JUnit\nFactory.  It&#39;s still very cool.]\n\n3) &quot;During debugging, I noticed that thisUser.password was null.  It\nshould have been &#39;myPassword&#39;, instead.&quot;  There are research debuggers\nthat allow statements like this to be built and verified, but we&#39;re\nstill waiting for them to reach the mainstream.\n\n4) &quot;I can&#39;t call my code directly without an packagex.HttpContext and\na packagex.UserSession and a...&quot;  This is possibly the biggest failing\nof library and framework providers today.  The ability to test code\nthat depends on Package X is an important part of Package X&#39;s\nfunctionality, but it far too often is left to the developer of the\npackage&#39;s client programs to create a testing harness, often with a\nlot of work.  Ruby on Rails ships with a built-in testing framework,\nwhich I think has part of the success of the framework itself and its\nintegrators.  Ditto for Eclipse&#39;s plug-in development environment.  In\nmy experience so far, Java web frameworks are way behind in this, but\nI&#39;d be happy to find out that there is a framework that ships with a\nusable test framework.  However, I think we can go even farther\nhere--these frameworks are both better suited to acceptance tests than\nisolated unit tests.\n\nIn the end, I think that if developer testing scores a Major Victory,\nit may end up being a developer-driven victory, more like version\ncontrol or automated builds, rather than a manager-driven victory,\nlike QA (of course an over-simplification).\n\n   David Saff\n\nOn 1/23/07, albsavoia &lt;albsavoia@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; I am still surprised that, as we near the 10th, anniversary of JUnit\n&gt; (later this year) developer/unit testing, despite its obvious benefits\n&gt; and the fact that &quot;it&#39;s the right thing to do&quot;, is still only practiced\n&gt; by a minority of developers in a minority of organizations.  And, by\n&gt; practiced I mean, SERIOUSLY practiced.  I talk with a lot of groups who\n&gt; say they *do* unit testing but have just a handful of test, rarely run,\n&gt; and no consistency, idea of code coverage, etc.\n&gt;\n&gt; I gave talks on JUnit and the developer testing revolution at two\n&gt; JavaOne conferences (2004 and 2006) where I talked about the three\n&gt; possible outcomes for the future of developer/unit testing:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Long-Term Defeat:  Theidea of developer testing was a noble, notable,\n&gt; but ultimately short-lived blipin the history of software development.\n&gt; Almost all developers went back to the old way of thinking: testing\n&gt; isfor QA.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Minor Victory: Developer testing does not disappear, but it remains a\n&gt; nicheactivity.  Practiced only by a devoutminority of test-infected\n&gt; developers.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Major Victory: Developer testing becomes a standardsoftware development\n&gt; practice.  The rule,instead of the exception.  Releasingsoftware without\n&gt; unit/developer testing is as unthinkable as releasing softwarewithout\n&gt; QA.\n&gt;\n&gt; I am rooting, of course, for the major victory, but I am starting to\n&gt; have my doubts, and wondering why progress is so slow.  Below is my\n&gt; analysis of what I believe is happening and I&#39;d be very interested in\n&gt; your opinion.\n&gt;\n&gt; In the past few years, I&#39;ve noticed that some developers are easily\n&gt; &quot;test-infected&quot;, others require longer exposure and some encouragement\n&gt; but eventually &quot;get it&quot; , and one group seems to have a built-in\n&gt; immunity.\n&gt;\n&gt; It&#39;s as if there are 3 basic types of test genes:\n&gt;\n&gt; T1 - Very susceptpible to test infection.  Show them a single JUnit\n&gt; example and they get it immediately - and start using it regularly and\n&gt; with great fervor.  When time pressure hits, they fight hard for enough\n&gt; time to test and would rather quit than produce code without tests.\n&gt; They often have framed pictures of Kent Beck on their desk :-).\n&gt;\n&gt; T2 - Somewhat susceptible to test infection.  Show them how to use\n&gt; JUnit/TDD, give them some encouragement and time to appreciate the\n&gt; benefits and rewards; eventually they will become regular users.  When\n&gt; time pressure hits, however, they often revert to no-test mode without\n&gt; too much kicking and screaming.\n&gt;\n&gt; T3 -  Immune to test infection. There&#39;s no amount of showing and\n&gt; convincing that will get them to practice developer testing on their own\n&gt; with any regularity - if at all.  Many of them would rather quit than\n&gt; have to write tests on a regular basis.\n&gt;\n&gt; I would love to be able to say that these genes are somewhat evenly\n&gt; distributed.  A rough Gaussian distribution.  Something like this:\n&gt;\n&gt; T1: 30%\n&gt; T2: 40%\n&gt; T3: 30%\n&gt;\n&gt; But my experience is that developers with the T3 gene outnumber the\n&gt; combined number of those with T2 and T1 gene.\n&gt;\n&gt; This spells trouble because I have also found that when developers\n&gt; become managers they bring with them their attitudes toward developer\n&gt; testing.  And a T3 manager is not going to provide an environment where\n&gt; the T2 (the ones that require some time and encouragement) can become\n&gt; test infected.   And this might explain why developer testing is still\n&gt; practiced by a minority of developers in a minority of organizations.\n&gt;\n&gt; Feedback?\n&gt;\n&gt; Alberto\n&gt;\n&gt; http://www.junitfactory.com\n&gt; Generate JUnit tests.
