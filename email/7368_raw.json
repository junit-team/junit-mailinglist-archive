I have a simple RMI \nserver providing database service supported by a one-file, non-relational \ndatabase.  Database clients pass their object reference to the server when \nconnecting, and so the server can detect a dead connection by the following \nif-statement and \nrecycles the connection for another client:\n\n       if (clientObject != null && clientObject.equals(null)) { ... }\n\nRight now, I just open a few OS shells (Windows XP) and run the clients to \nconnect to the server, manually close a shell, and check the println \nstatements I placed in the server to see that it is indeed working.  It would \nbe great if a TestCase can simulate that.\n\nThanks in advance.\n\nSam\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\n",
