I would like a checkbox which means a=\r\ndd all those testmethods but\n&gt; commented out initially. This would save my =\r\nusual next action which is\n&gt; to go through manually commenting them out - i=\r\nn some classes, this is\n&gt; a lot of work.\n\nAre you sure JUnit does this? I&#39;d=\r\n suspect your IDE does this.\n\n&gt; 2. I would like to see a checkbox and textf=\r\nield which would allow me\n&gt; to append a suffix to each testmethod. At my pr=\r\nesent stage of using\n&gt; JUnit, I find I start out with the test method given=\r\n me by JUnit\n&gt; automagically,  then I populate the body with my test, then =\r\nI\n&gt; copy/paste the testmethod, add 001 to the end of the first of them,\n&gt; 0=\r\n02 to the end of the second one, and go on to edit the body of the\n&gt; second=\r\n of these testmethods.\n\nWhy not just change the name to whatever the test d=\r\noes, like \ntestFooDoesBar or testFooDoesThrowOnBarArg?\n\nIf you copy your te=\r\nst code, consider moving the duplicated code to \nsetUp().\n\n&gt; 3. It would be=\r\n great if while viewing an existing testcase file, I\n&gt; could bring up some =\r\nJUnit wizard that lets me add more testmethod(s)\n&gt; from the base or, I gues=\r\ns, even some other, class.\n\nMy keyboard is my wizard...\n\nRobert\n\n",
