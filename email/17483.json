Google&#39;s a hotbed of the sort of programmers who like to read <br/>\nand write books about OO theory and language design. But most of the <br/>\nworld is not Google.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are certainly widely promulgated recommendations to use <br/>\ninterfaces. I&#39;m not sure these recommendations are actually accepted by <br/>\nanyone except the people promulgating them, though. In particular, what <br/>\nI see is a lot of relatively smart people quietly blaming themselves for <br/>\nnot understanding the complexity that&#39;s being foisted on them, and <br/>\nthinking they must be stupid for not understanding it. They may use <br/>\ninterfaces when forced to do so by the frameworks, but they don&#39;t like <br/>\nit; and they certainly don&#39;t make it the first choice in their own code.<br/>\n<br/>\nInterfaces have their place, but that place has been vastly overdrawn in <br/>\nthe Java world. Most classes simply do not need more than one <br/>\nimplementation.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n﻿Elliotte Rusty Harold  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:elharo@...\">elharo@...</a><br/>\nJava I/O 2nd Edition Just Published!<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.cafeaulait.org/books/javaio2/\">http://www.cafeaulait.org/books/javaio2/</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0596527500/ref=nosim/cafeaulaitA/\">http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0596527500/ref=nosim/cafeaulaitA/</a></div>",
