Essentially, the model has a<br/>\n&gt; listener infrastructure and if the user changes the value of the class<br/>\n&gt; attribute the appropriate event is supposed to fire.  The typical<br/>\n&gt; setter/getter looks like this:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; class MyBean extends Listenable {<br/>\n&gt;     String value;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;     public String getValue() {<br/>\n&gt;         return value;<br/>\n&gt;     }<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;     public void setValue(String newValue) {<br/>\n&gt;         fireAttributeChangedEvent(&quot;value&quot;, value, newValue);<br/>\n&gt;         value = newValue;<br/>\n&gt;     }<br/>\n&gt; }<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I need to test that the setters fire the appropriate event, and that the<br/>\n&gt; event attribute name is correct.  I want a test harness to essentially<br/>\n&gt; collect all the setters and getters and change the value to ensure that<br/>\n&gt; the event is sent as expected.  Then I want to run that against all my<br/>\n&gt; domain models.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; My understanding is that I need to generate a suite, and add the test<br/>\n&gt; instances to that suite.  I&#39;ve upgraded to JUnit 4 because I think it is<br/>\n&gt; designed better.  I&#39;m just at a loss as to how to start.  With JUnit 4,<br/>\n&gt; individual tests are marked with an annotation.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>",
