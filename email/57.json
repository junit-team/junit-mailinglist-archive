(That DOES sound like a song title, doesn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt;it? :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>By the hair band eXtreme Programming ?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;If you can only test your class by testing the output it generates on a<br/>\n&gt;filesystem, its design could be improved. It should probably take an<br/>\n&gt;OutputStream and write there. You can then compare the contents of the<br/>\n&gt;OutputStream to your expected result.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>As a concrete example I am currently working on a a templated code generator<br/>\nimplemented<br/>\nas a Javadoc DocLet. So I run Javadoc , giving it the classname of the<br/>\ndoclet and the name<br/>\nof the code template, and the doclet takes the supplied class information<br/>\nfrom Javadoc and produces<br/>\nan output file according to the template&#39;s instructions. It is a simple<br/>\nprogram, using the reflection<br/>\nAPI and the doclet API to do most of the work.<br/>\n<br/>\nMost of the 9 classes can be quickly and cleanly unit tested with little<br/>\nwork. But the overall<br/>\ntransformation from Template to generated code also needs to be unit<br/>\ntestable for refactoring<br/>\nand maintainence reasons.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as I can tell, I need a standard &quot;oracular&quot; or dummy doclet<br/>\ninformation provider<br/>\nto act as the source of class information and a standard template to test as<br/>\nwell as<br/>\na piece of transformed output to verify against.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe template and canonical output could be embedded as strings in the<br/>\nprogram itself.<br/>\nBut the transformed text (going out via a PrintWriter class) I believe is<br/>\nonly accessible<br/>\nas a file.Am I wrong ? Can I restructure this so that it is unit testable<br/>\nwriting to and<br/>\nfrom buffers and still manageable as a file output type of tool ?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;It&#39;s all about keeping implementation details out of the public interface.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>A<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;file representation is an implementation detail - a stream is not.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;One of the benefits you reap if you implement your classes that way is that<br/>\n&gt;you can add MD5 checksums, compression, etc without any redesign. If your<br/>\n&gt;class is writing directly to a file, you would have to modify that class to<br/>\n&gt;achieve the same.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;Of course, that&#39;s only a guess - I could be completely off :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I think it is clear from my question above that I lack an understanding of<br/>\nhow<br/>\nthis would be achieved within the Javba I/O library.<br/>\n<br/>\nAwaiting your response with baited breath<br/>\n<br/>\n\tJim JM</div>",
