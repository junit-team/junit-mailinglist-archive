When inVAJava() returns true, the UI\ndoesn&#39;t even give you a choice to use the reloading\nclass loader.  Please make sure that the &quot;Reload\nclasses every run&quot; checkbox is *not* checked and see\nif that makes things run correctly for you.  Again,\nI&#39;ve only peeked at the code but it looks to me like\nunchecking that option is what inVAJava() returning\ntrue forces to be the case.\n\nIf the problem turns out to be the reloading class\nloader, then I suggest you spend a little time\nsearching the Junit FAQ and the group archives because\nthe topic comes up a lot.\n\nRick\n\n--- ok_lilya &lt;lilya.jangirov@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Rick,\n&gt; \n&gt; The reason why I want inVAJava() to return true, is\n&gt; so that\n&gt; JUnit will be able to run tests. (My own tests) When\n&gt; inVAJava() \n&gt; returns false or throws exception, the tests will\n&gt; not run.\n&gt; \n&gt; How do I know this? Well, I tried changing the\n&gt; inVAJava() method to \n&gt; return true and false. \n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks, \n&gt; \n&gt; Lily.\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In junit@yahoogroups.com, Rick Berman\n&gt; &lt;rick.berman@a...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Throwing a class not found exception, catching it,\n&gt; and\n&gt; &gt; then returning false is correct behavior for the\n&gt; &gt; method inVAJava().  The class isn&#39;t found because\n&gt; you\n&gt; &gt; aren&#39;t running inside of VAJ.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; You still haven&#39;t answered why you *want*\n&gt; inVAJava()\n&gt; &gt; to return true when you aren&#39;t inside the VAJ\n&gt; &gt; environment.  Once we know that, then perhaps we\n&gt; can\n&gt; &gt; get closer to addressing your issue.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Rick\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- ok_lilya &lt;lilya.jangirov@r...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Rick,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I tried leaving out\n&gt; com.ibm.uvm.tools.DebugSupport\n&gt; &gt; &gt; from classpath but \n&gt; &gt; &gt; then what happens, it throws a class not found\n&gt; &gt; &gt; exception and still \n&gt; &gt; &gt; doesn&#39;t return true.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Lily.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ------------------------ Yahoo!
