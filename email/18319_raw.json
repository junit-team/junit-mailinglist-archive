I&#39;d like to create a junit ant task that\n&gt; just runs on my whole codebase, but not all of my classes will have\n&gt; test methods and I&#39;ll get an error for each class that doesn&#39;t (and I\n&gt; don&#39;t want to have to explictily add each class to my build.xml file\n&gt; when I add a test).\n\nIf I were to try to tackle this, I&#39;d be looking at how the ANT JUnit\nrunner is structured.\n\nVery approximately, it is like this:\n\n&lt;junit&gt;\n  &lt;test&gt;\n    &lt;fileset /&gt;\n  &lt;/test&gt;\n&lt;/junit&gt;\n\nThe &lt;junit&gt; task runs all the tests handed to it by one or more &lt;test&gt;\nelements. The &lt;test&gt; elements get their input from one or more nested\n&lt;filesets&gt;.\n\nSo rather than having JUnit /not/ filter out the non-tests, I&#39;d have\nthat logic in either a custom subclass of &lt;test&gt; or a custom &lt;fileset&gt;\n- or maybe even a customer selector within the fileset.\n\nEven if you don&#39;t sprinkle tests throughout your fileset, it&#39;s kinda\nlame that you have to select tests by doing pattern matching on a\n.class or .java filename. It&#39;s also error-prone as I have found out\nway too many times.\n\nI have often wanted to do something similar myself but have never\ngotten around to it. Let us know how it goes.\n\nKevin\n\n",
