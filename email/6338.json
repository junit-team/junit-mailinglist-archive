I have an (signed) applet, that will download some jar <br/>\nfiles over the net and store them on disk. The applet will also <br/>\ncreate its  own classloader, which will be associated with the <br/>\ndirectory where the jar files (including the file containing the test <br/>\ncase) are stored. The last thing the applet will do, is to call a <br/>\nmethod in some predefined class. It is in this class that I am trying <br/>\nto start JUnit, with a call to TestRunner. The problem is that if <br/>\nJUnit starts its own CL - which, if I understand correctly, is a CL <br/>\ndirectly under the System CL - there is no way that JUnit CL will <br/>\nfind the test case class. Is there any way around this?<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers, Jonas</div>",
