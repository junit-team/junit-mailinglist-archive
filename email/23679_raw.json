Ok so I wrote a simple test that shows a JFrame and uses Java Robot to click on it. Works fine run in Eclipse on Mac as an application or JUnit test but fails when run as JUnit plugin test. Frame would show 1 out of 5 or so times. Removing all unneeded plugins resulted in frame always being shown but the click never seems to happen.\n&gt; \n&gt; I also tried Window Licker and the included Calculator test(s) - same thing... runs as a JUnit Test but fails as a JUnit Plugin Test. One time the frame was shown, but nothing happened (so the test failed). The other times, the frame didn&#39;t even show. Tried removing all VM args and unnecessary plugins.\n&gt; \n&gt; Is this related to the args that Eclipse uses to run plugin tests on Mac? Or the core plugins included to run the tests? Or...?\n&gt; \n\nAlas, I&#39;ve never worked on an Eclipse plugin. The closest I&#39;ve come was an RCP app, and at the time (several years ago) I couldn&#39;t find a good way to run through-the-UI tests for that.\n\nDale\n\n--\nDale Emery\nConsultant to software teams and leaders\nhttp://dhemery.com\n\n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n",
