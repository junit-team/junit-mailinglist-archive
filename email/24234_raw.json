Integrated IDE support would be nice of course, but something like\np=\r\narameter to set would help for starters.\n\nI do not use the suites or catego=\r\nries right now but I do have tests that\nare too slow for me to run all the =\r\ntime. I also do not want to maintain\nseparate suite classes but rather pref=\r\ner to just right-click on a package\nin IntelliJ and select &quot;run tests&quot;. And=\r\n repeating that from the menu if I\nso prefer.\n\nI like to group my tests by =\r\nwhat they test and not have many source trees,\nso currently I just temporar=\r\nily disable some tests if they bother me, run\ntests for a chosen package, a=\r\nnd the whole set later.\n\n\nOn 23 January 2013 11:58, Mark Levison &lt;mark@mlev=\r\nison.com&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt; **\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Kevin, Colin and anyone else who is interested=\r\n,\n&gt;\n&gt; Let&#39;s imagine the scenario here. I show up at client site as part of =\r\na two\n&gt; week engagement. During the 3 days of training we discuss Hill&#39;s de=\r\nfinition\n&gt; of a Microtest; SPiFFy; etc. Now they all understand no **good**=\r\n unit test\n&gt; touches the file system, database, network etc. In addition th=\r\ney&#39;ve groked\n&gt; the value of creating only a small object graph for each tes=\r\nt, max 7-8\n&gt; objects.\n&gt;\n&gt; Here comes the hard part, they&#39;ve got legacy code=\r\n. They sincerely want to\n&gt; do good stuff going forward, but their tests tak=\r\ne ~25 minutes to run.\n&gt; Profiling indicates that there are ~35 tests over ~=\r\n20 test classes that are\n&gt; slow. In almost every case slow tests are mixed =\r\nin with fast tests. In\n&gt; addition many of these slow tests could be made fa=\r\nst (and more valuable) if\n&gt; we just made some clever use of fakes. However =\r\nthis changeover will take\n&gt; easily a couple of months of part time effort.\n=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; In the world of NUnit we would just mark these as members of the catego=\r\nry\n&gt; slow. In JUnit we either:\n&gt;\n&gt; - mark them as members of the category s=\r\nlow and resort to @suite\n&gt; annotations\n&gt; - mark them as members of the cate=\r\ngory slow and use maven tricks - helps\n&gt; the build server but not the indiv=\r\nidual developer running eclipse\n&gt; - move the slow tests to a separate sourc=\r\ne tree. Works well when you\n&gt; intentional write slow tests from scratch but=\r\n not so much when you inherit\n&gt; this existing mess.\n&gt;\n&gt; As it stands I can =\r\nwaste alot of time with a client trying to overcome this\n&gt; issue when we sh=\r\nould be practicing TDD, Mikado method, etc.\n&gt;\n&gt; Again my key point for JUni=\r\nt 5 before discussing new things like Lambda&#39;s I\n&gt; think the challenge shou=\r\nld be to make the existing functionality as simple\n&gt; to use as possible.\n&gt;\n=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; Cheers\n&gt; Mark Levison\n&gt; Agile Pain Relief Consulting http://agilepainre=\r\nlief.com/notesfromatooluser\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; | Writing http://agilepainrelief.com/note=\r\nsfromatooluser/&gt;\n&gt; Proud Sponsor of Agile Tour Gatineau Ottawa http://goagi=\r\nletour.ca/&gt; Nov\n&gt; 28, Toronto http://www.torontoagilecommunity.org/display/=\r\nPUBLIC/Home&gt;\n&gt; 26 and Montreal http://agilemontreal.ca/agile-tour-2012/&gt; 24=\r\n\n&gt;\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\n\n[Non-t=\r\next portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n",
