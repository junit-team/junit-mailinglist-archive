The<br/>\n&gt; company I work for has developed this connector to an EIS written in<br/>\n&gt; C/C++. This JCA connector uses the Command design pattern in order to<br/>\n&gt; get/send and validate information on the EIS.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Now they have added two new commands to this connector and I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; supposed to test them. As it&#39;s legacy code, there are no junit tests<br/>\n&gt; and I will be the first one to write them but only for those new<br/>\n&gt; commands. My idea is to test the JCA connector out of the container<br/>\n&gt; and have a mock EIS since testing inside the container and connecting<br/>\n&gt; to the real EIS seems really painfull to me. :) <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; However, I have no clue how to do that cause the code under test does<br/>\n&gt; not offer a way of receiving a mock object. This code instanciates all<br/>\n&gt; it needs within the Command method execute.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Is there any framework that could help me in this challenging<br/>\n&gt; situation? Something like simulating a fake container and EIS. I did<br/>\n&gt; some googling over the internet and also searched over this group but<br/>\n&gt; couldn&#39;t find anything :( Any ideas?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>How do you gain access to the EIS? If it&#39;s through JNDI, then the <br/>\nMockEJB package provides a MockContext (fake JNDI context) where you can <br/>\nbind whatever object you want for each test. I assume your EIS <br/>\nimplements some Java interface, so you can easily fake it or mock it <br/>\naccording to your needs.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck.<br/>\n--<br/>\nJ. B.
