B. Rainsberger&quot; &lt;jbr@d...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; I first check that the sizes are the same before doing a uni-\n&gt; &gt; directional &quot;contains&quot;. That should take care of the situation \nwhere \n&gt; &gt; one collection is larger than the other. But, you bring up \nanother \n&gt; &gt; point. How can I tell how many times an element appears in a \n&gt; &gt; collection, such as a map?\n&gt; \n&gt; Sadly, you can only count them.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; If multiple elements hash to the same \n&gt; &gt; value is there a way to tell that their are multiple elements for \n&gt; &gt; that hashvalue? The size() method will only tell me how many hash \n&gt; &gt; values there are.\n&gt; \n&gt; It shouldn&#39;t. If it does, you&#39;re doing something else wrong. Post \nsample code \n&gt; if you&#39;re unsure. size() answers the number of distinct (according \nto equals\n&gt; ()) keys in the Map.\n&gt; \n&gt; Remember, hashing is only used to get a &quot;good first guess&quot; of where \nan \n&gt; element is located in a collection; other than that, hashing means \nnothing.\n&gt; --\n&gt; J.
