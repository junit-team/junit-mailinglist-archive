Or at least make sure you don&#39;t<br/>\njump blindly into the cesspool that is EJB.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I am coding in an Eclipse environment, from which I called the JUnit <br/>\n&gt; plugin<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This is a good thing.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; for testing my test class which has the method as below:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; \tpublic void testPlain() throws Exception<br/>\n&gt; \t{<br/>\n&gt; \t\tassertEquals(1,1);<br/>\n&gt; \t\tassertEquals(2,1);<br/>\n&gt; \t}<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I always get only the result for last result:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; junit.framework.AssertionFailedError: expected:&lt;2&gt; but was:&lt;1&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Assertions that pass don&#39;t do anything.  You only hear about the ones<br/>\nthat fail: no news is good news.<br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Where as I want to design a test based on the result of first assert <br/>\n&gt; and I cannot devide them in to two test beds as the test has to be <br/>\n&gt; in single setup-TearDown.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Sorry, but I don&#39;t understand this.<br/>\n<br/>\nI suggest that you do some more in depth reading on JUnit, and ideally<br/>\nTest-Driven Development (TDD).  I suggest both my own book (TDD: A<br/>\nPractical Guide) and Johannes Link&#39;s (Unit Testing in Java).  If you<br/>\npursue TDD (which I strongly encourage you to do) you should read Kent<br/>\nBeck&#39;s as well (TDD: By Example).<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; So is there any workaround for this I see lot <br/>\n&gt; of examples using multiple asserts in single test case, but why they <br/>\n&gt; are not succeeding in my case.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>As has been pointing out, it&#39;s working just fine.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ll mention here that I strive to make my test code extremely clean:<br/>\nmy goal is a single assertion per test method.  Best case is to have<br/>\nall fixture code in setUp() and nothign but a single assertion in each<br/>\ntest method.<br/>\n<br/>\nDave</div>",
