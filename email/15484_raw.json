I \nhad =\r\nhoped to use the Cactus plugin to Maven, but the Sun container is \nnot supp=\r\norted in Cactus.  Only Tomcat, JBoss, Orion, Resin, and \nWebLogic container=\r\ns are supported.\n\nThe Cactus website indicates that other containers can be=\r\n used by \nconfiguring Cactus with a generic container.  Does anyone know ho=\r\nw to \nconfigure the generic container to support a Sun server?  \nSpecifical=\r\nly, the Cactus site states:\n\n&quot;The next example shows the use of the generic=\r\n container element for \nstarting/stopping a custom container. You need to d=\r\nefine the two \ntargets mycontainer.start and mycontainer.stop, so that the =\r\ncontainer \nis started up (on port 8080) before the tests are run, and shut =\r\ndown \nafter the tests completed. How these targets are implemented is \nhigh=\r\nly dependant on the container. Most likely you&#39;ll need to copy \nsome files =\r\nand use the &lt;java&gt; task to invoke a container-provided \nJava class that can=\r\n start/stop the container.&quot;\n\nWhich sounds like Greek to me.  Can anyone pro=\r\nvide some hints?  I \nacquired the cookbook, but I think 11.3 skips a few st=\r\neps that I \nneed.  I think I&#39;m stuck at the point where to add one pound of=\r\n \nground beef, I first have to hunt down and slay a cow.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
