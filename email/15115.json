So, framework should provide some way to<br/>\n&gt;&gt;supply test data lazily.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;From other hand if you think of IDE it should be possible to run<br/>\n&gt;&gt;just specific test or only selected test cases. o, it seems that there<br/>\n&gt;&gt;should be some random-acess API, which iteterator just does not provide.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;Also note that one would be interested to know how many test cases<br/>\n&gt;&gt;in the given data provider as well as a readable name for each test.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;    <br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I exchanged a few emails with JB about that, and my take on &quot;data names&quot; is<br/>\n&gt;basically: I don&#39;t see the need.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;If a test method being fed by a data provider fails, it will clearly say<br/>\n&gt;something like &quot;Expected 42 but got 41&quot;. From that point, it&#39;s pretty easy<br/>\n&gt;to trace which data from the data set caused this error and act on it.<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>  That is exacly the case I&#39;m talking about. In more or less complicated <br/>\nexample test data may include number of input parameters and failed <br/>\nexpectation on primitive value (such as numeric os string assertion) is <br/>\ncompletely unrelated to these parameters. Moreover it is quite possible <br/>\nthat you&#39;d have a side effect and test is failing on some other reason <br/>\n(like internally swallowed runtime exception or something similary weird).<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Actually, I would probably not even care about that myself: I would rerun my<br/>\n&gt;tests, put a breakpoint on any assertion thrown and let the IDE show me<br/>\n&gt;exactly where and when the test fails. Whether this test method was fed data<br/>\n&gt;from a DataProvider or from somewhere else is irrelevant to fix the test.<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>  Don&#39;t you think it would be a mistake to tell the users how they <br/>\nshould work? :-)<br/>\n  Besides, if the test failed on build or continuous integratino server <br/>\nyou would have to rerun test locally with your breakpoint, which would <br/>\nbe quite waste of time in my opinion, because you should know that is <br/>\nfailed from the report.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Another quite practical use case for test names is that they can be <br/>\npotentially used to get better understanding what part of the <br/>\nfunctionality is broken. Especially if this feature is used for some <br/>\nintegration-level regression tests that may potentially cover wide range <br/>\nof functionality.<br/>\n<br/>\n  regards,<br/>\n  Eugene<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",
