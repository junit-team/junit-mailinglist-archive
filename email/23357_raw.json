And I did reuse the same\ndirectory location for all my tests.\nI did clean the directory in the @Before-method and in the\n@After-method (Using jakarta FileUtils).\n\nStandard JUnit does not spawn any threads, as far as I know. So the\ntests are run sequentially. Other runners could change this, of\ncourse.\nIf your code spawns threads, that&#39;s a different matter of course.\nAnd from afar I would also suggest to check for files that where not\nproperly closed.\n\nGreetings,\n   Malte\n\n",
