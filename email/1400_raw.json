Robot could drive the GUI.  However, \nI&#39;ve use other robot like products (WinRunner) and found the test \ncases become very hard to maintain.  Problems arrise whenever widgets \non the screen change position.  The Robot is still trying to perform \nmouse clicks and other actions on the old location.  Since GUI are \ngooey (i.e. change shape a lot while being developed), the testing \nscript shouldn&#39;t depend on screen locations.\n\nInstead, I think the best approach is using some tools that access \nthe GUI components directly, no matter where they are placed on the \nscreen.  This can test the functionality of the GUI.  A human will \nstill have to perform &quot;Usability&quot; testing.\n\nI hope to automate the more mundane and time consuming tasks of \ntesting valid and invalid input, and checking the general function of \nthe system.\n\n- Greg\n\n--- In junit@y..., Joseph Vaughan &lt;jvaughan@o...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Greg - Have you (or anyone else) looked at using java.awt.robot for \nGUI\n&gt; automation?\n&gt; \n&gt; I don&#39;t know if its any good or not, but I&#39;ll be at least \nevaluating it for\n&gt; my next project in a month or so.  I&#39;d be curious what others think \nof it.\n&gt; \n&gt; One big hurdle in this kind of testing is timing.  You often have \nto make\n&gt; sure that event A has finished before you invoke event B.  This can \nbe\n&gt; tricky when you are dealing with networked systems and suchwhat.  \nRobot&#39;s\n&gt; waitForIdle() might help with that ... but like I said I haven&#39;t \nreally had\n&gt; a chance to peer too deep. \n&gt; \n&gt; Its described here:\n&gt; http://developer.java.sun.com/developer/TechTips/2000/tt0711.html \n(second\n&gt; article down).\n&gt; \n&gt;  - joe\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; From: Vladimir Bossicard [mailto:vladimir@b...]\n&gt; Sent: Monday, June 04, 2001 12:30 PM\n&gt; To: junit@y...\n&gt; Subject: Re: [junit] Functional Testing with JUnit\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Hi Matt,\n&gt; \n&gt; could you please send me your code?
