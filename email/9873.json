It is optimized for Object Testing <br/>\n(similar to unit testing); however, it is just an assertion/test <br/>\nsuite/test runner tool. Use it whatever way makes you productive.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;snip /&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I guess that this is not unit testing because I&#39;m not testing a<br/>\n&gt; single method&#39;s actions.  <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Don&#39;t Test Methods; Test Behaviors. Somewhere, you have to invoke a <br/>\nsingle method that says &quot;Do XYZ.&quot; Test that method. In so doing, you <br/>\ndiscover that testing that method would be easier if it were decomposed <br/>\nlike so, and this responsibility were pushed over there... much easier. <br/>\nSo much the better: testing has improved your design.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Is it inappropriate to use junit in this way?  Is there a better way?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Serious question: why the #$%# do you care whether it is <br/>\n&quot;inappropriate&quot;? Does it get the job done?<br/>\n<br/>\nIf your question is &quot;Is there a better way?&quot; then that is another <br/>\ndiscussion entirely. I advise you to put all that out of your mind, <br/>\nwrite some tests, refactor, write some tests, refactor... let the pain <br/>\nbe your guide.<br/>\n<br/>\nTake care.<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJ. B.
