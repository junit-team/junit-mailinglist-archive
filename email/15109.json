Is there a good way to catch command-line args when<br/>\n&gt;    running JUnit?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>To configure subsets of tests to run (and not), I&#39;ve used a properties <br/>\nor XML configuration file.  My defaults are to run all the tests, but <br/>\nduring development, I &quot;hijack&quot; the file (setting it writable outside <br/>\nthe source code management system), and turn off the very long running <br/>\ntests.  I control which tests run by inheriting from abstract base <br/>\nclasses I wrote that themselves extend TestCase (in JUnit 3.x).  I <br/>\noverride the constructor, to mark the test method names for classes <br/>\nwhere I&#39;m not running the tests.  (And given the way that Java <br/>\nconstructors work, this makes me put this customization logic in a <br/>\nstatic method called by the constructor.)  It takes a little program <br/>\nlogic to be able to consistently find the properties/configuration <br/>\nfiles in all the different environments in which our JUnit tests run <br/>\n(ant, and several different IDEs); default directory settings are not <br/>\nstandardized.</div>",
