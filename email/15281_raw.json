But don&#39;t make everything protected just because you think\n&gt; som=\r\neone, somewhere might one day want to use it.\n\n\nI was certainly not advocat=\r\ning this, and I don&#39;t believe Kent was either.\n\nMaking *all* methods protec=\r\nted is just as dangerous as invoking YAGNI every\ntime to justify making *no=\r\n* methods protected.\n\nI just have a fundamental dislike for knee-jerk react=\r\nions that drive design\nprinciples, and YAGNI is one of those.\n\nI don&#39;t desi=\r\ngn with one liners, I use my brain and my experience to decide\nin every sin=\r\ngle case if such or such method should be protected.  Sometimes,\nI will ind=\r\need decide that I will probably not need it later, and other\ntimes, I will =\r\nleave the door open for future extensions even though I can&#39;t\nreally see on=\r\ne myself just now.\n\n\nIf the sheer size of\n&gt; the resulting classes doesn&#39;t s=\r\neem reason enough, then consider that you\n&gt; probably haven&#39;t designed the m=\r\nethod correctly for extension in the\n&gt; first place.\n\n\nYou would probably be=\r\n surprised by how well it works in practice.  Many\ntimes, I&#39;ve been able to=\r\n pull off something very simple just because the\nauthor of the code I was u=\r\nsing had the good idea to make that method\nprotected.\n\nAgain, my point to y=\r\nou is simply:  don&#39;t make YAGNI an absolute rule,\nbecause there are no abso=\r\nlute rules in development.\n\n\nMethods provided in advance of an actual use c=\r\nase are\n&gt; unlikely to fit the use cases that do arise.\n\n\nMy experience is j=\r\nust the opposite.\n\n\n&gt;  We can&#39;t all be experts in everything.\n\n\nExactly.  H=\r\nence,  making your methods protected is not always a bad\ndecision.\n\n\n\nAgili=\r\nty accepts that we\n&gt; don&#39;t know everything, we can&#39;t predict the future, we=\r\n don&#39;t get\n&gt; anything right the first time\n\n\nAgain:  all good arguments to =\r\nuse protected more often than not.\n\n--\nC=C3=A9dric\nhttp://testng.org\n\n\n[Non=\r\n-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n",
