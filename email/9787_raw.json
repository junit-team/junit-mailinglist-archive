There&#39;s well documented solutions.  Look it up.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; I had a short discussion with &lt;I forget&gt; at OOPSLA last week about\n&gt; &gt; the recurring questions of &quot;how would I evolve &lt;insert well known\n&gt; &gt; algorithm here&gt; using TDD&quot;.  Well.. you don&#39;t have to... it&#39;s well\n&gt; &gt; known.. just use it.  Write a few tests to make sure you have it \n&gt; &gt; typed in correctly and that it keeps working.. but I see no reason\n&gt; &gt; to evolve algorithms I learned in University from a text.\n&gt; \n&gt; Might be good exercise, though.\n\nPossibly.  But very artificial.  The point is will I try to test-drive\na search or sort algorithm?  Not likely... I&#39;ll use one with a\ncomplexity/efficiency to match the expected use (simplest thing that\ncould work).\n\nI&#39;ve never found artificial problems to be overly enlightening.\n\nTest-driving card games is fun... start with a simple one like War,\nand move up.\n\nDave\n\n\n",
