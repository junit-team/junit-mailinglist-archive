Now, I&#39;ve done this\n&gt; &gt; a\n&gt; &gt; bunch of times and JUnit is there to select as a library. The first time\n&gt; &gt; you\n&gt; &gt; do this, you may have to pick &quot;Add...&quot; and then click on the &quot;New...&quot;,\n&gt; &gt; fill\n&gt; &gt; out the form and click on the &quot;Add&quot; button to select the junit.jar file\n&gt; &gt; for\n&gt; &gt; the library path.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; I don&#39;t think you have to create a project for JUnit just so that you can add it as a library.  That&#39;ll be kind of weird.\n\nSorry, I guess I wasn&#39;t clear about what I do. Let me try to clarify...\n\nWhen I have an application that I&#39;m going to be testing, I create two\nprojects\nthat are in parallel directories. One holds the original program and the\nother\ndirectory holds the test classes that I develop to test the program.\nThat\nsecond project makes use of JUnit and will have classes that are\nsubclasses of\nTestCase and therefore will depend on the JUnit library. I usually use\nthe\nsame package for both projects (the app and the test app).\n\nAs a result, in the test project, I specify JUnit as a required library\nso\nthat it will build. That was what I was trying to explain in my post.\n\nI use two parallel directories and that ends up with duplicates of the\nclass\nfiles (the test project will build the test sources and the program\nsources).\nI guess you could put the test files in the same tree as the program\nfiles,\nhowever, with JBuilder, I haven&#39;t figured out how to get it to place the\ntest\nclass files in a different place (to separate test classes from app\nclasses).\n\nI&#39;d be interested in hearing about other ways to do this...\n\n\n&gt; \n&gt; And also you can specify the source code jar file, which is bundled in the download, for JUnit in the library, then you can browse the source\n&gt; code of JUnit classes without extracting the files.  Personally I like this feature a lot.\n\nCool! I hadn&#39;t tried that. I would run JAR and extract the sources to a\ndirectory\nand then browse the files. This sounds much easier.\n\n\nPCM (Paul Michali)\n\nCarrier Voice Gateway Business Unit (CVGBU)\nCisco Systems, Inc.\n250 Apollo Drive\nChelmsford, MA 01824\n\nPhone : (800) 572-6771 x 45817  (978) 244-5817 [direct]\nPaging: (800) 365-4578 [voice]  pcm@...
