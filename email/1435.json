Comments?]<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yes, tests that occur in the middle of a use case are tedious to <br/>\nsetup and brittle during refactorings.<br/>\nSometimes they are useful for debugging a certain situation, but may <br/>\nnot be worth their weight to carry forward.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith regards to testing use cases, consider writing a <br/>\nsimple &quot;structured-english&quot; scripting language to express your tests. <br/>\nThe benefit of this approach is that these tests can be understood <br/>\nand written by the business analysts and thus reduce the cost of <br/>\ndevelopment and errors when translating them to Java.<br/>\n<br/>\nhere is a simple script:<br/>\n<br/>\n[TestPurchaseOrder.esl]<br/>\n<br/>\n%include loadCustomers.esl<br/>\n%include loadProducts.esl<br/>\n%include loadEmployees.esl<br/>\n<br/>\ncreate PurchaseOrder P1<br/>\n   date = TODAY<br/>\n   customer = [ Customer with id = 101 ]<br/>\n   salesperson = [ Salesperson with name = &quot;John Honest&quot; ]<br/>\n   addItem [ Part with partNumber = &quot;103QAS23&quot;<br/>\n                price = $50.00<br/>\n                qty = 100 ]<br/>\n   addItem [ Part with partNumber = &quot;103WQ3&quot; <br/>\n               price = $40.00<br/>\n                qty = 10 ]<br/>\n<br/>\nassert P1<br/>\n   date = TODAY<br/>\n   totalCost = $5400.00<br/>\n   totalWeight &lt; 1000lb<br/>\n<br/>\nassert P1<br/>\n   hasItem Part with partNumber = &quot;103QAS23&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; A question for the list:  How do you organize your tests, <br/>\n </span></blockquote>particularly<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; if you write tests that are of both the functional scenario and <br/>\n </span></blockquote>single<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; object unit test varieties?  The common approach seems to be to <br/>\n </span></blockquote>gather<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; all the tests for a given class in one test class.  What about the<br/>\n&gt; scenario type of tests?  Organized by use case?  What communicates<br/>\n&gt; better, especially if we want to use the tests as documentation?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Usually I organize functional tests by subsystem/useCase.<br/>\n<br/>\nRegards,<br/>\n<br/>\nDavid</div>",
