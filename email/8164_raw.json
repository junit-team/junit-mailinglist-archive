Getting in the habit of creating our own\n&gt; suite, can lead to order dependancies since you&#39;re setting the test\n&gt; order explicitly.\n&gt; \n&gt; Dave\n\nFor a simple case like he was writing (to which I was referring), you\ndon&#39;t need it.  True.  However, on larger projects I think the having\nTestSuites is very essential.  For instance, on my current gig we have\nwritten over 1900 test fixtures.  They include typical unit tests,\nfunctional tests, and integration tests.  All of the tests further break\ndown via sub-systems, the type of functionality, etc.  All of these tests\nare run before code is checked in (and often at other times), but there\nare plenty of times when I am only interested in running a subset of\ntests (one or two suites).  It provides quicker feedback since the suite\nincluding all tests takes approx. 300 seconds to run (which is much\nbetter than the 800 seconds it used to take :).\n\nTake care.\n\n--\n=jason\n[:question | ^One]\n\n",
