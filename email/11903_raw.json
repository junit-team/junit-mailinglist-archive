As J.B Rainsberger stated, your Experiment tests do not\ncare much about creating a project - they just want one.\n\nThe same is true then for most of our Project tests as well.  You can\none (or a few) test to make sure that writing to the DB works - but\nsubsequent tests (that again care little about the creation of a\nProject but rather just want a Project) can use a Project that was not\ndatabase driven.\n\nThere are several advantages to following the above style including \n\n1) Speed of test execution (non-database driven tests are usually\nfaster than database tests),\n\n2) Complexity of test setup (in its current state - each test that\nrequires a Project also requires the database and managing that is\nmore complex then simply using an in-memory Project),\n\n3) Increased test de-coupling (if the database goes down, or is\nimproperly configured, then all your Project tests will fail - instead\nof those that more concretely point to a database issue)\n\nTo be fair, there are some disadvantages as well.\n\n1) Fewer tests exercise a real Project (aka database driven) - but we\nare talking about unit tests so in most circles this is expected (you\ncan still use a database driven Project for integration tests)\n\n2) Code refactoring to support DB driven and non-db driven Projects. \nYou could consider Mock-objects, abstracting the persistence layer (to\nnow include an In-Memory as well as database implementation) as well\nas just re-thinking how objects interact with one another (is the\nforeign key constraint an Experiment issue, or a database one?)\n\nandrew f\n\n\n\nOn Fri, 03 Sep 2004 17:27:21 -0500, J.

They are simple codes that writes into the database. The rule is a\n&gt; &gt; Project must be added before a Experiment can be added. This is\n&gt; &gt; because Experiment has a foreign key that points to Project.\n&gt; \n&gt; OK. Project [1]--&gt;[*] Experiment.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; In my ProjectTest I have a testCreateProject test. But in my\n&gt; &gt; ExperimentTest where I have my testCreateExperiment test, I need to\n&gt; &gt; create a project before it will be successful.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Whats the practice for this? Do I put the createProject inside my\n&gt; &gt; testCreateExperiment method? Then I will be actually testing two different\n&gt; &gt; class (Project and Experiment) in a single method\n&gt; &gt; (testCreateExperiment)..\n&gt; \n&gt; I don&#39;t agree with this last statement.\n&gt; \n&gt; In what state does your environment need to be to test creating an\n&gt; experiment? It appears that there must be a project in the database with\n&gt; a known project primary key first. In that case, put one there -- this\n&gt; is what setUp() is for. In TestExperiment.setUp(), then, invoke\n&gt; createProject().\n&gt; \n&gt; Rather than /testing/ createProject(), you are /using/ createProject()\n&gt; -- assuming that it works -- to test createExperiment(). I&#39;m not sure\n&gt; that that&#39;s wise, but that&#39;s another subject, covered in depth in _JUnit\n&gt; Recipes_.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; If anyone is going to suggest control the order of executing the test (i.e.\n&gt; &gt; run ProjectTest before ExperimentTest), note that I need the return value\n&gt; &gt; from testCreateProject in testCreateExperiment.\n&gt; \n&gt; That&#39;s fine -- store that value in a field of TestExperiment and let\n&gt; testCreateExperiment() use that field.\n&gt; --\n&gt; J.
