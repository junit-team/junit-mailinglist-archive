If you are not happy with the version of junit ship=\r\nped with eclipse, just download the version you want (I&#39;d put that into a l=\r\nib-directory in the project as to get is stowed away via svn or csv). Then,=\r\n all you need is to tweak the build-path to point to the downloaded vesion.=\r\n Or you use maven and add it as a dependency.\n\nCheers,\n  Georg\n\n--- In juni=\r\nt@yahoogroups.com, &quot;nuttzy99&quot; &lt;nuttzy@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Point of clarificatio=\r\nn, the PHP Eclipse does ship with enough Java components where I was able t=\r\no write some sample apps with it and run them.\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In junit@yahoogroup=\r\ns.com, &quot;nuttzy99&quot; &lt;nuttzy@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Hey Guys,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I GOT IT!  Be=\r\ntween the two of you, you had the right answer ;-)  In the &quot;Install New Sof=\r\ntware&quot; dialog under Galileo there was nothing there specific to JUnit.  But=\r\n it occurred to me that installing &quot;EPP Java Package&quot; and &quot;Java EE IDE Feat=\r\nure&quot; was a reasonable thing to do.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Did that and now JUnit 4.5 is i=\r\nnstall and I can access the features I previously mentioned were lacking.\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Thanks!\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n",
