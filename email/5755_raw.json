As a developer, I usually have much \n&gt;control ove=\r\nr the\n&gt;way my code is used. It is only the published interface I don&#39;t have=\r\n\n&gt;&quot;full control&quot; over - I would agree that for that (hopefully rather\n&gt;smal=\r\nl interface) your definition of robustness applies.\n\nAgreed. If you send ju=\r\nnk parameters to your internal private methods then nothing I can say is go=\r\ning to help you! ;-)\n\n&gt;&gt; Actually, I&#39;m sure that contingency is addressed b=\r\ny the\n&gt;&gt; automotive industry. Now bringing fire near any body of\n&gt;&gt; petrol =\r\nis bad, but there are ways to reduce the likelihood of\n&gt;&gt; a bad thing. Baff=\r\nles in the tube leading to the petrol tank\n&gt;&gt; are an example of trying to p=\r\nrovide hardware guard conditions.\n&gt;\n&gt;Afaik they don&#39;t guard against putting=\r\n nitroglycerin into the petrol\n&gt;tank... ;)\n\nNo, but they do what they can a=\r\ngainst casual attacks. In the same way that no one can stop a professional =\r\ncar thief from taking any car that they decide to take, yet most of us stil=\r\nl lock our cars. Why? Because it deters most of the casual attempts.\n\n&gt;&gt; Th=\r\ne project that I am winding up\n&gt;&gt; now is not life threatening, but because =\r\nof volume, it does\n&gt;&gt; need to be very fast and very accurate or the CEO wil=\r\nl be\n&gt;&gt; asking why it is failing to process about 2000 shipments an\n&gt;&gt; hour=\r\n! (Not a conversation that I ever want to have!) I still\n&gt;&gt; think that it&#39;s=\r\n appropriate to &quot;harden&quot; our code to handle\n&gt;&gt; the unexpected.\n&gt;\n&gt;Aren&#39;t th=\r\ne goals of fast code, robust code (against misuse) and fast\n&gt;development ra=\r\nther competing?\n\nI&#39;m not sure that I would describe it as competing, rather=\r\n as challenging. We have succeeded, so I think that I have some standing to=\r\n comment on this matter. (Our business sponsor actually smiles when she att=\r\nends our demos! :-)\n\nGoing back to your earlier point of providing guard co=\r\nnditions for only the public API, that is exactly what we did. We even went=\r\n so far as to create a real API for our system (callled API.java) to separa=\r\nte the web based front end from the back end business logic. Every call wen=\r\nt through the API. All our method signatures were very specific data passin=\r\ng objects and we tested for nulls and invalid arguments as soon as possible=\r\n so that the back end of the system was given the cleanest possible data. W=\r\ne achieved speed by pre-caching (and validating the data at pre-cache time)=\r\n.\n\n&gt;&gt; This is the concept of &quot;graceful degredation&quot;. A web browser\n&gt;&gt; is a =\r\nvery good example of this .... a lot of web pages have\n&gt;&gt; awful HTML and ye=\r\nt most of them display acceptably, because\n&gt;&gt; the browser takes what it&#39;s g=\r\niven and does the best it can\n&gt;&gt; with it. A browser cannot throw an excepti=\r\non, but it can try\n&gt;&gt; to render what it&#39;s given. All software should do the=\r\n best it\n&gt;&gt; can with what it&#39;s given or when possible reject unacceptable i=\r\nnputs.\n&gt;\n&gt;Yes, it probably is a good idea to make the external interface ra=\r\nther\n&gt;robust. But I think that the balance changes for internal communicati=\r\non\n&gt;of the system.\n\nAgain, I completely agree.\n\n&gt;Regards, Ilja\n\nSimon\n\n----=\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------\nSimon P.
