You will need to use the /combination/ to restrict threadCount. Since=\r\n you&#39;re a selenium user you WILL need to limit threads, which means you *ca=\r\nnnot* get by with just junit 4.7+, but you *will* need ConfigurableParallel=\r\nComputer.\n\nI will update the surefire docs to be a bit clearer on this rest=\r\nriction.\n\nI know at least three selenium projects that are doing exactly wh=\r\nat you want. Most run with parallel=3Dclasses and a thread restriction, sin=\r\nce this allows a smooth number of concurrent tests, something that is good =\r\nfor your grid. My current firefox runs went from 45 minutes single thread t=\r\no 8 minutes concurrent, so there&#39;s definitely a huge upside.\n\nThis does not=\r\n mean it&#39;s a simple task, since most selenium test suites are not written w=\r\nith concurrency support in mind. Quite frankly, if you think getting surefi=\r\nre/junit to work is hard you can rest assured that the worst part is still =\r\nahead of you.\n\n\n\n \n\n\n",
