Twice in two days, I  \nhave found a use for something which junit doesn&#39;t seem to provide. I  \nwanted to check if I was doing something wrong.\n\nI have a couple of similar classes A, B, C, that implement the same  \ninterface. So I create test classes TestA, TestB and TestC. But all  \nthe tests in these are really the same, with just different setup. So  \nI&#39;d like to create a base test class, BaseTest. I&#39;ll put all my @Test  \nmethods here. In TestA, TestB and TestC, I&#39;ll just have my @Before  \nmethods. When I try to get junit to run my TestA/TestB/TestC, it  \ndoesn&#39;t find any tests, because it appears to be looking for tests in  \nthose classes only and not any superclasses. The best I&#39;ve been able  \nto do is to override the same test methods in TestA, TestB and TestC,  \nwhere each method simply calls the corresponding superclass method.\n\nI&#39;m using junit 4 and doing this in eclipse. Anything wrong in what  \nI&#39;m doing/assuming ? I&#39;ve checked the FAQ and done some google  \nsearches, but didn&#39;t find anything.\n\n      thanks\n\n      Srinivas\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n",
