We assume 0 means success, non-0 otherwise.<br/>\nPersonally I wish the errors and failures were rolled into just<br/>\n1 category (a bug is a bug).<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you are curious, the log gets emailed out to the team with a subject<br/>\nthat mentions (sucess) or (errors) depending on if everything was ok.<br/>\nBasically ksh/cron type stuff, which uses the exit codes to detect<br/>\nerrors. Since it gets emailed out every night, it detects lapses in<br/>\njudgement at most 24 hours after they happen and alerts everybody.<br/>\nMostly the integration type tests fail though (which are not implemented<br/>\nwith junit) because of database issues, or the build fails because<br/>\npermissions in CVS are wrong... stuff like that. So then you can look<br/>\nat the attachements (log files, junit textui output) to figure out what<br/>\nwent wrong when the subject says &quot;... (errors) ...&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe use ksh, perl, tcsh and bash across several unix flavors (sgi and<br/>\nsolaris, mainly) and cygwin under windows.<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope that helps you. Let me know if you require further details.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nChester Kustarz 2<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.monkey.org/~chester\">http://www.monkey.org/~chester</a></div>",
