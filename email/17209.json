Extracting data <br/>\nfrom a file consists of two operations:<br/>\n<br/>\n1. Loading file contents into memory, usually as lines of text.<br/>\n2. Parsing the lines of text while in memory.<br/>\n<br/>\nPart #1 is a perfect candidate for a reusable library. In Ruby, you <br/>\nsimply say file.readlines(), for example. There&#39;s no reason to <br/>\nreimplement this the way we do in Java. (Does Java 5 have a built-in <br/>\nlibrary method for loading a text file yet?!)<br/>\n<br/>\nPart #2 is what&#39;s specific to your application, because it depends on <br/>\nhow you formatted the text when you saved it. I could see that being a <br/>\nprivate method, perhaps, that takes a List of lines and parses them.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo it might be that the only reason the &quot;loading&quot; feature is not <br/>\nreusable is that Java hasn&#39;t made the reusable part reusable!<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJ.
