I&#39;m not exactly sure what you mean by\n&gt; &quot;Monostate,&quot; but I understand your concern on the static methods. \n\nA Monostate is like an inside-out Singleton: all its fields and methods \nare class-level (static) so although it looks like a normal object, no \nmatter how many of them you instantiate, they all look the same. (There \nis no instance-level data to differentiate different instances.) Any \nclass with all class-level methods is effectively a Monostate.\n\n&gt; My\n&gt; developers&#39; group is meeting on Wednesday and one of the topics is\n&gt; going to be allowing my project to use Spring. If that happens, I will\n&gt; eliminate the AppProperties and have each component that needs\n&gt; properties have a setter for the specific property.\n\nI would do that, anyway: with Spring or without, your application&#39;s \nentry point should make the decision about where application properties \ncome from, then hand those property /values/ to the objects that need \nthem. (If you can&#39;t do this easily, then that might signal the part of \nthe design that needs attention next.)\n\n&gt; Also, I ordered your book from Amazon about three weeks ago and I am\n&gt; anxiously awaiting its arrival (it is supposed to be delivered\n&gt; 7/12-7/28). I have heard nothing but rave reviews.\n\n1. I hope you enjoy it.\n2. If you enjoy it, please review it.\n3. If you don&#39;t enjoy it, just throw it in the trash, e-mail me, then \nkeep quiet about it. :)\n\nThanks.\n-- \nJ. B.
