To /manually/ verify the /automated/ \n&gt; test did not fail? Collecting test results (whether tests fail or \npass) is JUnit&#39;s job, not the tester&#39;s -- that&#39;s why it is an \nautomated test.  \n\nI think we are coming from different places. Maybe its my Smalltalk \nbackground. I dont want to get too OT but maybe a specific example \nwill help. I&#39;m now in early development of a mapping a business \nobject model in TOPLink. I want to evaluate expressions which read my \nobjects from the db to test my mappings. If that doesnt blow up (and \nit does, a LOT, right now), I want to play around with that instance \nin an inspector, send messages to it, fix the toString(), test lazy \ninstantiation of its parts, add some behavior, debug, etc, all in the \ncontext of a live instance. In short I want to _interact_ with the \nobject.\n\nHowever since I am going to the trouble to create this test code \nwhich produces those objects, I would like to institutionalize those \nsnippets into a test suite so I and other team members can reuse them \neasily in the same manner. That&#39;s why I dont want the code in a \nscrapbook window. I&#39;m less interested in the automated test aspect \nright now. \n\nFor other projects I have worked differently. For example, \nI built a Java parser and all I needed were automated tests \n(thousands of them). I didnt have to interact with any objects. I \nusually just asserted that the parsetree toString() looked like the \nsource string (actually this happened to be in Smalltalk with sUnit). \nSo I am familiar with that way of working as well.\n\n\n&gt; I don&#39;t understand what you mean by cataloging.\n\nI mean I want to elevate my test artifacts from workspacewindow \nsnippets to code which is managed by the version control system (Envy \netc), available to team members, etc. And yes for automated testing \neventually. \n\n&gt; Neither do I understand what bothers you about having tests in the \n&gt; development workspace. After all, tests belong to the development?\n\nI hope I clarified this above and also the premise that one might not \nonly or even primarily be interested in the automation aspect of \njunit for a given situation.\n\n&gt; It&#39;s in src.jar in the JUnit directory.\n\nThanks very much.\n\n\n",
