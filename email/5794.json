Mocking the library sounds like a good idea, and you have an<br/>\ninteresting technique for doing that. I don&#39;t understand this<br/>\nparagraph:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;What I dislike is that my tests are in fact splitted into the JUnit <br/>\n&gt;test case part and the C dummy library part and I would prefer them to<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;be just JUnit tests.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You wrote that your tests were all written with JUnit, so I don&#39;t<br/>\nunderstand this statement. The tests you wrote to test talking to the<br/>\nlibrary, are they not written in JUnit?<br/>\n<br/>\nEven if they are not, what problem do you have because they are not<br/>\nwritten in JUnit? What are they written in?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Can anybody provide me a good link on JNI testing or has someone <br/>\n&gt;experienced similar problems? <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Not me. I hope someone else has links for you and I hope Mike puts them<br/>\ninto our FAQ. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nJ. B.
