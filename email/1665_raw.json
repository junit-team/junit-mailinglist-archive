It\ncalled the bean directly, not through the home/remote i/f. It allowed me to\ntest during the build process.\n\nI think running the tests after we deploy is probably the best bet.

Just treat them as regular classes. We\ntreat a JUnit as any client to the EJB and test all the public methods.\nWe did not have any problem so far testing our EJB&#39;s this way. As John\nmentioned in setUp create the EJB and in the tear down delete it.\n\nSameera\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: John Stetic [mailto:johns@...]\nSent: Tuesday, June 26, 2001 9:38 AM\nTo: &#39;junit@yahoogroups.com&#39;\nSubject: RE: [junit] How to test EJBs?\n\n\nYour post is kind of vague.  You are asking a big question.  We are just\ntreating EJB like any other classes.  We create the EJB in the set up\nmethod\nand then delete it in the tear down.  As long as you have the EJB\ndeployed\nto a running app server, your off to the races.\n\nThis is really a good topic for discussion.  Anyone else what to share\nthere\nexperiences with EJB testing?  I have heard allot about Cactus, How does\nit\nfit in to the whole thing?  (Now my post is the vague one &lt;grin&gt;)\n\nJohn\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: David Thielen [mailto:dthielen@...]\nSent: June 26, 2001 10:29 AM\nTo: junit@yahoogroups.com\nSubject: RE: [junit] How to test EJBs?\n\n\nHi;\n\nAsking again in the hope that someone has a good solution for this.\n\nthanks - dave\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: David Thielen [mailto:dthielen@...]\nSent: Monday, June 25, 2001 9:04 AM\nTo: Junit\nSubject: [junit] How to test EJBs?\n\n\nHi;\n\nIs there any good test framework for testing EJBs?\n\nthanks - dave\nTo unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\njunit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n\n\nYour use of Yahoo!
