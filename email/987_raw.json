This should work okay as long as the same XML processor produced the file.  If different XML\nprocessors are involved you may have issues relating to whitespace, line terminators and attribute ordering that makes\nthis method impractical.  There is a utility called dgnorm.exe that is part of the XSLTMark benchmark that will\nnormalise these factors to allow you to compare output from different processors (see:\nhttp://www.datapower.com/XSLTMark/).\n\nThere is also a tool from IBM&#39;s Alphaworks site, XML Diff and Merge, that can be executed as a command and will produce\nan xml file summarising the differences between files.\n\nNot much JUnit stuff here but it is doable.\n\nI&#39;m looking at putting something together that will do this from a pair pre-existing DOM tree (or a file or a\ncombination of these) but I&#39;m only just starting this now.  Let&#39;s see how I go using my spare time over the next couple\nmonths.\n\nGood luck,\n\nScott\n-----------------------------------\nScott Eade\nBackstage Technologies Pty.
