    "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-222214869\">I wrote a simple shell script that pulled out the particular methods <br/>\nbeing touched by any given set of code using javap.  You could just as <br/>\neasily use that to peer into your test code to ascertain what methods <br/>\nare actually being executed.  Then diff against all available methods <br/>\n(again javap is your friend here) to have a pretty clear picture of what <br/>\nexactly is being touched, not just what classes are being touched.  <br/>\nAutomating this task wouldn&#39;t be a horrid undertaking either.<br/>\n<br/>\nI tried to put a little polish on this script before including it in <br/>\nthis email to make it hopefully useful but no guarantees.

To recap:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The filename matching system that David proposed was my first thought as<br/>\n&gt; well and it could be implemented as an Ant task easily enough so that<br/>\n&gt; can be<br/>\n&gt; used to fail a build if a test case is missing, etc... I had started to<br/>\n&gt; write this utility when I decided to email the list and make sure I<br/>\n&gt; wasn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; re-inventing the wheel. I think that this approach is a good first step<br/>\n&gt; but<br/>\n&gt; it doesn&#39;t give us a look into the code and it would be difficult to<br/>\n&gt; handle<br/>\n&gt; interfaces (for which I rarely write a unit test).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I looked at NoUnit but I cannot get it to run with Java 1.4 -- it looks<br/>\n&gt; promising though. Quilt is the most ambitious of the open source<br/>\n&gt; projects<br/>\n&gt; and it also looks to be very promising -- but is still pre-alpha and<br/>\n&gt; probably not ready for use in a corporate setting.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Integration with Ant is, of-course, a big plus for any utility that can<br/>\n&gt; be<br/>\n&gt; used for this task. Looks like there&#39;s some definate room for<br/>\n&gt; improvement in<br/>\n&gt; this area. Does anyone else have some suggestions?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Chris<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Vladimir Bossicard [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:vladimir@...\">vladimir@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Tuesday, February 05, 2002 9:33 AM<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: [junit] checking for test coverage<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Does anyone know of any utilities that can check for test coverage.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; You can have a look at Quilt: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://quilt.sourceforge.net\">http://quilt.sourceforge.net</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Off the record: it would be interesting to know what is the average<br/>\n&gt; coverage of the Test First Design method: 80%, 90%, 95%, 100%?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -Vladimir<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --<br/>\n&gt; Vladimir Bossicard<br/>\n&gt; www.bossicard.com<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>",
