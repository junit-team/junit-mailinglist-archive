An &#39;inner&#39; class \nMUST be bound to an instance of the outer class, and thus can&#39;t be \nstatic.  What you are talking about here I think is referred to as a \n&#39;nested&#39; class.  Which is declared exactly like you would expect a \n&#39;static inner class&#39; to be declared if that&#39;s what it was called:-).  I \nremember hearing the term &#39;top level nested class&#39;  I think it was in \nan article on jRoundup.com.\n\n\nI don&#39;t agree.  For one reason, the type-safe-enum pattern is still a\nviable pattern.  I often use StICs to represent these.  I know that it\nisn&#39;t necessary, but it helps a great deal in packaging my classes\naccording to intent of use.\n\nAlso, in my tests I will often times create a mock object as a StIC that\nis either the only implementation of an interface/abstract class in the\ntesting world, or is just a very specific implementation of it.\n\nI will post examples if anyone is interested.\n\n=jason\n\n\n",
