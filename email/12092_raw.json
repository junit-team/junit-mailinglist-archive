The proof of whether or not it is suited to \na  \n&gt; particular need is an exercise left to the reader.  You are \ncorrect that  \n&gt; your question is very broad.  A better answer may come if you take \nthe  \n&gt; time to define your needs to us.\n\nFirst thanks thanks for a response to my question. \n\nI know Junit was developed with unit testing of everything that is \njava. The basic concepts and methods of testing strings, hash tables \nand other objects created in classes and their methods is not that \nhard to understand. \n\nBut the question I didn&#39;t ask and should have is about testing \nserver objects. BroadVision has many server objects (Site, User, \nSession, HttpRequests, ...) that are passed to the classes and are \nneeded to perform the logic contained in them. I have been reading \nabout HttpUnit and ServletUnit and it seems that if I am going to \nwrite successful unit tests employing JUnit, I am going to have to \nsomehow get these objects from the server. So while I can write a \nTestSuite which has some values that I will be testing against, how \nam I suppose to get the BV Server to supply the objects that only A \nBV server can provide? Do I need to integrate Cactus, or one of the \nother Unit testing modules to make this happen? I guess I am looking \nfor any suggestions or recommendations of what will provide the \nserver interaction with Junit. While hard coding values in a test \nsuite provides adequate testing for some things it won&#39;t cut it for \ndynamic server objects that can&#39;t be replicated by static values. \nThe last thing I want to do is strip classes of the logic that \nrequire those values because it couldn&#39;t possibly provide adequate \nor realistic testing scenarios or environments that I am testing for \nin the first place.\n\n\nEric\n\n\n\n",
