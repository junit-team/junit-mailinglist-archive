B. Rainsberger [jbrains@...] replied:\n  &gt;But probably NOT within my desired effort level. ;-)\n\n  Understood, but if it has to be done, then it has to be done....\n\nBut I don&#39;t think it should have to be done. I think it is a perfectly fair\nthing to see removed from manual maintenance.\n\n  JUnit provides a simple, default way to build a test suite from a TestCase\nsubclass. Beyond that, it&#39;s your job to build the suite you want. My point\nis simple -- and I think you keep missing it -- do whatever you need to\nbuild a test suite, but don&#39;t mistake those custom building process for\nsomething that belongs in the framework. Don&#39;t confuse TestSuite, which is\npart of the framework, with creating instances of TestSuite, which is your\njob. To make it simpler, JUnit provides one way to do it....\n\nI&#39;ve not been missing your point (not completely, although I get it more\neach time) but this is the crux of my argument: If (big IF) suites are\ntestcase dependencies, then I don&#39;t think it ought be the user&#39;s job to\nmanage them -- I think the framework should. It is easy for me (outside the\ncode) to say this, but I think they were a useful construct before, but they\nmay have outlived their usefulness. I posit that suites are the existing\nhammer, so they are making things seem like a nail.\n\n    &gt;My examples were just simple ones. Dependency can be in the eye of the\n    &gt;beholder... :-)\n\n    I don&#39;t know that it can be: dependency is or is not.\n\nI was saying dependency due to aggregation, you were saying dependency due\nto feature. I was agreeing that users could set dependency for whatever\nreason they chose.\n\n\n      &gt;Declarative verses &quot;procedural&quot;.\n\n      Implementation details.\n\nI disagree, I believe it is usability, if not plain functionality.\n\n\n      Maybe I misunderstand Test Collectors -- point me to something to\nlearn more, if you don&#39;t mind\n     -- but don&#39;t they just       create TestSuite objects?\n\nUnfortunately I don&#39;t have that information, I know they scan classpaths and\nmatch class patterns (e.g. *Test*). I assume they build a testsuite (or\ncollection of such) but I don&#39;t know, sorry. Taking a brief look at some ant\ncode they may even use an array/enumeration of testcases & their own runner,\nbut I can&#39;t be sure.\n\n      Your way to declare a test suite is already supported by JUnit and a\nlittle    cute refactoring.\n\n      Consider the AllTests pattern. I can reduce it to a collection of\nAllTests or  TestCase class names with a little neat refactoring. Then I can\nuse that little engine to store AllTests as text. The next step is to\ngenerate that text by doing a directory scan. Now I have a TestSuite builder\nthat build tests from a part of the file system.\n\n      I did nothing to change JUnit. I just decorated it. Does it belong in\nthe framework? I don&#39;t think so. That&#39;s a question of taste, in my opinion.\n\nGreat explanation of your position, and good summary of the crux of this\ndiscussion as it stands. My views to follow.\n\nSo I think we understand each other quite well -- I just don&#39;t understand\nwhy you think this feature you suggest should be part of the framework? Why\nisn&#39;t it a candidate for JUnit-addons or something like that?\n\nA few responses:\n\n1) Perhaps set the clock back. What say the original implementation had test\ncase dependency, not test suites. Who is to say that suites warrant\ninclusion but dependencies do not? Maybe suites must stay  for backwards\ncompatibility (although I feel they are declining in usage) but why oughtn&#39;t\ndependency be there?\n\n2) I think dependency needs to be managed on the testcase, hence be an\noptional aspect of that class. I think separating this out into a separate\nstructure (like suite) is a recipe for rust. ***This is why I think it needs\nto be part of the framework, not an add on.***\n\n3) Given test collectors (classpath/directory scanners) -- and given things\nlike Eclipse testcase wizards --- I believe suites are fading out of\nconsciousness. As such, I think it is less to learn to say &quot;my testcase\ndepends upon these testcases&quot; than learn a the testsuite concept.\n\n4) I believe (IMHO -- w/ no market research, just based on projects I know)\nthat dependency has great user benefit than manual test suite. As such, I&#39;d\nlike it in the framework to aid the most users.\n\nRemember that my goal -- Kent&#39;s goal, too -- is to keep JUnit very tight and\nsmall. It should provide just enough for everyone, rather than a glut of\nfeatures that have limited use. The less to learn, the better. If you need\nmore, grab add-on package X, add-on package Y and add-on package Z.\n\nI can understand that goal, and I might agree w/ it academically. That said,\nI think product purity comes (a close) second to usability. And even with\nthat said, I don&#39;t see how your goal counters what I suggested & doesn&#39;t fit\nit.\n\n      Also, the more magic in the package, the less the users need to learn\nto use it. I want them to know what they&#39;re doing.\n\nMy goal is better testing through easier test management, easier test result\nanalysis. That said, I don&#39;t see how the approach I am suggesting doesn&#39;t\nfit this.\n\n\nBTW: Long before the end of this mail I&#39;ve started to realize that this\nwhole e-mail chain is an academic exercise, unlikely to result in change.\nJUnit still rocks, and I use it fervently, this was just a random thought\nthat seemed to feel like an epiphany so I posted it...\n\nregards,\n\nAdam\n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n",
