As part of that our goal is to never release code that is\n&gt; untested, and we use the available tools to try to accomplish that goal.\n\n&gt; I have been reading this thread with interest, and am a little confused\n&gt; over the argument.  I liked Bob Martin&#39;s analogy of double entry \n&gt; bookkeeping, and this may be part of the confusion. As far as I know, it\n&gt; doesn&#39;t matter whether the credit is put into the books first, or the\n&gt; debit is done first. The value of the practice is that both entries have\n&gt; to be done, and both must match. We do some test first, and some test\n&gt; second, but everything gets tested.\n\nTesting everything is a good thing. An important difference between\nTDD and double entry bookkeeping is that it /does/ matter whether we\ndo the test or the code first.\n\nThe most apparent reason is that the test is a /user/ of the code\nand the code is an /implementer/ of the usage. So when we write the\ntest first, we are designing the interface to our code from the\nviewpoint of a user and when we write the code first, we have (more)\nthe viewpoint of the implementer.\n\nI often find that I&#39;ll write the first few tests a couple of times,\nstopping part way through each one. I&#39;ll muse about how the object\nshould be built and called ... start writing the test ... not like\nthe interface ... change it.\n\nThen I make that test work and do it again ... I learn more about\nthe interface ... perhaps change it again.\n\nWhen I write the code first, I find that I&#39;m less likely to change\nit when I find it hard to use.\n\nIt could be just me. I&#39;m not saying what I do is better -- I&#39;m\nreporting how it&#39;s different.\n\n&gt; In fact our model is a back and forth approach. We write a few tests\n&gt; based on a use case, and they fail. We write the code to support those\n&gt; tests, and (in the process) write support code to make the test driven\n&gt; code compile and pass it&#39;s tests. Then we write the tests for the \n&gt; support code, and the tests for the next use case, this leads to writing\n&gt; both the code to pass the tests, and some underlying code, which calls\n&gt; for a few more test cases. These latter tests are driven by the need to\n&gt; test corner conditions in the support code which may not be exercised by\n&gt; a specific instance of the use-case driven code.\n\n&gt; This back and forth approach seems natural, it reduced context switching\n&gt; in the design/implement domain, and seems to work well.  What am I missing?\n\nYou may not be missing anything. Personally, I like the context\nswitching. It keeps my mind fresh, and ensures that I don&#39;t get\nlocked in on a direction that turns out not to be what it should be.\n\nI have this unsupported theory that &quot;corner cases&quot; in my code\nrepresent design flaws, so I try to produce code that doesn&#39;t have\nsuch things. I could be completely wrong about that whole notion.\n\nRon Jeffries\nwww.XProgramming.com\nIf it is more than you need, it is waste. -- Andy Seidl\n\n\n",
