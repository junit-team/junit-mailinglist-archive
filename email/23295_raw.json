From a j=\r\nava point of view it is impossible. So how do you\n&gt; circumvent this problem=\r\n and how do you make sure your private methods\n&gt; perform correctly?\n&gt; Any c=\r\nomment welcome.\n\nI&#39;ve just released a new tool that should solve that probl=\r\nem for you. After several patches =3D), your java interface is that you can=\r\n test private methods (i.e. just access it as you would would it have been =\r\npublic) and then behind the scenes at compile-time your &#39;illegal access&#39; is=\r\n replaced with the equivalent Reflection API calls, i.e. your test will com=\r\npile and run.\n\nYou can check it out at www.dp4j.com\n\nFeedback is welcome.  =\r\n\n\n\n",
