With that in mind, I figured if i <br/>\n&gt; could help autogenerate some basic testing codes to get them off on <br/>\n&gt; a start, they could get the hang of it and probably improve on the <br/>\n&gt; tests generated later.<br/>\n &gt;<br/>\n&gt; Erm does that make sense?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Mhh, I&#39;m not sure how allowing &quot;them&quot; to *not* write the tests first <br/>\nwill help them come to value *writing* the tests first.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is also my experience that the best way to learn TDD is to really <br/>\ntest and code in *very* tiny steps. Your proposed tool seems to <br/>\n*increase* the size of the first step (generating a whole bunch of <br/>\nassertions before writing the first production code), which seems to go <br/>\nagainst the flow of TDD and I&#39;d fear will in fact obscure the main <br/>\nbenefit of TDD - driving you to design your production code in mini steps.<br/>\n<br/>\nI can imagine that going all those mini steps can feel tedious at the <br/>\nbeginning (although I don&#39;t remember having felt that way). I&#39;m not sure <br/>\nthat taking a shortcut will help much with the learning, though. I&#39;d <br/>\nimagine that making those mini steps become *more fun* - perhaps by <br/>\nmaking kind of game out of it - could be more effective...<br/>\n<br/>\nJust my 0.02,<br/>\n<br/>\nIlja</div>",
