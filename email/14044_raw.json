I have written a\nlibrary \nof which I need to test one class. The methods exposed by this class \ncannot be called randomly but by following some rules. For example, \nthere is a method &quot;Connect&quot; which must be invoked before any other \nmethod is called. There are additional calls that are related. For \nexample &quot;ChangeHeaders&quot; makes temporary change to some data (after \nsome business logic verification), however this must be followed by a \ncall to &quot;SaveChanges&quot; to persist this data. Whatever I have read\nabout \nJUnit seems to indicate that the test methods in my test class can be \ncalled in any order by the JUnit framework. Is there any way (a \npattern) to get around this issue ? Thanks much in advance..\n\nRegards,\nArnab.\n\n\n\n\n\n",
