I also found the Ant issue after a quick google. \n\nI =\r\nguess I was more interested on how Ant is extracting the information\nout of=\r\n JUnit. I was hoping to avoid creating my own runner/formatter\nto directly =\r\nrun and monitor the JUnit executions (just to get this\ninfo). Is there any =\r\nway, short of that, to get JUnit to &quot;report&quot; which\ntests were ignored and w=\r\nhy?\n\nFYI, I&#39;ve built a small utility class that grovels over the test\nclass=\r\nes/methods looking for &quot;@Ignore&quot; annotations and spits out the\ndesired info=\r\n already. It just seems like this functionality should be\nbuilt-in already.=\r\n\n\nBob\n\n--- In junit@yahoogroups.com, &quot;yme0987654321&quot; &lt;yme0987654321@...&gt; wr=\r\note:\n&gt;\n&gt; This is a known issue in Ant:\n&gt; \n&gt; https://issues.apache.org/bugzi=\r\nlla/show_bug.cgi?id=3D43969\n&gt; \n\n\n",
