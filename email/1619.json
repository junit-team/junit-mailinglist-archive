The LoadTest is useful to help verify that <br/>\nthe decorated test produces the expected results under various load <br/>\nlevels.  A LoadTest can then be decorated with a TimedTest to <br/>\nautomatically check that the load test meets an expected latency.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are a number of good load testing tools on the market, and <br/>\nJUnitPerf doesn&#39;t attempt to match their features.  Rather, JUnitPerf is <br/>\nintended to be used to keep an automatic check on expected results <br/>\nresponse times in the spirit of relentless refactoring and testing.<br/>\n<br/>\nMike<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nMike Clark<br/>\nClarkware Consulting, Inc.<br/>\nCustom Software Architecture, Design,<br/>\nDevelopment, and Performance Consulting<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.clarkware.com\">http://www.clarkware.com</a></div>",
