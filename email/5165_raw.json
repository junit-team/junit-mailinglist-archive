Would you share\nsome successful strategy by which you accomplished in doing that?\n\nThank you,\nLuca Sfarzo\nTRSNeapolis\nTel:+390815272842\n\n\n\n-----Messaggio originale-----\nDa: Timothy Wall [mailto:twall@...]\nInviato: martedi 11 giugno 2002 16.12\nA: junit@yahoogroups.com\nOggetto: Re: R: [junit] gui testing\n\n\nOr try this (a real-world case):\n\nI&#39;m editing a field in my form, and something happens asynchronously\nsuch that the action of editing a field in the form is no longer valid.\nThere are several options of what to do at the interface level (with\nvarying degrees of UI acceptableness and programmatic complexity), but\nyour mediator knows nothing of the editor, nor of how it relates to the\nform, or of any other transient objects that may be introduced (dialogs,\nswapped-out panes) in order to rectify the situation.\n\nThe programmatic easy-to-test solution may not be the one required for\nusability of the UI.\n\n...\n\n\n...\n\n\nYour use of Yahoo!
