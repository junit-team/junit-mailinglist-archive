There&#39;s some functionality I had built for myself in the land of \nJUnit 3, and I&#39;m trying to figure out how best to replicate it in JUnit \n4. Let me explain it in two parts.\n\nThe first part is something that finds all my tests (by walking the \nfilesystem) and then runs them.\n\nThe second part is a way for me to segregate different sorts of tests so \nthat I can run them conditionally. I previously used annotations, \nincluding something akin to the @Ignore annotation that I&#39;m pleased to \nsee is now included. I also had something like @Category(&quot;slow&quot;), which \nallowed me to kick slow tests out of the common target that developers run.\n\n\nFor the first part, I found this chunk of code, so I didn&#39;t have to \nwrite that myself:\n\nhttp://burtbeckwith.com/blog/?p=52\n\nBut now that I&#39;m looking to add the second part to it, it seems awkward \nenough that I wonder if I&#39;m going about it wrong.\n\nWithin this structure, it looks like I could use per-class annotations \nto kick entire classes out of the set of tests to run. But is there a \nreasonable way I could use annotations on individual methods to include \nor exclude them from the set of tests to run?\n\n\nThanks,\n\nWilliam\n\n\n\n",
