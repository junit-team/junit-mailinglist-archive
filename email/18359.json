I was trying to test and compare the code with something which was not known to me. May be I was trying to hit the problem in a black box way. I have gone through your sample code snippets send to me and I will try to break the code in such a way so that I can test it by comparing to some known values. That will I guess provide me with better stats !!<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks a Lot for your kind help <br/>\n<br/>\n-Avinash<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n----- Original Message ----<br/>\nFrom: Joakim Ohlrogge &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:joakim.ohlrogge@...\">joakim.ohlrogge@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSent: Tuesday, 14 November, 2006 6:01:36 PM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [junit] Promlem in writing Test case<br/>\n<br/>\nTo me it sounds like the first thing you need to do is take control of your<br/>\nenvironment from your tests.<br/>\nFrom what you wrote below maybe I would do something like this:<br/>\n<br/>\npublic TestVersionCalculat or extends TestCase {<br/>\n<br/>\npublic testCalculatorVersi onIsNewer_ ReturnsZero( ) {<br/>\nVersionCalculator calculator = new VersionCalculator( &quot;7.1.1&quot;);<br/>\nAssertEquals( &quot;0&quot;, calculator.calculat e(&quot;7.0.1&quot; ));<br/>\n}<br/>\n<br/>\npublic testCalculatorVersi onOlder_ReturnsN ewest() {<br/>\nVersionCalculator calculator = new VersionCalculator( &quot;6.1.5&quot;);<br/>\nAssertEquals( &quot;&quot;7.1.0&quot;&quot; , calculator.calculat e(&quot;7.1.0&quot; ));<br/>\n}<br/>\n}<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen that works I would maybe write a test for something that can read the<br/>\nXML so that if the XML contains a specific version I know that particular<br/>\nversion would be returned:<br/>\n<br/>\npublic void TestXmlVersionReade r extends TestCase {<br/>\npublic testReadsVersionFro mReader() {<br/>\nReader xmlInput = new StringReader( &quot;&lt;?xml version=&#39;1.0&#39; &#39;&gt;&lt;version&gt;<br/>\n7.0.1&lt;/version&gt; &quot;) ;<br/>\nVersionReader versionReader = new XmlVersionReader( xmlInput) ;<br/>\nAssertEquals( &quot;7.0.1&quot;, versionReader. readVersion( ));<br/>\n}<br/>\n<br/>\npublic testReadsVersionFro mReader() {<br/>\nReader xmlInput = new StringReader( &quot;&lt;?xml version=&#39;1.0&#39; &#39;&gt;&lt;version&gt;<br/>\n6.0.5&lt;/version&gt; &quot;) ;<br/>\nVersionReader versionReader = new XmlVersionReader( xmlInput) ;<br/>\nAssertEquals( &quot;6.0.5&quot;, versionReader. readVersion( ));<br/>\n}<br/>\n}<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen that works you have something that can read a version from your xml and<br/>\nsomething that can calculate a version.<br/>\nNow I would maybe revisit the first test again:<br/>\n<br/>\npublic TestVersionCalculat or extends TestCase {<br/>\n<br/>\npublic testCalculatorVersi onIsNewer_ ReturnsZero( ) {<br/>\nVersionCalculator calculator = new VersionCalculator( &quot;7.1.1&quot;,<br/>\n<br/>\nnew VersionReader( ) {<br/>\n<br/>\npublic String readVersion( ) {<br/>\n<br/>\nreturn &quot;7.0.1&quot;;<br/>\n<br/>\n}<br/>\n<br/>\n});<br/>\nAssertEquals( &quot;0&quot;, calculator.calculat e());<br/>\n}<br/>\n<br/>\npublic testCalculatorVersi onOlder_ReturnsN ewest() {<br/>\nVersionCalculator calculator = new VersionCalculator( &quot;6.1.5&quot;,<br/>\n<br/>\nnew VersionReader( ) {<br/>\n<br/>\npublic String readVersion( ) {<br/>\n<br/>\nreturn &quot;7.1.0&quot;;<br/>\n<br/>\n}<br/>\n<br/>\n});<br/>\nAssertEquals( &quot;&quot;7.1.0&quot;&quot; , calculator.calculat e());<br/>\n}<br/>\n}<br/>\n<br/>\nThat is just a simple example, where you start and the order things are<br/>\nimplemented is unimportant. The important thing is to identify<br/>\nresponsibilities and test them so that you are sure that they work. Some<br/>\nprefer to test larger chunks at the time, attack the problem from a<br/>\ndifferent direction and so on, that is ok too. The bottom line is that you<br/>\nhave to have a /known/ in your test. You have to know what the conditions<br/>\nare and how your system should behave with those conditions. Otherwise the<br/>\ntest will have to run the same code as the code that is tested which, as you<br/>\nsay, provides no value.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think you do know what to expect, there must be some rule, after all you<br/>\nknew how to write the code. I think the problem you are facing is that you<br/>\nmaybe want to run the tests in an environment that you don&#39;t control. Why do<br/>\nyou want to do that? What is the gain?.<br/>\nIf you take control of your environment the testing is simple and consists<br/>\nof figuring out how to force your system into situations in which you can be<br/>\nsure how it should respond and have enough of those situations so you can be<br/>\nsure that your system works. The real gain is when you can write those tests<br/>\nas you develop the code and be able to listen to your tests so that they can<br/>\ncontribute back to your design.<br/>\n<br/>\nDoes that make sense or am I completely missing something about what you are<br/>\ntrying to do?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On 11/14/06, avinash anand &lt;avinash_anand@ yahoo.co. uk&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hi Shane<br/>\n&gt; This here is something different.

The original class GetInfo.java has a<br/>\n&gt; method. String getSystemVersion( String str) which is under test.

What should<br/>\n&gt; be the actual and expected result. Meaning for getting the expected result I<br/>\n&gt; will have to use the same logic as it is in the main code, if I use the same<br/>\n&gt; logic to read the xml file then the assert statement would not be meaningful<br/>\n&gt; as then the expected and actual results would be same.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I am not sure why you have to use the same logic to calculate the<br/>\n&gt; expected result?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; You have an xml file that u will use for the test (I personally might<br/>\n&gt; do something different) in which you know what version you expect back<br/>\n&gt; ... so you code assert_equals( 0,<br/>\n&gt; getinfo.getSystemVe rsion(fileToRetu rnZero)) etc.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; cheers<br/>\n&gt; shane<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Send instant messages to your online friends <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://uk.messenger\">http://uk.messenger</a> .yahoo.com<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSend instant messages to your online friends <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://uk.messenger.yahoo.com\">http://uk.messenger.yahoo.com</a> <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed] </span></blockquote></div>",
