Can you re-post a link\n&gt; to one you recommend?\n\nAll of my experience with any of the public tools has been with JMock.\n JMock 1, available from\n\nhttp://jmock.org\n\nhas both the mocking library and the constraint library, with\nassertThat.  In the next generation, the constraint library has been\nrenamed to hamcrest, which is being developed independently:\n\nhttp://sourceforge.net/projects/hamcrest\n\nA warning: hamcrest uses (but doesn&#39;t, I believe, require) generic\ntypes.  I was one of several users pushing for this, but now that it&#39;s\nhere, I have mixed feelings about it.  I tend to believe the main\nissue isn&#39;t the generics themselves, but unnecessarily poor type\ninference from current compilers.  This is an orthogonal issue, with\nthe same kinds of benefits and drawbacks that would come from\ndeclaring assertEquals as\n\npublic &lt;T&gt; void assertEquals(T expected, T actual).\n\nHave fun,\n\n   David Saff\n\n",
