I don&#39;t <br/>\nmake any promises about that, but quite a bit of it is public in a <br/>\nseparate package. In XOM at least outside of samples and tests <br/>\neverything that&#39;s public (or protected) is published. This requires <br/>\ncareful thought and design, and you need to think twice (and then think <br/>\nagain) before making anything public. If you&#39;re wrong and something <br/>\nneeds to be public, you can always make it public later; but it&#39;s much <br/>\nharder to take a public method away.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe most common mistake that prevents unifying public and published is <br/>\nexcessive package differentiation. Too often code is separated into more <br/>\npackages than it needs to be. As I said earlier, this should be less of <br/>\na problem in future JDKs once package access can be extended into <br/>\nsubpackages.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nElliotte Rusty Harold  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:elharo@...\">elharo@...</a><br/>\nXML in a Nutshell 3rd Edition Just Published!<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.cafeconleche.org/books/xian3/\">http://www.cafeconleche.org/books/xian3/</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0596007647/cafeaulaitA/ref=nosim\">http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0596007647/cafeaulaitA/ref=nosim</a></div>",
