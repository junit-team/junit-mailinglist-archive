Th=\r\nat is why I suggested running as big part as possible outside the\ncontainer=\r\n during developmenttime.\n\nIf running your tests often does not feel that im=\r\nportant then by all means\nrun them inside a container. I&#39;m currently workin=\r\ng with weblogic and I can&#39;t\nimagine TDD:ing if I would need to deploy my ne=\r\nw code in the container in\norder to run my tests. It is simply too tedious.=\r\n In my case 95% of the code\nhas nothing to do with EJB:s whatsoever so i do=\r\nn&#39;t see that much added value\nof executing the unittests inside the contain=\r\ner.\n\nThat is just my opinion and also the reason why i don&#39;t know the answe=\r\nr to\nhow to run the tests inside the container. I never did it. Maybe it is=\r\n\neasier in other containers.\n\n/J\n\nOn 11/2/06, C=C3=A9dric Beust =E2=99=94 &lt;=\r\ncbeust@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;   On 11/2/06, Joakim Ohlrogge &lt;joakim.ohlrogg=\r\ne@...&lt;joakim.ohlrogge%40gmail.com&gt;&gt;\n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Extract as much =\r\nas possible to classes that can be tested outside of the\n&gt; &gt; application se=\r\nrver.
