An\nEJB container is an execution environment and business logic should not\ndepend on where it is executing. A combination of JUnit-tests without cactus\nand systemtests (executed as a client against the application deployed in a\ncontainer works well in our project). The latter is run with our homecooked\nacceptance testing framework and the former with junit. This is possible\nbecause our EJB:s are merely shells contining our services that are\nimplemented as pojos and tested outside the EJB.\n\nIt works well for us. Of course there are different ways to skin a cat :)\n\nOn 11/3/06, David Saff &lt;saff@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;   Just to clarify, on projects like this, I usually have two levels of\n&gt; tests:\n&gt; user tests that verify that the end user sees what she expects (running in\n&gt; the container, even through the browser), and developer tests that verify\n&gt; that my classes work as I expect. For user tests, it&#39;s essential to have\n&gt; all the components in place. For developer tests, it&#39;s counter-productive:\n&gt; I want to understand what my code does independently of what services are\n&gt; provided by third-party containers or servers, and I also want to run\n&gt; developer tests often and fast.\n&gt;\n&gt; I think this is the same thing Vishal is saying below, but I wanted a\n&gt; chance\n&gt; to rephrase it a little. Thanks,\n&gt;\n&gt; David Saff\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; On 11/2/06, Vishal Vishnoi &lt;vvishnoi@... &lt;vvishnoi%40bea.com&gt;&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Use Cactus\n&gt; &gt; (http://jakarta.apache.org/cactus/writing/howto_testcase.html). It&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; very easy to package you test and run them on server side. They also\n&gt; &gt; have documentation on how to test EJB or any regular JUnit test in the\n&gt; &gt; container.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; For higher level testing (i.e testing like a customer), if you need to\n&gt; &gt; verify something in container, then verify it in container. Don&#39;t try to\n&gt; &gt; run it outside, otherwise the whole purpose of testing is lost.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; --Vishal\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; lenniedg2000 wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Hi,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I&#39;m using Eclipse 3.2, Orion application server, J2EE 5.0, Oracle\n&gt; &gt; &gt; database.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I&#39;ve written a jUnit test but it doesn&#39;t run since it doesn&#39;t run\n&gt; &gt; &gt; within the application server &quot;container&quot; and so can&#39;t find the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; database data-sources that I&#39;ve setup.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; How can I run jUnit unit tests inside an application server\n&gt; &quot;container&quot;?\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Kind Regards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Lennie De Villiers\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; __________________________________________________________\n&gt; &gt; Notice: This email message, together with any attachments, may contain\n&gt; &gt; information of BEA Systems, Inc., its subsidiaries and affiliated\n&gt; &gt; entities, that may be confidential, proprietary, copyrighted and/or\n&gt; &gt; legally privileged, and is intended solely for the use of the individual\n&gt; &gt; or entity named in this message.
