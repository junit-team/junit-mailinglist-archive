Some people create mocks by<br/>\nsubclassing.  I disagree with that approach as it leaves to open to<br/>\nundesired &quot;real&quot; behaviour leaking into the mock.  My approach is to<br/>\nuse (first extracting as required) an interface for the behaviour to<br/>\nbe mocked.  Then the mock is completely standalone.  This was<br/>\noriginally a requirement for EasyMock, but I understand that<br/>\nrecent/upcoming versions  don&#39;t have that requirement.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is also a major benefit of using a Mock.  Not only does it let<br/>\nyou verify that the code under test is using the mocked object as<br/>\nexpected/required, but it replaces the real object (e.g. network,<br/>\ndatabase, etc.) lettin you isolate the code that the test is concerned<br/>\nwith.<br/>\n<br/>\nDave</div>",
