A=\r\npril 2003 09:46 schrieb javainsel:\n&gt; I wish I would be a expert to convince=\r\n you of a better approach than\n&gt; JUnit provides (and TDD).\nYou can&#39;t, becau=\r\nse Exceptions, Assertions, JUnit and Design by Contract are\nnot competing b=\r\nut complementary approaches on the same aspect: Increase the\nstability and =\r\nrobustness of code and decrease the number of bugs.\n&quot;DBC is better than JUn=\r\nit&quot; is like saying &quot;Bolts are better than glue&quot;.\n\n\n&gt; But I try.\nOf course y=\r\nou may.\n\n&gt; I consider Design by Contract to be suitable to replace JUnit an=\r\nd TDD\n&gt; completely. It can provide many benefits and by the same time not\n&gt;=\r\n having all the side effects that JUnit and TDD have. Examples are\n&gt; Eiffel=\r\n and Java Modelling Language (JML).\n&gt;\n&gt; Why? How? I&#39;ll explain.\n&gt;\n&gt; Testing=\r\n of the code (methods) can be done with precondition,\n&gt; invartiants and pos=\r\ntconditions (the contracts). Thats how I\n&gt; understand Design by Contract. Y=\r\nou write your method definition and\n&gt; then you write the contract for it. T=\r\nhen you implement your method.\nNo.\n\nYou must differ between:\na) External pr=\r\neconditions and postconditions.\nTextField tf =3D (TextField) e.getSource();=\r\n\nMyDate df =3D new MyDate();\ndf.setDayOfMonth(Integer.parseInt(tf.getText()=\r\n));\nDesign by Contract won&#39;t solve the problem, it could only help.\nSuch Pr=\r\neconditions currently must be solved using Exceptions.\nYou even don&#39;t use A=\r\nssertions for that, Exceptions are used there.\nDesignByContract can only he=\r\nlp by replacing\nif (day &lt; 1 || day &gt; 31) { throw new IllegalArgumentExcepti=\r\non(); }\nwith a contract. A more declarative way for restricting argument ra=\r\nnges is\nalways increasing robustness and therefore welcome.\nOr take a look =\r\nat the next() method of the interface Iterator. Design by\nContract won&#39;t he=\r\nlp you to avoid the problem of calling next() once too\noften.\n\n\nb) Internal=\r\n preconditions, postconditions and invariants.\nHere you may use Java assert=\r\nions, e.g.:\nint w =3D dice.roll();\nswitch (w) {\n    case 1: case 2: case 3:=\r\n case 4:\n        // do something\n        break;\n    default: // This must b=\r\ne a four-sided dice\n        assert false;\n}\n\nc) Complex processes.\nImagine =\r\nyou want to test a shopping cart system.\nTests might be:\n- - place no order=\r\n with a logged-in customer but an empty shopping cart.\n- - place an order w=\r\nith a logged-in customer and non-empty shopping cart\n- - place no order wit=\r\nh no logged-in customer\nOr how do you use DBC to verify that your classes c=\r\norrectly use the database?\n\nd) Contracts\nAnd there, differ between contract=\r\ns on interfaces and contracts on\nimplementations. Contracts on interfaces s=\r\nometimes simply *can&#39;t* be checked\nby the compiler. And contracts on user i=\r\nnput also can&#39;t be checked by the\ncompiler. So these Contracts are just a m=\r\nore convenient way for\nIllegalArgumentExceptions and IllegalStateExceptions=\r\n.\n\n\n&gt; Now the great thing: When you compile your code the implementation\n&gt; =\r\ncan be checked whether it obeys the contract. If not, a compile error\n&gt; is =\r\nthrown. That it!\nThis is a great feature, and DBC is welcome.\n\n&gt; No JUnit t=\r\nest needed! Not TDD needed!\nWrong.\nThere are enough things that DBC can&#39;t e=\r\nnsure to work correctly.\nJust because some parts of the system work accordi=\r\nngly to their contract and\nthey use each other in a correct way doesn&#39;t mea=\r\nn the system is bug-free.\n\nDon&#39;t understand me wrong, I am not against DBC,=\r\n I like DBC and I welcome DBC,\nDBC is very helpful. And DBC can even replac=\r\ne *some* Unit Tests and\nAssertions. But DBC cannot replace *all* Unit Tests=\r\n.\n\n&gt; Besides this, a contract serves as a documentation.\nSo do Unit Tests a=\r\nnd Javadoc. But I welcome DBC as an enrichment of that\ndocumentation.\n\n&gt; An=\r\nd it can use invariants which JUnit will always lack of.\nHow does JUnit lac=\r\nk of invariants? Or do you talk of *internal* invariants?\n\n&gt; Now come on an=\r\nd don&#39;t tell me: &quot;We always used JUnit, most people do,\n&gt; why do you little=\r\n inexperienced programer think you have a better\n&gt; idea than people like Ga=\r\nmma or Fowler?&quot;\nBut we do.\nIt&#39;s because we must use something exists. Until=\r\n SUN has made it part of the\nJava 2 SDK SE or at least published a JSR for =\r\nthe JCP, DBC for Java will\nremain a castle in the air, a pipe dream, a mira=\r\nge. Public add-ons for DBC\nwill not work because it&#39;s a feature the compile=\r\nr must support and the\ncompiler is not yet pluggable - look at AspectJ and =\r\ntheir problems, and I\ncouldn&#39;t use DBC together with AOP for that, and then=\r\n, I&#39;d prefer AOP over\nDBC, not because AOP could replace DBC in anyway, but=\r\n AOP adds much more\nfeature value to Java than DBC.\n\nI think if a DBC featu=\r\nre would exist, many would use it. But currently it\ndoesn&#39;t. It&#39;s just opti=\r\nonal for those seeking it, far away from being mature.\n\nI tell you, true DB=\r\nC will never be there in Java, similar to the fact that we\nwill never see t=\r\nrue aspect oriented programming in Java (the latter because\nonce a class is=\r\n loaded in Java, its methods can&#39;t be changed, and AspectJ is\nnot really as=\r\npect oriented because it can&#39;t provide aspects for classes not\ncompiled wit=\r\nh AspectJ).\n\n&gt; I am not satisfied with the JUnit and TDD &quot;paradigma&quot;. They =\r\nare\n&gt; originated because of a *poverty* in Java programing language.\nNo, th=\r\nat definitely is not true.\nThere are several kinds of tests:\n- - Unit-Tests=\r\n for a method\n- - Unit-Tests for classes\n- - Unit-Tests for sequences of me=\r\nthods\n- - Integration tests that test how some classes / methods work toget=\r\nher\n- - Framework-Tests\n\nVery many of these can&#39;t be replaced by DBC.\nAnd n=\r\not having a certain feature is not neccessarily a poverty.\nIn Java, not hav=\r\ning (manipulable) pointers is a missing feature but definitely\nthe opposite=\r\n of poverty.\n\n\n&gt; If Java would support proper Design by Contract and a comp=\r\niler for that\n&gt; than no one would bother with JUnit and TDD.\nWrong.\nIf Desi=\r\ngn By Contract Proposed would already be part of Java, even more people\nwou=\r\nld use JUnit and TDD because even more people would be aware of the need\nof=\r\n ways to increase stability and robustness of code and search for such\nways=\r\n, and DBC lacks many facilities Unit-Testing provides. That doesn&#39;t mean\nth=\r\nat DBC is bad and they wouldn&#39;t use it, they would use it. It&#39;s like with\ns=\r\nweets. If you don&#39;t know sweets, you don&#39;t search for them. If you know\ncho=\r\ncolate, you&#39;re curious wether there are other sweets, too.\n\nBut some things=\r\n can&#39;t be done with DBC. For instance, imagine you have a class\nthat access=\r\nes a database. You want to know if the class makes correct use of\nthe inter=\r\nface and *also* correctly deals with problems (exceptions etc.)\n*and* also =\r\nuses the correct data.\nWith JUnit, just use some Dummies, Stubs and Mocks i=\r\nnstead of the real\ndatabase connection and you know wether your code works =\r\ncorrectly.\nThis is something you simply *can&#39;t* completely cover with DBC.\n=\r\nDBC can make some of these tests superflous, but others will persist still\n=\r\nbeing required.\n\n\n\nI appreciate your engagement for DBC. I&#39;m a fan of DBC m=\r\nyself and I&#39;ve already\nexperimented with DBC a bit.\n\nBut &quot;DBC is better tha=\r\nn JUnit&quot; is like saying &quot;Bolts are better than glue&quot;.\nIn the best case scen=\r\nario, you could use both.\nJava has no DBC. So instead of telling JUnit user=\r\ns Bolts are better than glue\nyou should tell SUN to provide bolts in the fi=\r\nrst place.\n\nGo ahead, go to the Java website and vote for DBC, as I have al=\r\nready done,\nthat&#39;s much more helpful.\nhttp://developer.java.sun.com/develop=\r\ner/bugParade/bugs/4449383.html\n\nLast but not least, just because a feature =\r\nis good it needn&#39;t neccessarily be\nimplemented in the language. Otherwise, =\r\nwe&#39;d create a darn heavy mixture of\nC, Java, Perl, SmallTalk, Eiffel, Lisp,=\r\n Prolog and XSLT:\n\n/** Print all those elements of an array that have strin=\r\ng representations\nstarting with white space.\n * @... some list\n * =\r\n@... some list containing elements with strings starting with\nwhi=\r\ntespace\n*/\npublic static void somemethod(@[/^&#92;s/]) {\n    print for (@ARGV);=\r\n\n}\n\n/** Print all elements of a list.\n * @... some list\n * @privat=\r\ne.param $_ list head\n * @... @list tail of list, if empty $_ is p=\r\nrinted and method\nreturns immediatly\n*/\npublic static printList($_, @list[.=\r\nlength&gt;0 :|| print && return]) {\n    return print && printList @list; // pr=\r\nint $_ and recurse\n}\nor alternatively\npublic static printList($_, @_) {\n   =\r\n return print && printList @_;\n}\npublic static printList($_) {\n    return p=\r\nrint;\n}\n\n\n/** Calculate the sqrt of a number. num must be &gt;0 otherwise an\nI=\r\nllegalArgumentException is thrown.\n*/\npublic static void sqrt(double num[&gt;0=\r\n]) {\n# ...\n}\n\n/** Handle all IllegalArgumentExceptions occuring on gui inpu=\r\nt */\naspect GUIExceptions {\n    pointcut userInput(gui.** o[instanceof Acti=\r\nonListener]) : target(o) &&\ncall(void ActionListener.actionPerformed(Action=\r\nEvent[.getSource() instanceof\nTextField] ev));\n    after () throwing (Illeg=\r\nalArgumentException e) :userInput(gui.** o) {\n        use dynamicTyping;\n\tw=\r\nith this, JOptionPane showMessageDialog(ev.getSource(), e, localize(&quot;Error\n=\r\nin input&quot;), ERROR_MESSAGE);\n        return;\n    }\n}\n\nType where you want, d=\r\non&#39;t type where you don&#39;t want, use DBC together with\nlist processing, etc.=\r\n, make the language full of features. I know Perl is\ninfamous for its featu=\r\nrism (I really like, no, I love Perl).\nI&#39;d really like such a melting pot o=\r\nf languages (if I&#39;d not need to do some\nnormal work to earn money, I&#39;d desi=\r\ngn such a language). Complete freedom.\nComplete list of features that have =\r\never been into a language. Look at the\ncode above. It uses dynamic typing, =\r\ndeclarative lists, list processing,\ndynamic argument lists and, for design =\r\nby contract, predicates, and it also\nfeatures automatic variables ($_) and =\r\nregular expressions. The last one\ncreates an aspect which handles all Illeg=\r\nalArgumentExceptions thrown in\nActionListeners that are in subpackages of g=\r\nui and invoked from TextFields by\ndisplaying a message dialog and setting t=\r\nhe stack back to normal state\n(return). The with keyword changes the scope =\r\nby adding JOptionPane to the\nlocal scope. The use dynamicTyping prevents th=\r\ne compiler from complaining\nabout incompatible types, during runtime ClassC=\r\nastExceptions may occur if the\ndesired type is not castable and not String.=\r\n (These examples perhaps still\nhave some ambiguity regarding the use and me=\r\naning of predicates). But would\nothers like such a language?\n\n\nI don&#39;t want=\r\n to say DBC alone makes Java code less readable. I just want to\nsay that a =\r\nrich set of features can make a language a rich language as well\nas a *redu=\r\nced* set of features can make a language a rich language. And up to\nnow, th=\r\ne latter was the case with Java. Some want to introduce DBC, some want\nto i=\r\nntroduce AOP, some want to introduce regular expressions, some want to\nintr=\r\noduce dynamic typing, some want to introduce dynamic scoping, some want\nto =\r\nintroduce global variables, some want to introduce dynamic variables, some\n=\r\nwant to introduce configurable scoping, some want to introduce list\nprocess=\r\ning, some want to introduce predicates. But hey, just because Java\ndoesn&#39;t =\r\nhave all these features, it isn&#39;t a bad language.\n\nOf course, now, 8 years =\r\nafter Java was born, it&#39;s easy to say &quot;Java lacks\nthis&quot; and &quot;Java lacks tha=\r\nt&quot;. But Java is dominant, we have to deal with Java\nand the way how it is n=\r\now, we can only use the JCP and external APIs like\nJUnit to improve Java. A=\r\nnd Java isn&#39;t too bad at all.\n\nIf I had to decide wether to add DBC *or* AO=\r\nP to Java, my vote was for AOP,\ndefinitely. DBC is not so important at all,=\r\n it saves much less money than AOP\ncould.\n\n\nBye\n\nP.S.:\nPlease, don&#39;t tell u=\r\ns to purchase iContract ;-)\n- --\nITCQIS GmbH\nChristian Wolfgang Hujer\nGesch=\r\n=E4ftsf=FChrender Gesellschafter\nTelefon: +49  (0)89  27 37 04 37\nTelefax: =\r\n+49  (0)89  27 37 04 39\nE-Mail: Christian.Hujer@...\nWWW: http://www.=\r\nitcqis.com/\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\nVersion: GnuPG v1.0.7 (GNU/Linux)=\r\n\n\niD8DBQE+i0M0zu6h7O/MKZkRAqeSAJ4lP0jYpE3qwEB+5EFklIaxlmV0KQCfSt/2\nET6PgzEq=\r\nlcht4JkaXGlYGJE=3D\n=3Dmvgc\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----\n\n\n",
