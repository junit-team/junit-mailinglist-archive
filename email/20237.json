Perhaps<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; it is worth starting with a class that does not have any collaborators<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; or only ones that are already tested in a previous &quot;test phase&quot;.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  I&#39;d suggest classes which are likely to be worked on &quot;soon&quot;. Those are,<br/>\n&gt;  after all, the ones which you might otherwise break, and for which<br/>\n&gt;  unit tests will add most value.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  It&#39;s tempting to start with &quot;easy&quot; ones, but you run the risk of writing<br/>\n&gt;  tests for things that won&#39;t change and won&#39;t break, and you&#39;d gain an<br/>\n&gt;  unrealistic view of how easy it is(n&#39;t) to add tests post-hoc.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>All good advice.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d also cover the code with end-to-end tests.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnit tests give you a lot of feedback about the internal quality of<br/>\nyour code (is it maintainable, readable, decoupled, cohesive etc.),<br/>\nbut less feedback about the external quality of the code (is it good<br/>\nenough for purpose).<br/>\n<br/>\nEnd-to-end and integration tests give you more feedback about the<br/>\nexternal quality of your code, but less feedback about its internal<br/>\nquality.  E.g. the tell you whether all the pieces work together, but<br/>\nnot whether the pieces are well structured and easily (un)pluggable.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you&#39;ve already got a lot of code, feedback about its internal<br/>\nquality now is a bit late in the day.  I expect you&#39;re concerned about<br/>\nregressions as you add behaviour.  So, I would concentrate on<br/>\nintegration and end-to-end tests to ensure correct system behaviour.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s worth adding unit tests for new classes as you add new behaviour.<br/>\nThey will also help you to discover where the code is difficult to<br/>\nmaintain and help you introduce flex points.  At that point you can<br/>\nstart refactoring the existing code, where it touches the new code, to<br/>\nmake it more testable and more easily surround the refactored with<br/>\nunit tests.  You&#39;ll feel more confident that you aren&#39;t breaking<br/>\nanything because the end-to-end tests will help detect any regressions<br/>\nthe changes cause.<br/>\n<br/>\n--Nat</div>",
