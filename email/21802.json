Unfortunately, at<br/>\nthe time assumptions were released, Eclipse had bad behavior if a test<br/>\nmethod was first started, and then ignored, so I rolled back this<br/>\nchange at the last minute, without updating the documentation.  Please<br/>\nremind me until this is fixed.<br/>\n<br/>\n   David Saff<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Wed, Jul 1, 2009 at 3:12 PM, stefan_lun&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:stefan_lun@...\">stefan_lun@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; Hi!<br/>\n&gt; I read from the documentation that failed assumptions should be reported as ignored test cases but when I&#39;m trying to use them my test cases are passed though failed assumptions.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; In what way should they behave?<br/>\n&gt; In junit code it&#39;s stated as they should pass which I think is incorrect.<br/>\n&gt; See Result.java:testAssumptionFailure.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Could anyone clarify on this please.<br/>\n&gt; /Stefan<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; additional note, I&#39;ve read some posts that assumptions work<br/>\n&gt; in my expected way when used in beforeclass.
