Run a bunch of tests on a class without junit creating a new<br/>\ninstance of the class for each test.  I know you can use the<br/>\nBeforeClass and AfterClass methods to set static data but that is so ugly.<br/>\n<br/>\n2.  It would be nice to have a chain of test where if one failed it<br/>\nwould quit and not run any more.  Maybe this is already available.  If<br/>\nit is please let me know how to do it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks<br/>\nBrian</div>",
