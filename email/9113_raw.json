However its reasonably\nstraightforward to verify that a generated report is correct by manual\nexamination of the text.\n\nIt would be nice to be able to do this once, and store the actual\nresults in a file for verification. On subsequent test runs, the\ngenerated reports could be compared with the previously verified\nreports using asserts.\n\nI&#39;m sure it is possible to write a JUnit extension with a new\nassertSameAsLastTime() method that has two modes of operation: record\nthe results in a file, and compare the results with those in the file.\nThe mode could be controlled by a system property or something. The\nfile would need some sort of structure to associate results with test\ncases and the like.\n\nIf you&#39;ve got any experience, ideas or other opinions about this,\nplease speak up :-)\n\nCheers,\nGraham\n\n\n\n",
