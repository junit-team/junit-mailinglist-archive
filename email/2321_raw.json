Since JUnit uses a custom class loader, and RMI uses \na custom\n&gt; class loader, any class that is loaded by JUnit *and* loaded \nautomatically\n&gt; during a remote call will come from two different class loaders and \nwill\n&gt; fail a class comparison.  It is a bizarre thing, but I have come \naccross it\n&gt; may times when RMI client classes are loaded by any custom \nclassloader.  It\n&gt; happens often with RMI clients that are servlets since servlets are \nusually\n&gt; loaded by the servlet containers&#39; custom class loader.\n&gt; \n&gt; The real solution would be to set the RMIClassLoader&#39;s parent \nclassloader to\n&gt; that of the JUnit custom class loader.  This is not possible \nhowever, so the\n&gt; RMIClassLoader&#39;s parent is *always* the system classloader.  There \nare\n&gt; several bugs logged against the RMI subsystem because of this.\n&gt; \n&gt; In the meantime, the only workaround is to ensure all classes that \nare\n&gt; shared between the server and the custom-class-loaded client are \navailable\n&gt; in the client&#39;s classpath.\n&gt; \n\n\n\n",
