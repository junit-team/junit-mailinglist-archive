In the context of my current\napplication I\n&gt;  &gt; don&#39;t think there would (ever?) be much pain in this process - because\nthese\n&gt;  &gt; objects (in the production code) can not come into existence any other\nway,\n&gt;  &gt; consequently their serialisation/deserialisation code is one of the\nfirst\n&gt;  &gt; things to be tested and is executed pretty thoroughly.  However in\nother\n&gt;  &gt; projects...\n\n&gt;  Almost every problem I have ever had with software has boiled down to \n&gt;  /someone/, /somewhere/ saying, &quot;That&#39;s OK. That&#39;ll /never/ happen.&quot;\n\nIndeed, which was one of the reasons I asked the original question...  &quot;It\nworks okay now, but should I/is there a better way of doing this?&quot;.  Your\nhelpful answer is (as I expected it to be) &quot;Yes, and here&#39;s what it is...&quot;\n\nThank you.  (Thread closed)\n\n",
