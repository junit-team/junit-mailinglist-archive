Does JUnit support this, and if not,\n&gt; would it be hard to add?\n&gt; \n\nI am developing a tool called Joshua that facilitates the distributed execution\nof test suites that adhere to the JUnit testing framework.  There is \ncurrently no public version of the tool.  However, I am working on a public \nversion that will utilize the newest versions of Jini, JavaSpaces, JNLP, and \nthe newest JUnit 3.6.  You can read a paper that I have published \nat the International Conference and Exposition on Testing Computer Software \n(TCS 2001) that discusses Joshua.  I was specifically addressing the issue\nof regression testing since my industry experience found the largest test\nsuites were created over time by this type of testing.  You can find more\ninformation at the following links:\n\nJoshua Main Site (developing, but still somewhat bare):\n\nhttp://cs.allegheny.edu/~gkapfham/research/joshua/index.html\n\n&quot;Automatically and Transparently Distributing the Execution of Regression\nTest Suites&quot; (among other papers):\n\nhttp://cs.allegheny.edu/~gkapfham/research/publish/index.html\n\nWhat is your schedule for needing a tool that supports the distributed \nexecution of test suites?  Would you be willing to contribute your application \nand its tests for an empirical analysis that I am conducting?  Do you have \ndevelopers that are interested in contributing to the creation of Joshua?\n\n[Incidentally, I have not used the ActiveTestSuite, but from reading the\nJavaDoc, I can see that Joshua goes past what this class provides.  The tool\noffers the ability to execute the test suite on multiple machines instead of\njust multiple threads on the same machine.  However, the idea is conceptually\nthe same.  I think that distribution across multiple machines could yield\nmore cost effectiveness, depending on the computation/communication ratio that\nyour test suites exhibit.]\n\ngreg\n\n-- \nGregory M.
