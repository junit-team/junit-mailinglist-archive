B. Rainsberger wrote:\n\n&gt; I find it difficult not to interpret this as a (very mild) personal \n&gt; attack. You seem to imply that we are not also practitioners. I suspect \n&gt; you&#39;re not an asshole, so I imagine you mean something else. I would \n&gt; appreciate you clarifying this position. Is it necessarily the case, \n&gt; then, that &quot;the sort of programmers who... hang out on lists like this \n&gt; one&quot; don&#39;t know what we&#39;re talking about, because I kinda think I do and \n&gt; I kinda think I&#39;ve proven that.\n\nYou do know what you&#39;re talking about, and you are practitioners, as am \nI. However you&#39;re making the classic mistake of assuming that everyone \nelse is just like you, and that what works for you works for them. This \nis a *HUGE* and unrecognized fallacy that underlies a lot more than \nprogramming methodologies. For instance, it&#39;s largely responsible for \nthe failure of modern elementary and secondary education, which works \nfor maybe 5% of children. However that&#39;s those 5% that go onto become \nteachers and principles and propagate the same techniques to future \ngenerations, while ignoring the failure of 95% of their students.\n\nThe simple fact is that people learn and think differently. No one \ntechnique works for everyone, but some techniques do work for more \npeople. We tend to self-select into groups that think similarly and \nlearn similarly to ourselves. The people who like interfaces are a \nself-selected group of programmers who think at a very high degree of \nabstraction, even for programmers (already a self-selected and abstract \nbunch). This doesn&#39;t mean they don&#39;t produce quality software. It does \nmean that you can&#39;t expect what works for them to work for all or even \nmost developers.\n\n-- \n﻿Elliotte Rusty Harold  elharo@...\nJava I/O 2nd Edition Just Published!\nhttp://www.cafeaulait.org/books/javaio2/\nhttp://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0596527500/ref=nosim/cafeaulaitA/\n\n",
