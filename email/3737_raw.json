That would be easier to express in a (programming language-based)\ntest case. Then you should pick a few (a very small number, if\npossible) test images to eye-ball now and then to double check that\nnothing&#39;s gone wrong.\n\nRemember: you just need to test the mapping somehow; it doesn&#39;t have to\nuse the images as input/output.\n\n*********** REPLY SEPARATOR ***********\n\nOn 1/9/2002 at 9:39 AM David V.
