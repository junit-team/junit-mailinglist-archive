I certainly can attest to the experience as\nwell!  I don&#39;t think I spend 70% of my time in testing, but it may be\nclose.  The problem I have in estimating the amount of time I am writing\ntest code is that I am constantly switching back and forth between tests\nand production.  Tests are more than tests to me, they turn out to be my\ndesign phase as well (as many others will testify of themselves).  So,\nhow much time do you spend on design?\n\nWhat would be interesting, and I would be willing to participate, is\ngiven a smallish (but non-trivial) project, let&#39;s do an alpha release:\nsomeone try it without TDD (and perhaps without tests -- eeek!!) and I\nwill do with TDD.  Who gets done in the shortest amount of time?  Who&#39;s\ncode is &#39;better&#39; (more maintainable, fewer bugs, etc.)?  Who fulfills\nall of the requirements?  You get the picture.  I wager that I would\nwin. ;)\n\n=jason\n\nOn Tue, 2003-04-08 at 16:27, javainsel wrote: &gt; Actually, I find that\nI&#39;m spending even *larger* amounts of time \nworking \n&gt; with my tests.
