This may\nserver as a good baseline to generate tests on top of.\n\nAlso Ecore (The EMF Meta Modeling Framework) is useful\nfor thinking about the Semantics of Java and object\noriented structure.\n\nFor example an EAttribrute is used to model primitives\nin Java, as well as Strings.\n\nSo if you start with models of what Java lets you do,\nyou can use those models to Enumerate all\npossibilities and generate tests that test the\nexpectations around what is to be returned by method\ncalls and recommend various model invarient\nconstraints that would give feedback on illegal values\nthat would produce unwanted results.\n\nAlternatively if you use Java&#39;s Reflection\ncapabilities  that should get you a long ways as well.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n--- Kevin Lawrence &lt;kev.lawrence@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt; On 12/27/06, junitheadache\n&gt; &lt;bohs01@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Hi all,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I am currently working on auto generation of test\n&gt; cases for TDD for\n&gt; &gt; my honors year project. And was considering\n&gt; modifying JUnit such\n&gt; &gt; that it will auto generate some test cases based\n&gt; values flagged by\n&gt; &gt; users.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; E.g.,\n&gt; &gt; Public boolean isLegalInt(int x){\n&gt; &gt; /* input - 0 &lt; x &lt; 10, result - True*/\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; }\n&gt; &gt; given a comment like the above will generate\n&gt; assert statements such\n&gt; &gt; as\n&gt; &gt; assertFalse(isLegalInt(0));\n&gt; &gt; assertTrue(isLegalInt(1));\n&gt; &gt; assertTrue(isLegalInt(9));\n&gt; &gt; assertFalse(isLegalInt(10));\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Hi Junitheadache,\n&gt; \n&gt; You should read David Saff&#39;s recent post on this\n&gt; list about &quot;The\n&gt; Practice of Theories&quot;.\n&gt; \n&gt; David proposes an extension to JUnit that would\n&gt; allow programmers to\n&gt; create DbC-like tests that would apply to *all*\n&gt; parameters to a\n&gt; method, for example:\n&gt; \n&gt; @Theory public void multiplyIsInverseOfDivide(Money\n&gt; amount, int multiplier) {\n&gt; assertEquals(amount,\n&gt; amount.times(multiplier).divideBy(multiplier));\n&gt; }\n&gt; \n&gt; A specialized test-runner would then behave as a\n&gt; kind of &quot;theorem\n&gt; disprover&quot; and look for counter-examples that cause\n&gt; the assertion to\n&gt; fail. There is way more to it than this simple\n&gt; example - read the\n&gt; paper at\n&gt;\nhttp://shareandenjoy.saff.net/2006/12/new-paper-practice-of-theories.html\n&gt; \n&gt; Note that this is not exactly TDD - it is more of a\n&gt; specification and\n&gt; testing tool than a design tool - but it could be a\n&gt; very nice\n&gt; complement to TDD to document /general rules/ rather\n&gt; than /specific\n&gt; examples/ .\n&gt; \n&gt; See also my blog about &quot;For all vs There Exists&quot;\n&gt; thinking at\n&gt;\nhttp://www.developertesting.com/archives/month200604/20060413-ForAllVsThereExists.html\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Note that David&#39;s approach does not actually\n&gt; generate code in the way\n&gt; that you are suggesting. But it could, for example,\n&gt; generate specific\n&gt; tests to illustrate the cases where the theory does\n&gt; not hold.\n&gt; \n&gt; Kevin\n&gt; \n&gt; www.junitfactory.com\n&gt; You send us code.
