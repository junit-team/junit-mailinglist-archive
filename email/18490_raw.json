I understand where you&#39;re coming fr=\r\nom.\n\n&gt; I find that I end up with very few tests that actually want to say\n&gt;=\r\n    assertTrue( 2 &lt; n && n &lt; 10, &quot;n should be inside the (2, 10) interval&quot;)=\r\n;\n\nAgreed.\n\n&gt; &gt; So, I don&#39;t usually bother with assertion failure messages.=\r\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Out of true curiosity, to what extent is this because you&#39;re already\n&gt;=\r\n using the built-in assertion failure sugar in assertEquals?\n\nCorrect, I&#39;m =\r\nusually employing assertEquals. I&#39;d say out of the small  \npercentage of as=\r\nsertions where I&#39;m *not* using assertEquals, I feel  \ncompelled to annotate=\r\n less than one out of five of those. Same reason:  \nit&#39;s more effort than I=\r\n feel compelled to do at the time, so I wait  \nuntil I need to add it (i.e.=\r\n when a test breaks post-development).\n\nIf what you&#39;re suggesting is that m=\r\nost of my assertions will be as  \nsimple and readable as:\n   assertThat(x, =\r\neq(5));\nyou&#39;re right. It&#39;s the 80-20 rule, and I guess my take is that I&#39;m =\r\n \nhappy enough to write custom assert methods for my 20% rather than to  \nt=\r\nry and build/use a framework that deals with every possibility. (The  \nothe=\r\nr thought would be to punt, not using the framework when things  \ngot too u=\r\ngly, but that sort of inconsistent solutions seems to make  \nthings even ha=\r\nrder to follow.)\n\nI experimented with one of the frameworks a good while ag=\r\no. Still, I&#39;d  \nbe happy to give a more recent version a try. Can you re-po=\r\nst a link  \nto one you recommend?\n\nMany thanks,\nJeff\n\n----\nDavid Saff said.=\r\n..\n\nThanks for a thoughtful message.  I&#39;ll try to be fair to your\npoints--t=\r\nhis is not something that I feel is immensely important to\nget agreement on=\r\n, but I&#39;m hoping to help those who haven&#39;t tried\nassertThat to get a feelin=\r\ng for it&#39;s power, perhaps just enough of a\nglimpse that they&#39;ll try it, and=\r\n see how it goes.  (Any apostate\nassertThat users out there?  Tried it, hat=\r\ned it, gone back?)\n\n...\n\n",
