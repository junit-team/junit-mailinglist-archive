I want a know set of directories and files (and for a backup tool the dates).  I don&#39;t see the value in setup/teardown for each unit test.  This assumes the tool/tests do not change the setup.\r\n\r\nThe only problem was &quot;tricking&quot; junit to allow this.  I could have done this in ant but sometimes, during developement I use jedit and junit and not ant.\r\n\r\nI would like junit to support a onetime setup/teardown for some types of tools, although it is possible I would get lazy and use in when I shouldn&#39;t.\r\n\r\njeb\n\n_______________________________________________\nCan a Web portal forever change your life?\nWin up to $25 Million on iWon - http://www.iwon.com\n\n",
