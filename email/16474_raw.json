I =\r\nrealize that handing the control to CVS about a test being\nwritten or not (=\r\nthat&#39;s essentially what I was proposing) is a bad\nidea. Especially the effe=\r\nct on developers can&#39;t be underestimated as\nit seems. Writing tests should =\r\nbe a help and not a boring task.\n\nAbout Ant and JUnit: I setup a small exam=\r\nple with Ant running JUnit\ntests and noticed that it&#39;s generally possible t=\r\no select the tests I&#39;d\nlike to run via Ant (nothing special about it), the =\r\ndownside being the\nnecessity to alter the build file every time which is a =\r\nbad idea. The\ndefault option is to run all existing tests, of course, but c=\r\nertain\nsituations demand partial test execution only. Is there a way to do\n=\r\nthis without messing without Ant&#39;s build file? I was thinking of\nsomething =\r\nsimiliar like TestNG&#39;s feature of grouping tests by name,\nbut it should wor=\r\nk without Java 5\n\nRegards,\n\nMaik\n\n--- In junit@yahoogroups.com, &quot;J.

I do\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; know that it&#39;s possible to include JUnit tasks in =\r\nAnt&#39;s build.xml, but\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m looking for a way\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; to make JUnit tests=\r\n mandatory for every piece of code that&#39;s written\n&gt; &gt; and commited to our\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; \n&gt; &gt; CVS.\n&gt; \n&gt; Even if there is a technical solution to this &quot;problem&quot;, =\r\nI would never \n&gt; use it. It assumes that 100% of code needs to be tested. W=\r\nhile this \n&gt; might be a good goal, experience shows that it is not practica=\r\nl. No \n&gt; machine can judge whether a given test is worth writing; only huma=\r\nns\ncan \n&gt; do that.\n&gt; \n&gt; Also, if people write tests only because some machi=\r\nne tells them to,\nyou \n&gt; probably won&#39;t see high quality tests.\n&gt; -- \n&gt; J. =\r\nB.
