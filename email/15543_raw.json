So, I have modified test=\r\nA, which directly tests classA, but \n&gt; don&#39;t realize that I have broken som=\r\nething in testC.  My solution is\n&gt; that we run nightlybuilds, and I check t=\r\nhe errors/failures the next \n&gt; morning to see if my code changes could have=\r\n caused any of them.\n&gt; \n&gt; It would be nice to be a little more proactive, t=\r\nhough,...being able\n&gt; to (easily) find all the tests that are ultimately af=\r\nfected by my \n&gt; code change (iterating through the workspace references unt=\r\nil I \n&gt; terminate at all classes that start with &quot;Test&quot;, or that are in my =\r\n\n&gt; test branch).  I know that I can do this manually through Eclipse, \n&gt; bu=\r\nt it is not fun - and therefore doesn&#39;t get done.\n\nHow long does it take to=\r\n run all your tests? That would be the obvious\nfirst answer, I&#39;d suggest.\n\n=\r\nAlso, if you try to make your tests only test a single unit, that\nhelps a l=\r\not - and using mock objects helps there (I use EasyMock\nmyself). It certain=\r\nly doesn&#39;t solve the problem 100%, but it&#39;s a good\nstart.\n\nJon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
