Yes, I understand why the methods have to be static.  I&#39;m \njust looking for a way around that requirement, since all of the \nmethods that I want to call within oneTimeSetup() and oneTimeTearDown\n() are *not* static and are existing castor framework code to build \nup and delete data for my test cases.  I just want to call this \npretty significant setup and tear down code just once and use it for \nall of my test cases verses for every testXXX() method via the \nregular setup() and tearDown() methods.  \n\nWhat do you mean by &quot;you can always create a singleton&quot;?\n\nthanks,\nchad.\n\n--- In junit@y..., Shane Duan &lt;sduan@b...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; The reason that they are static is because they need to be called \nby \n&gt; &#39;suite()&#39; method, which is a static.  If you need to call other \nmethod \n&gt; from oneTimeSetup, my hunch is that either those method should be \nstatic \n&gt; as well.  If that is not the case, then you can always create a \nsingleton.\n&gt; \n\n\n\nTo unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\njunit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n \n\nYour use of Yahoo!
