We use Mock objects, so that helps,...but we don&#39;t use them everywhere.  We also utilize &quot;TestAll&quot; tests, so that helps get you to a scope somewhere between one and all.\n\nWe don&#39;t run into this often,...but it does happen, and I have asked myself &quot;Isn&#39;t there an easier way to find all the tests that might be affected by my change?&quot;\n\n-------------- Original message -------------- \n--- In junit@yahoogroups.com, didoss@c... wrote:\n&gt; My problem is usually along the lines of: I make changes to classA, \n&gt; which is used in classB, which is used in classC, which is tested by\n&gt; testC.  So, I have modified testA, which directly tests classA, but \n&gt; don&#39;t realize that I have broken something in testC.  My solution is\n&gt; that we run nightlybuilds, and I check the errors/failures the next \n&gt; morning to see if my code changes could have caused any of them.\n&gt; \n&gt; It would be nice to be a little more proactive, though,...being able\n&gt; to (easily) find all the tests that are ultimately affected by my \n&gt; code change (iterating through the workspace references until I \n&gt; terminate at all classes that start with &quot;Test&quot;, or that are in my \n&gt; test branch).  I know that I can do this manually through Eclipse, \n&gt; but it is not fun - and therefore doesn&#39;t get done.\n\nHow long does it take to run all your tests? That would be the obvious\nfirst answer, I&#39;d suggest.\n\nAlso, if you try to make your tests only test a single unit, that\nhelps a lot - and using mock objects helps there (I use EasyMock\nmyself). It certainly doesn&#39;t solve the problem 100%, but it&#39;s a good\nstart.\n\nJon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSPONSORED LINKS Basic programming language C programming language Computer programming languages \nThe c programming language C programming language List of programming languages \n\n\n\nYAHOO!
