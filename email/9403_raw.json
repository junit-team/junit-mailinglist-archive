I accept all the good points made about using assertions in\nunit tests. But the point I was making about logging was echoing this\nsentiment:\n\n&quot;Logging equips the developer with detailed context for application\nfailures. On the other hand, testing provides quality assurance and\nconfidence in the application. Logging and testing should not be\nconfused. They are complementary. When logging is wisely used, it can\nprove to be an essential tool.&quot;\nhttp://jakarta.apache.org/log4j/docs/index.html\n\nI adopted log4j about three years ago, in which time I&#39;ve developed a\nlot of code that has log4j logging in it. I&#39;ve written a lot of tests\nin that time as well, and have used log4j in tests sometimes,\nespecially when the setUp() methods get a little complicated. \n\nFor example, when there&#39;s a lot of output in the logs coming from the\ncode, it helps to mark where a setUp() method ends and a test begins.\nCertainly in properly isolated unit tests there is not much need for\nlogging anywhere. (In my experience in the field, there are plenty of\nJUnit &#39;unit&#39; tests out there that do not qualify as properly isolated\nunit tests). But I don&#39;t have a problem with complex tests and test\nharnesses that log when they need to, what holds for code is true for\ntests. For unit tests, I totally accept the superiority of assertions.\nFor other kinds of tests, I think logging can provide additional\ncomplementary information that can save time finding out why the\nfailing test failed.\n\nMalcolm\n\n\nOn Thu, 2003-09-18 at 07:59, John L. Webber - Jentro AG wrote:\n&gt; I found this thread interesting and helpful, because it forced me to \n&gt; check my premises:\n&gt; \n&gt; I occasionally insert temporary System.out.println statements when \n&gt; debugging a single test case (usually during a refactoring that caused \n&gt; the test case to break) and don&#39;t see a great problem with this. \n&gt; Nonetheless, J.B.  and Vladimir have convinced me that it would be \n&gt; better to use additional assertions in such situations. Guess I need to \n&gt; delve into the javadocs more to discover all the additional assert \n&gt; methods JUnit makes available... :-)\n&gt; \n&gt; John\n&gt; \n&gt; J.B. Rainsberger wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;If a test fails, then you are making an assumption that does not hold \n&gt; &gt;true, either about the test or the production code you are testing. Add \n&gt; &gt;more assertions.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; This sounds like a good habit to get into!\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;If I cannot pass a test right away, I throw away my production code and \n&gt; &gt;try again. If I&#39;m wrong twice in a row, I might throw the test away and \n&gt; &gt;try to write it again. Typically (according to my experience) that&#39;s \n&gt; &gt;faster than doing all this diagnostic stuff.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; It&#39;s sooo easy and seductive to keep diagnosing and diagnosing...\n-- \nDirector\nCongreve Computing Ltd.\n\n\n",
