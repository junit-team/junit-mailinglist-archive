Should test<br/>\n&gt; scenarios for A or B cover what may happen in C ? If so, is it just<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I suspect that the method signatures on A(), B() and C() have been left<br/>\nout for brevity. I don&#39;t know of any good answer to as general a<br/>\nsituation as this. Does C() actually take no parameters, and changes<br/>\nstate of the class, or does C() get passed in the same kind of<br/>\nparameters from A() and B()? In the former case, maybe it does need to<br/>\nbe a private method. In the latter, might C() be pulled out as a public<br/>\nmethod into a helper class?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; If you use TDD would you ever end up with private methods, declaring<br/>\n </span></blockquote>them<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; as protected instead?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>IMHO, it doesn&#39;t make sense to make private methods protected simply to<br/>\ntest them. &quot;protected&quot; has a specific purpose in the language, and<br/>\nunless you are expecting people to write subclasses and override those<br/>\nmethods, they probably shouldn&#39;t become protected...<br/>\n<br/>\nJust my 2 cents...<br/>\n<br/>\nRegards,<br/>\nNilesh</div>",
