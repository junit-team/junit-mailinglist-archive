The <br/>\n&gt; constructor of each test instance is called just before @Before.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; So my question - is this a designed behaviour? Can I assume that junit 4 runners will have <br/>\n&gt; this behaviour, allowing me to use the constructor instead of @Before, allowing fields to <br/>\n&gt; be final, etc? <br/>\n&gt;   <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yes, this is designed behavior (as is, in your second message, releasing <br/>\neach test object for potential garbage collection after the test <br/>\ncompletes).  You can trust the runners that ship with JUnit 4 to <br/>\npreserve it.  If you invoke a custom runner, you&#39;re currently at the <br/>\nmercy of that runner&#39;s writer.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn my own code, I use constructors in JUnit 4 tests, unless I&#39;m doing <br/>\nsomething that I want to be visually matched with a particular @After.<br/>\n<br/>\nShare and Enjoy,<br/>\n<br/>\n    David Saff</div>",
