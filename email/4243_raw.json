I&#39;ve used both techniques successfully.\n\n&gt; &gt; In other words, if I went with the new TestCase extension route, I&#39;m not sure\n&gt; &gt; whether I&#39;ll remember 6 months down the road that I created the new \nTestCase\n&gt; &gt; class to hold the custom assertions. Where as making calls to an specialized\n&gt; &gt; Assert class route would likely to be more understandable.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Perhaps, if you remembered that the specialized Assert class existed.\n\nGood point! If I&#39;m not using that new specialized Assert class often enough I can \nsee myself forgetting about it&#39;s existence. As to which would be more \ntroublesome when forgotten (a new specialized Assert or a new common \nTestCase base class) it&#39;s hard to say.\n\n&gt; &gt; What are your thoughts on the matter of simplicity and readability vs. ease \nof\n&gt; &gt; initial implementation with regards to these choices? I&#39;m trying to stick to \nthe\n&gt; &gt; Extreme Programming way of doing things.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Do what&#39;s simplest for you today, then refactor it later if you change your \nmind.\n&gt; Test code can begin to smell just as production code sometimes does.  \nRefactoring is\n&gt; the cure.\n&gt; \n&gt; Mike\n\n\n--- In junit@y..., Vladimir Bossicard &lt;vladimir@b...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; I definitively stick with my approach even if it&#39;s maybe not the \n&gt; &quot;Simplest thing which could possibly work&quot;.  But it&#39;s maybe because I \n&gt; don&#39;t stick to this principle.\n&gt; \n&gt; In many cases, the simplest thing that works is #ifdef ... #endif (in \n&gt; C++).  Well I let you imagine how a code may look like after several \n&gt; years of #ifdef... #endif!\n\nI guess the question is what is simple?\n\nEasy to implement now or simple to understand? They&#39;re not necessarily the \nsame thing.\n\nIt can come down to making a choice between the two. I suppose in those cases \nthe best thing to do at the moment is whatever hurts the least. At a certain \nlevel what&#39;s simplest to implement becomes harder to comprehend.\n\nPerhaps a three stage refactoring should occur when one feels the urge to \ncreate a new specialized Assert class for one&#39;s new custom assert \nresponsibilities.\n\n1. First keep the custom assert methods local to your test cases.\n\n2. When excessive duplication starts to occur push these responsibilities up into \na new specialized Test Case base class and sub-class your individual unit test \ncases from that.\n\n3. When these assert methods have proven their usefulness and durability over \na period of time refactor them out into a new specialized sub-class Assert class \n(and get rid of the specialized TestCase class) in order to make one&#39;s test code \na little easier to understand. Or shift these responsibilities to a new sub-class \nAssert class when other unrelated tests cases could make use of them.\n\nIn other words, have these new custom assert methods evolve into a new \nspecialized Assert sub-class over a series of refactorings. Following the &quot;You \nAren&#39;t Gonna Need It&quot; principle.\n\nThanks for your advice,\n\nAnthony\n\n\n\n\n",
