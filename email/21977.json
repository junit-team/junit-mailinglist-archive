I might, for example, want to have the errorCode not as a an int, but as a String, or as an enumeration item. I might also have multiple error codes, a major one and a minor one, and so on. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Therefore it is very unlikely that this change will get to the sources.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; There is a mail sent by David Saff on 20th of Oct, regarding the feature prioritization on JUnit.

Just replacing the jar within the junit plugins folder will crash eclipse since it recognizes the change...<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Any ideas?<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Maybe this enhancement could be fed back to the junit sources?<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Thanks,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Remo<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>",
