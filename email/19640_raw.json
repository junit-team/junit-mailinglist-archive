(which is on topic.)\n&gt; \n&gt; The usual suggestions for rewriting the code are offered, such as using \n&gt; a factory class to allocate/create objects, and always always just \n&gt; returning the one and only.\n\nI haven&#39;t seen that suggestion all too often. And I agree that it&#39;s not \na big advantage over a true Singleton (if I understand you correctly). \nThere still is a small improvement, though: the class itself isn&#39;t \ncoupled any longer to its singletoness, so it becomes easier to reuse.\n\nPersonally, I typically prefer the Just Create One pattern: \nhttp://butunclebob.com/ArticleS.UncleBob.SingletonVsJustCreateOne\n\n\n&gt; p.s. any hints of forums/lists where this topic could be explored would \n&gt; be greatly appreciated. I&#39;ve found lots of places where rookies can ask \n&gt; how to use a HashMap, and lots where folks argue about JSRs, but I&#39;m \n&gt; really looking for somewhere where professional, experienced Java \n&gt; developers can get answers to hard questions.\n\nI highly recommend JavaRanch.com. Although it&#39;s originally targeted at \ngreenhorns, we also have a lot of veterans discussing advanced topics \nthere, especially in the OO forum where your question would be most \nwelcome: \nhttp://saloon.javaranch.com/cgi-bin/ubb/ultimatebb.cgi?ubb=forum&f=9\n\n(In fact you might want to do a search first, because we discuss the \nSingleton pattern quite regularly...)\n\nDisclaimer: I&#39;m a Sheriff (Administrator) at JavaRanch, so I&#39;m hardly \nobjective.\n\nCheers, Ilja\n\n",
