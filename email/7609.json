If the client is a remote object, then the server will <br/>\nencounter a RemoteException as soon as it tries to use something from <br/>\nthe clients remote interface*.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf the client is _not_ a remote object, then RMI provides pass by value <br/>\nsemantics. In other words, the server jvm gets its own copy of the <br/>\nclient object & the life-cycle of the original client object is <br/>\nunimportant.<br/>\n<br/>\nRMI supports/manages distributed GC. If both sides no longer reference <br/>\nan object, then that object is eligble for GC. Moreover, distributed GC <br/>\nrules == local GC rules. The only caveat I experienced in the <br/>\ndistributed scenario is that the naming service holds a reference to my <br/>\nserver object indefinitely. In most cases, this is probably a benefit. <br/>\n(ie. you don&#39;t want your remote object/server GC&#39;d when clients are <br/>\nexpecting to use it.)<br/>\n<br/>\n-- Levi<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n* In my experiments toString(), equals(), and hashcode() are always <br/>\ncallable. These messages are serviced by the Client_Stub & don&#39;t lead <br/>\nto remote communication.<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",
