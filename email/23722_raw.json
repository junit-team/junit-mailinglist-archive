My understanding o=\r\nf our existing test infrastructure was not sufficient enough and in my init=\r\nial post I&#39;ve provided a somewhat inaccurate description of the problem I&#39;m=\r\n trying to address.\n\nThe AbstractNutchTest is in full use and does an excel=\r\nlent job of extending TestCase to provide a platform for many other tests t=\r\no build from. The test case I have identified as being pretty hectic is Tes=\r\ntGoraStorage [1]. The initial thing I found puzzling about this test case i=\r\ns that, if run as a java application without any arguments, it passes a usa=\r\nge message &quot;Usage: TestGoraStore &lt;id&gt; &lt;startKey&gt; &lt;numRecords&gt;&quot;. I&#39;ve never =\r\nexperienced anything like this is any previous JUnit test cases, can anyone=\r\n explain this to me please?\n\nThe errors I&#39;m getting when I run the test cla=\r\nss can be seen here [2].\n\nI understand that the errors might not be JUnit s=\r\npecific, however if I was able to get a bit of guidance as to the nature of=\r\n the test etc then it would be more than helpful.\n\nThank you\n\nLewis\n\n[1] ht=\r\ntps://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/nutch/branches/nutchgora/src/test/org/apache=\r\n/nutch/storage/TestGoraStorage.java \n[2] https://issues.apache.org/jira/bro=\r\nwse/NUTCH-1135\n\n--- In junit@yahoogroups.com, &quot;lewismc2&quot; &lt;lewis.mcgibbney@.=\r\n..&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi list,\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m attempting to overhaul our test source as =\r\nper this Jira issue [1] and sub-issues. When looking at one existing test c=\r\nlass [2] I see that instead of extending TestCase the case extends Abstract=\r\nNutchTest. Apart from my initial thoughts that this was a previously used t=\r\nesting mechanism, I am pretty convinced that this has now been deprecated i=\r\nn favour of JUnit 4.5 test cases. This can also be seen in [3], which you w=\r\nill notice is also failing as documented in [1].\n&gt; \n&gt; Further to this, I no=\r\ntice that there are a number of parameters that cannot be resolved e.g. in =\r\nthe case of TestInjector, testDir as shown below. This is consistent across=\r\n &#39;all&#39; four of the test cases I am trying to fix. I wonder if anyone can po=\r\nint me in the right direction to getting the configuration correct and gett=\r\ning these test cases working again.\n&gt; \n&gt; {code}\n&gt; lewis@lewis-01:~/ASF/nutc=\r\nhgora/runtime/local$ bin/nutch junit org.apache.nutch.crawl.TestInjector\n&gt; =\r\n.E\n&gt; Time: 0.003\n&gt; There was 1 error:\n&gt; 1) testInject(org.apache.nutch.craw=\r\nl.TestInjector)java.lang.Error: Unresolved compilation problem: \n&gt; \ttestdir=\r\n cannot be resolved\n&gt; \n&gt; \tat org.apache.nutch.crawl.TestInjector.setUp(Test=\r\nInjector.java:57)\n&gt; \n&gt; FAILURES!!!\n&gt; Tests run: 1,  Failures: 0,  Errors: 1=\r\n\n&gt; {code}\n&gt; \n&gt; [1] https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NUTCH-1081\n&gt; [2] h=\r\nttps://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/nutch/branches/nutchbase/src/test/org/apach=\r\ne/nutch/crawl/TestInjector.java\n&gt; [3] https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/nutc=\r\nh/branches/nutchbase/src/test/org/apache/nutch/crawl/TestGenerator.java\n&gt;\n\n=\r\n\n\n",
