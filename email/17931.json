I have to remember that<br/>\nto see if I agree that it is the magic formula for simplicity.<br/>\n<br/>\nI do think that simple is often mistaken for easy. Simple is usually easy if<br/>\nyou know the tools. If you have to learn the tools to achieve simple then<br/>\nsomething /less simple/ may be /easier/<br/>\n(in the example I posted, though it was not a very good one, I think<br/>\neveryone who took the programming 101 knows how to create a swith statement.<br/>\nComing up with something command-like would be less /easy/ but perhaps more<br/>\nsimple. This discussion would have been /simpler/ with a better and more<br/>\nrelevant example but I took the /easy/ way out and wrote the first thing<br/>\nthat came to my mind :)).<br/>\n<br/>\n/J<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On 8/20/06, J.

Start with &quot;fewer lines of code&quot; as a measure of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; simplicity. When you get to the first counterexample, add the next<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ingredient...<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Thank you for your comment,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Are you talking about total lines of code or lines of code in one<br/>\n&gt; &gt; place?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I mean lines of code (not of declarations) involved in adding the<br/>\n&gt; feature. Using this measure, the command design requires fewer lines.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Another measure of simplicity is the number of algorithms that have to<br/>\n&gt; change or be created. In the case of the switch statement, we have to<br/>\n&gt; change 1 algorithm (the switch) and create 1 algorithm (the<br/>\n&gt; implementation of the new command-like thing). In the case of the<br/>\n&gt; command design, we only have to create 1 algorithm (the implementation<br/>\n&gt; of the new command) and we don&#39;t need to change any other algorithm.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Or something, I have my preference but I don&#39;t know if it is the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; simple one in everyones book. I think it can become more complicated<br/>\n&gt; &gt; than just counting lines fo code to know what is simple but I agree<br/>\n&gt; &gt; that it is a good start.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; When counting lines of code for this purpose, I tend only to count the<br/>\n&gt; bodies of methods and exclude lines that only declare variables.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --<br/>\n&gt; J.
