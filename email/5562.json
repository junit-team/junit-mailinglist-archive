Following <br/>\nalong at: <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://dev.eclipse.org/viewcvs/index.cgi/%7Echeckout%7E/jdt-ui-\">http://dev.eclipse.org/viewcvs/index.cgi/%7Echeckout%7E/jdt-ui-</a><br/>\nhome/plugins/org.eclipse.jdt.junit/index.html<br/>\nit looked like I should just have to download and install the <br/>\norg.eclipse.pde.junit plugin and I should be able to run plugin tests.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter installing that, the Run As-&gt;Junit Workbench is not available. <br/>\nThere is a Run As -&gt; Junit Plugin Test, but when ever I point that at <br/>\nmy test cases it seems to work for a few seconds then nothing <br/>\nhappens. If I look at the debug perspective I do see a new terminated <br/>\nJavaw.exe, so it looks like it tried to do something, but I have <br/>\nnothing on the console, and the Junit view is blank other then under <br/>\nFailure Trace which says &quot;Launching TestRunner&quot;.  There does not seem <br/>\nto be anything in the .log file either.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs a note, if I select the project that contains all the tests, and <br/>\ndo a Run As-&gt; Junit Plugin Test, it will find my test cases, but when <br/>\nI select the test I want to run, it does the same as above.  If I <br/>\njust do a Run as -&gt; Junit Test, then I can at least run simple tests.<br/>\n<br/>\nAny ideas as to what I may be doing wrong? Any information I missed <br/>\nposting that may help solve this?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks, <br/>\n  -Peter</div>",
