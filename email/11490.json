I bought the<br/>\nebook edition some days ago, and I&#39;ve already begun to apply what I&#39;ve<br/>\nlearned.  My unit tests (Programmer Tests) are simpler and clearer.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe material on organizing tests presents multiple points of view, offers<br/>\nthe authors&#39; own preferences and their reasons for having them based on<br/>\nthose points of view.  It&#39;s very practical.  Of course, J.B. is very<br/>\npractical, evidenced by his replies in this group and having met him once at<br/>\nXP/AU 2002 in Chicago.<br/>\n<br/>\nNice work J.B. and Scott!<br/>\n<br/>\nCraig Demyanovich</div>",
