The conformity that I&#39;m\n&gt; trying to enforce is not via the interface.  I will be using reflection and\n&gt; perhaps xjavadoc to enforce some custom rules regarding annotation tags,\n&gt; internal structure, etc...\n&gt; \n&gt; I was able to solve my problem by creating my own TestSuite class that\n&gt; implements Test.  I added a constructor and appropriate logic to allow my\n&gt; code to pass in a custom constructor to use instead of the no-arg or String\n&gt; name args that the original TestSuite used to fire up the Tests.\n&gt; \n&gt; protected MyTestSuite(final Class theClass, Class[] constructorArgClasses,\n&gt; Object[] constructorArgs) ...\n&gt; \n&gt; My suite now looks like this:\n&gt; \n&gt;         suite.addTestSuite(TestRule1.class, new Class[] {Class.class}, new\n&gt; Object[] {ClassToTest.class});\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; I understand that this is a hack, but it allows me to proceed.  If you would\n&gt; like more information regarding my changes, let me know.  I don&#39;t think this\n&gt; is worthy of submitting as a patch/change request.  If you can think of a\n&gt; better way to handle custom constructors, please let me know.\n\nI think what you&#39;re doing is quite close to the Parameterized Test Case \npattern, so you&#39;re no less hacking than I was. As for being worthy of a \npatch, probably not. This is one of those local customizations that just \nisn&#39;t common enough to be part of the framework. (Not that my opinion \nmatters--I&#39;m just a user, too.)\n\nTake care.\n-- \nJ. B.
