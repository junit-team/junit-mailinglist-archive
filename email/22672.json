I would expect it to be something more<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; than a way of avoiding that kind of boilerplate.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; I just explained that in my previous reply. When the boilerplate that is<br/>\n&gt;&gt; avoided is so excessive, the syntactic sugar itself becomes a valuable<br/>\n&gt;&gt; feature.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I really don&#39;t perceive that as excessive boilerplate. YMMV.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; As an example of the kind of thing I think a class rule would enable,<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; is that it might allow the rule to dynamically pass values to the<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; test class&#39;s constructor based on some dynamic criteria (say a souped<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; up version of Parameterized)<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; No. Test class instantiation occurs per-method, not per-class, thus<br/>\n&gt;&gt; class-level is not where it can be changed.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Test instantiation is yes, but I would expect a ClassRule to provide a hook into the instance generation process (although for the whole class, not each case at a time).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; or perhaps change the runner that will run the tests,<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; No. The Runner is what invokes the rules, so rules can&#39;t change the runner.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Just like the ExpectedException rule intercepts the Statement and replaces it with its own, a ClassRule can intercept the Runner and replace it with its own (possibly).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Something that is not possible with an @BeforeClass<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; or @AfterClass annotation.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; The ability to package a common class-level setup/teardown behaviour and<br/>\n&gt;&gt; re-use it in many places is what rules provide over embedded<br/>\n&gt;&gt; before/after methods. That&#39;s very useful by itself, and they don&#39;t have<br/>\n&gt;&gt; to do anything more to justify their existence.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hmm, I guess we have to agree to disagree on that one.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Yahoo!
