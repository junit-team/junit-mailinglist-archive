The best way I\nthink is to use\nANT for this, in ant you can generate text-, html- and XML- files from the\ntestcases. The html\npages are pretty good, they show if anything went bad and it is simple to\nfind the testmethod that\nfailed.\n\nCheck out the JUNIT target at the ant.apache.org website. If you want I can\nsend\nyou our complete ANT script to compile and run tests.\n\n//Erik\n\n  ----- Original Message ----- \n  From: Srivastava, Pradeep \n  To: &#39;junit@yahoogroups.com&#39; \n  Sent: Monday, September 22, 2003 7:36 AM\n  Subject: [junit] How to capture junit test reports\n\n\n  Hi all,\n\n\n  I am new to junit, pls tell me how can I capture the output of junit tests\n  and put them in a text file or an html file for all cases of success,\n  failures or errors. I need to show this to the client claiming that our\n  system is passing all the unit tests cases. I am using junit without ANT.\n\n  pls send me some sample script if possible ..\n\n  Thanks and Regards\n  Pradeep\n  DISCLAIMER: The information in this message is confidential and may be\n  legally privileged.
