Making it protected<br/>\n&gt;  means that your test class (or a class it uses) needs to extend that class.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Not true, this is a common mussunderstanding, protected is /less/<br/>\nrestricted than package private so you get all you get from package<br/>\nprivate + that the functionality is available to extending classes<br/>\nfrom any package.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;  I still think that package protected gives you the best of both worlds:  the<br/>\n&gt;  method can be used from any class as long as it belongs to the same package,<br/>\n&gt;  so the coupling is minimal.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I agree with you that package-private is a better choice since the<br/>\nfunctionality you want to protect is available only to those classes<br/>\nin the same package and not also to those that just extend your class<br/>\nfrom any package.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would pick this approach any day over tweaking access to private<br/>\nmethods via reflection. I also think that Andreas suggestion, creating<br/>\na public interface that exposes what you want to expose is good, but I<br/>\nwould opt for that sooner and not as a last resort.<br/>\n<br/>\nI agree even more with previous posters that whan you feel that a<br/>\nprivate method should be tested you should first and foremost think<br/>\nabout your design. If it is meaningful to test it is most likely<br/>\nmeaning ful to use and it may be baecause the method is in the wrong<br/>\nplace that you feel it should be private.<br/>\n<br/>\nHeck, maybe the best way is to make it public, feel really about that<br/>\nmethod being public and figure out where it should be when you<br/>\nrefactor.<br/>\n<br/>\n/Regards</div>",
