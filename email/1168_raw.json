[mailto:mcphee@...]\n&gt; Sent: Friday, May 11, 2001 11:00 AM\n&gt; To: junit@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Subject: [junit] Unit testing stochastic (random) methods\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; We&#39;re using JUnit to test a evolutionary computation system where many\n&gt; (most?) of the methods are directly or indirectly stochastic (use\n&gt; random number generation).\n&gt;\n&gt; Writing unit tests for the deterministic parts of the system is pretty\n&gt; standard fare, but it&#39;s not obvious how to reasonably test the\n&gt; stochastic parts of the system.  At some level stochastic methods just\n&gt; aren&#39;t testable in the same way that deterministic methods are.  If\n&gt; you&#39;re writing a sorting routine, it should sort.  Period.  End of\n&gt; discussion.  If, however, you&#39;re simulating the roll of a six-sided\n&gt; die, then the best you can hope for is statistically plausible\n&gt; results, and it&#39;s then essentially impossible to tell the difference\n&gt; between a bug and a weird streak of luck in the random number\n&gt; generator.  (If your die simulation turns up &#39;3&#39; one hundred times in\n&gt; a row it&#39;s _probably_ a bug, but it might just be a _highly_ unlikely\n&gt; event resulting from your pseudo-random number generator.)\n&gt;\n&gt; At the moment we&#39;ve got some hacks where we call methods repeatedly\n&gt; (i.e., it&#39;s _slow_), and assert that the standard deviation of the\n&gt; results is below some arbitrary bound.  The bound was chosen by trial\n&gt; and error, running the tests over and over and putting the bound at a\n&gt; point where the tests fail about one time in 10.  This is obviously\n&gt; cheesy in the extreme.\n&gt;\n&gt; Presumably we&#39;re not the first people to have wandered into this tar\n&gt; pit, and I was wondering if anyone out there had solutions, pointers,\n&gt; ideas, etc.\n&gt;\n&gt; Many thanks,\n&gt;\n&gt; \tNic McPhee\n&gt; \tmcphee@...\n&gt; \tDivision of Science and Mathematics\n&gt; \tUniversity of Minnesota, Morris\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
