That&#39;s\na =\r\npotentially huge business plus.  Developers can add all their tests\n(tagged=\r\n @ignore) at the beginning of a cycle (and more whenever they\nthink of them=\r\n) without polluting the current status numbers with\nspurious failures.  In =\r\nmy experience, that fear has lead to an &quot;I&#39;ll\nadd it later&quot; tendency which,=\r\n of course, most often gets forgotten. \nThis new feature could pay for the =\r\nwhole transition in better\ntest-based progress tracking.\n\nLance Zant\n\n--- I=\r\nn junit@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Marvin Toll&quot; &lt;MarvinToll@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Cedri=\r\nc,\n&gt; \n&gt; Are you sure this is all Mark meant?\n&gt; \n&gt; I thought he was assertin=\r\ng a functional advantage ... not merely \n&gt; contrasting the stylistic nuance=\r\ns of the two API approaches \n&gt; (inheritance vs. declarative).\n&gt; \n&gt; (You wou=\r\nldn&#39;t want a large organization to incur the expense of \n&gt; retooling their =\r\nlocalhost in-container test environment just for a \n&gt; matter of style.
