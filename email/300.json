The question is, which<br/>\none should AssertionFailedException derive from.<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom the JDK 1.2.2 JavaDocs:<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;An Error is a subclass of Throwable that indicates serious problems that a<br/>\nreasonable application should not try to catch. Most such errors are<br/>\nabnormal conditions. The ThreadDeath error, though a &quot;normal&quot; condition, is<br/>\nalso a subclass of Error because most applications should not try to catch it.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;RuntimeException is the superclass of those exceptions that can be thrown<br/>\nduring the normal operation of the Java Virtual Machine.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nJohn Brewer<br/>\nJera Design</div>",
