I have a long-standing global-phobia.  Perhaps<br/>\n&gt;&gt;   it&#39;s  too  strong. #4 of course, isn&#39;t that differrent from #3 ( think<br/>\n&gt;&gt;   of<br/>\n&gt;&gt;   them as semi-global).<br/>\n&gt;&gt;   Have a missed a choice?<br/>\n&gt;&gt;    <br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Yes, the ones I mentioned on my previous response.  Factories for<br/>\n&gt;instance.  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>But how do you get a hold of the factory that knows the correct way to <br/>\nto create the object.  The answer is one of the choices above (as you go <br/>\non to mention below). <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;If there is behavior that you need in the class you are<br/>\n&gt;testing and it makes sense to break it out into its own class (as you<br/>\n&gt;have done) write a Factory that will give you back an instance of the<br/>\n&gt;needed class to be able to work with.  The Factory could be globally<br/>\n&gt;accessible, if that makes sense or pass it in at creation time.  Often<br/>\n&gt;times factories can give you access to several behaviors simultaneously,<br/>\n&gt;so if you need to pass in the Factory at instance creation time, you need<br/>\n&gt;only pass one or two.  If they are globally accessible however (either to<br/>\n&gt;the system as a whole, or to a package, etc.), you obviously don&#39;t need<br/>\n&gt;to pass them in.  I find that the factories I write are often static such<br/>\n&gt;that I don&#39;t need an instance of one to get an instance of the object I<br/>\n&gt;am after.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Let&#39;s say I have a DBQuery that obviously needs a DatabaseConnection to<br/>\n&gt;do much of its work.  The query doesn&#39;t need the connection for its full<br/>\n&gt;life-span, only for the short period of time in which to run against the<br/>\n&gt;DB, perhaps the rest of the time is doing maintenance work or creating<br/>\n&gt;Record objects to represent a row in the DB, etc.  So, I make a Factory<br/>\n&gt;(in this case probably a pool) available from which the query can grab a<br/>\n&gt;connection when it needs it and then give it back. <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>But that factory is  a global, and while factories have benefits, you <br/>\nhaven&#39;t gotten rid of the need to access global data, or pass in the <br/>\ninformation in one of the other manners. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; The connection too<br/>\n&gt;has things that it may need only for a short period of time and can give<br/>\n&gt;them up -- i.e. a Prepared or CallableStatement.  It can get the<br/>\n&gt;statement from a factory it has access to and then give it back when it&#39;s<br/>\n&gt;done.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>",
