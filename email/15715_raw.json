Both Eclipse and Ant, for example,\n&gt;&gt;already have built in the feature to gather and run all the tests in a\n&gt;&gt;package/directory.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; 1. We don&#39;t use Ant to run tests\n&gt; 2. reasons we don&#39;t use Eclipse&#39;s built-in functionality:\n&gt;   a. Eclipse seemed to skip some tests in the 3.0.x branch (we would \n&gt; select 1 project whose tests would number N, its dependent projects \n&gt; would weigh in at M tests.  So you would expect N + M tests to have been \n&gt; run.  Not so.  It was N + M - X tests.  I don&#39;t know where things were \n&gt; getting lost.  I noticed this because I had a test in which I was \n&gt; forcing a failure and it never failed.  Why?  It never ran.)\n&gt;   b. using JUnit-Addons we actually are able to be more selective in the \n&gt; types of tests we run through Eclipse Launchers.  We have launchers for \n&gt; Units only, Units and Database Tests, Functional Tests, and All Tests.  \n&gt; The suite is built on the fly via tests implementing specific interfaces.\n\nWe use Maven and Ant in different projects, and yes, we let them gather \ntests in their usual way (via filename filtering). But my original \nrequest was driven by the need to get new developers up to speed by \nhanding them the test code and telling them to fire it up in a JUnit GUI \nTestRunner and running per-package tests. Our test method names \ncorrespond to the names of the methods being tested, so it&#39;s pretty easy \nto tell what each test is doing.\n\n\n\n",
