I&#39;d really =\r\nlike to be\nable to use the latest version of hamcrest with junit (and I don=\r\n&#39;t have a\nlarge test case suite to worry about it).\n\nAnother question is: i=\r\nf I can use hamcrest 1.2 then is there a junit jar\nthat doesn&#39;t include the=\r\n old hamcrest classes?\n\ntia,\n\n:- alex\n\n\nOn Wed, Aug 18, 2010 at 4:47 AM, Da=\r\nvid Saff &lt;david@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; On Tue, Aug 17, 2010 at 6:28 PM, pn=\r\niederw &lt;pniederw@...&lt;pniederw%40gmail.com&gt;&gt;\n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;ve noticed=\r\n that JUnit includes an (outdated) version of Hamcrest.

We guessed that of people who =\r\nused the hamcrest features\n&gt; bundled with JUnit, there were more that would=\r\n be hurt by a version\n&gt; change than would be helped by it, so we&#39;ve stayed =\r\nhere.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Why is there no junit-dep anymore, i.e. how are we supposed t=\r\no use JUnit\n&gt; with Hamcrest 1.2?\n&gt;\n&gt; junit-dep has been up on github for ev=\r\nery release. Whoever has been\n&gt; putting JUnit up on maven, I take it, hasn&#39;=\r\nt been also putting up\n&gt; junit-dep? I&#39;m sorry to say that I&#39;m very aware th=\r\nat a lot of people\n&gt; are indebted to the anonymous time-donor who&#39;d been ke=\r\neping the maven\n&gt; repos up-to-date until several months ago. I&#39;ve been relu=\r\nctant to\n&gt; accept full responsibility for feeding a repository I neither us=\r\ne nor\n&gt; fully understand until some point where I was sure I could quickly\n=\r\n&gt; respond to millions of users who got their junit jars auto-updated in\n&gt; a=\r\n way that broke all their tests.
