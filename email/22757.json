In your sql exception test, the first stack trace is from the JUnit expected annotation. The second is from the jMock expectations. We tried to strike a balance in jMock between being providing enough and too much information, but it&#39;s hard to be general. One trick, though, is that I think that some of the IDE&#39;s can be configured to hide certain packages in stack traces.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>is it mean, in short that, We have to live with this ?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks and regards<br/>\n<br/>\nRaja</div>",
