B. Rainsberger&quot; &lt;jbrains762@...&gt;\r\n\r\n&gt; &gt; Do you care whether the assert is run for the first time, or\n&gt; &gt; simply that it\n&gt; &gt; still fails? I suppose one possibility is that the assert is\n&gt; &gt; run, passes and\n&gt; &gt; you&#39;re surprised. That should shock you immediately and not\n&gt; &gt; allow you to\n&gt; &gt; forget. :)\n&gt;\n&gt;Maybe both, but foremost the first -- I&#39;d like to know that the assert was\n&gt;picked up.\n&gt;\n&gt;While I know the goal is to add assertions that should fail, I do sometimes\n&gt;end up with assertions that pass immediately, and I can&#39;t always figure out\n&gt;a way to have avoided that.\n\nHm. Why are you so concerned about it? Sometimes you write assertions that \npass because you refactored earlier to a more general case. That&#39;s not \nnecessarily a bad thing, is it?\n\nIf the assertion you just wrote is incorrect, then you have a pretty narrow \nsection of code to doublecheck. The only way to avoid that is not to make \nmistakes. Good luck with that. :)\n\nJBR.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;________________________________________________________________________\n&gt;________________________________________________________________________\n&gt;\n&gt;Message: 20\n&gt;    Date: Fri, 27 Jul 2001 13:11:22 -0700\n&gt;    From: Shane Duan &lt;sduan@...&gt;\n&gt;Subject: Re: Re: re - assert counting\n&gt;\n&gt;Several times when I tried to do test on a package and test number turned \n&gt;out\n&gt;to be a little bit off, I went in and checked my metod that constructing \n&gt;the\n&gt;test suite.

You don&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; &gt;give the types of the arrays nor their expected lengths (do they hold\n&gt; &gt; &gt;a few simple elements, dozens of complicated ones, millions, ...).\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Perhaps you&#39;d be better off constructing a vector of differences and\n&gt; &gt; &gt;asserting the vector as empty.  Adding the differences to a string\n&gt; &gt; &gt;and asserting it as equal to &quot;&quot;.  Or counting the differences and\n&gt; &gt; &gt;assertEquals(0, count).\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; [...]\n&gt; &gt; This builds up a list of differences. The list knows how to present \n&gt;itself\n&gt; &gt; as a string (List does that). Each difference presents itself as a \n&gt;string\n&gt; &gt; (ArrayDifference does that). If you need prettier output, create a class\n&gt; &gt; that wraps a List of ArrayDifferences and makes the output prettier.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I like the sound of this technique. I think I&#39;ll put this up as a best\n&gt; &gt; practice until someone else tells me something wrong with it.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;________________________________________________________________________\n&gt;________________________________________________________________________\n&gt;\n&gt;Message: 22\n&gt;    Date: Sat, 28 Jul 2001 01:04:29 -0000\n&gt;    From: reply_das@...\n&gt;Subject: Newbie question ..\n&gt;\n&gt;Hi all,\n&gt;I&#39;m new to using JUnit and I have a question on how to handle the\n&gt;following situation.\n&gt;\n&gt;I have ClassA which accepts a Collection of objects in its\n&gt;constructor and constructs a tree structure from it. In response to\n&gt;messages from other classes, ClassA must modify the state of this\n&gt;tree that it has constructed.\n&gt;\n&gt;So I have a TestClassA TestCase which has a method testDoSomething()\n&gt;which calls the &quot;state changing&quot; method on ClassA. Now, how do I\n&gt;assert whether the states have changed correctly? The TestClassA does\n&gt;not have access to the internal tree of ClassA.\n&gt;\n&gt;I have already written separate TestCases for the objects (nodes)\n&gt;making up the tree and those individual tests seem to be working\n&gt;fine. Does this mean that I do not need to test this from the\n&gt;container class? Or is there some other way to do this?\n&gt;\n&gt;Any help appreciated.\n&gt;Thanks,\n&gt;--Das\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;________________________________________________________________________\n&gt;________________________________________________________________________\n&gt;\n&gt;Message: 23\n&gt;    Date: Tue, 24 Jul 2001 20:29:54 -0400\n&gt;    From: &quot;Mathieu Gervais&quot; &lt;egoine_@...&gt;\n&gt;Subject: Re: Reporting more then 1 failed assertion per test\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;Another example:\n&gt; &gt;// For two arrays: expected, actual\n&gt;\n&gt;If I wanted this to work, I would code a utility method that does the\n&gt;comparaison:\n&gt;\n&gt;public void assertArraysEquals(Objectp[] excepected, Object[] actual) \n&gt;throws\n&gt;Exception{\n&gt;     boolean notEquals = false;\n&gt;     String msg =null;\n&gt;      if (expected.length != actual.length) {\n&gt;         notEquals = true; msg = &quot;Lenght not equals&quot;;\n&gt;     }else {\n&gt;           for (int i = Math.min(expected.length-1, actual.length-1); i &gt;=\n&gt;0;i--)\n&gt;           {\n&gt;             if (!expected[i].euqals( actual[i])) {\n&gt;                     notEquals=true;\n&gt;                     msg=&quot;Values for index &quot; + i + &quot; aren&#39;t equals&quot;;\n&gt;             }\n&gt;           }\n&gt;     }\n&gt;     if (notEquals) {  fail(msg + &quot;actual array values are....&quot; +\n&gt;arrayToString(actual) )  };\n&gt;}\n&gt;\n&gt;This gives you, in that particular case, what you said you wanted, i.e. the\n&gt;information to be able to debug the problem without going into the \n&gt;debugger.\n&gt;It&#39;s a little bit more work, but you sort of get what you want.\n&gt;\n&gt;Mathieu\n&gt;\n&gt;----- Original Message -----\n&gt;From: Robert Sartin\n&gt;To: junit@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;Sent: Tuesday, July 24, 2001 7:56 PM\n&gt;Subject: RE: [junit] Reporting more then 1 failed assertion per test\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;--- Vladimir Bossicard &lt;vladimir@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; To &quot;correct&quot; that, you have to change the framework (record the\n&gt; &gt; errors and throw an exception at the end of the test method).  But I\n&gt; &gt; really don&#39;t think that this will solve problems:\n&gt;\n&gt;Yes, changing that aspect of the framework would be a very significant,\n&gt;and challenging, change. It&#39;d be interesting to see how well it could\n&gt;be done without having to change other interfaces or any existing\n&gt;tests. Perhaps by having the assert* methods find the test context (a\n&gt;slightly new/changed concept) in which they are running and logging the\n&gt;failure there.\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;    assertTrue(obj != null);\n&gt; &gt;    assertTrue(obj.status() == 3);\n&gt;\n&gt;This would throw a NullPointerException (we really can&#39;t change the\n&gt;behavior of the JVM) in the second assertTrue. The framework might deal\n&gt;with an Exception from a test that had already failed an assertion as\n&gt;meaningless and not to be recorded, or might be clever about what\n&gt;should be recorded.\n&gt;\n&gt;Another example:\n&gt;\n&gt;   // For two arrays: expected, actual\n&gt;   assertEquals(expected.length, actual.length);\n&gt;   for (int i = Math.min(expected.length-1, actual.length-1); i &gt;= 0;\n&gt;i--)\n&gt;   {\n&gt;     assertEquals(expected[i], actual[i]);\n&gt;   }\n&gt;\n&gt;This would log a complete list of incorrect elements in addition to the\n&gt;size being wrong. So, this example just goes to show that multiple\n&gt;reporting might be helpful in some circumstances. Obviously not all,\n&gt;and quite possibly not useful enough for the sizeable and challenging\n&gt;framework change required to support it.\n&gt;\n&gt;Regards,\n&gt;\n&gt;Rob\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;__________________________________________________\n&gt;Do You Yahoo!?\n&gt;Make international calls for as low as $.04/minute with Yahoo!
