I mean, I have a framework that uses xml configuration\nand XPATH to m=\r\nake some assertion tests from our server, and I would\nlike to run them usin=\r\ng junit, as it would be easier to generate\nreports and so on. The problem i=\r\ns that the tests are dinamic and\ndepend on an external configuration file. =\r\nSo if i do asserts inside a\nloop it would leave the method on the first fai=\r\nl/error, is there any\nway to store all the asserts and process them afterwa=\r\nrds? what would\nyou suggest?\n\nthanks\nemerson\n\n\n",
