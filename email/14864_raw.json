Reflection\n&gt; &gt; is definitely an option then.\n&gt;\n&gt; OK, good :)\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; I still think that there is little point in testing on the device\n&gt; &gt; itself. Or rather, that it makes little sense as long as you don&#39;t have\n&gt; a &gt; set of tests on the emulator.\n&gt;\n&gt; Uhm... not sure I follow. I presume testing on the device itself would be\n&gt; better than no testing at all, e.g. in the event that you don&#39;t have a\n&gt; good enough emulator, or emulator tests.\n\n\nMy experience is that testing on an emulator should be the first priority\nbecause it will catch a lot of bugs that will happen on *all* devices. Once\nyou have a comprehensive emulator test suite, you will probably see that\nyour code works fine on 90% of the devices and that 10% of them will require\nadditional debugging (on-device this time, since these bugs didn&#39;t show on\nthe emulator).\n\nMost of the bugs that I see in JavaME applications are simple programming\nerrors, not device-specific errors, and they can therefore be exposed and\ntested in an emulator. But maybe your experience differs?\n\n--\nCedric\n\n\nAnyway, if you are insterested in knowing whether or not your application\n&gt; will run (&quot;correctly&quot;) on &quot;some&quot; J2ME device, it would also be better than\n&gt; nothing to run your tests in a J2ME JVM on a regular desktop machine or\n&gt; something like that, running for example linux or Windows (if the virtual\n&gt; machine supports one of those platforms). This might be a good alternative\n&gt; if you are not able to get hold of a suitable, full-featured emulator.\n&gt; Right?\n&gt;\n&gt; --\n&gt; John\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; __________________________________\n&gt; Yahoo!
