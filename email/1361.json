In other words, they generate the same stimuli as the users, and<br/>\ntest for the same behaviors that the user would expect.  The sequence of<br/>\nstimuli and behaviors is essentially a scenario of a use case.  I believe<br/>\nthese are typically called acceptance tests.<br/>\n<br/>\nOnce we start peeking under the hood, we can go after parts of the system -<br/>\nsubsystems and collaborations of objects - and test them for functional<br/>\nbehavior as well.  A use case scenario gets decomposed into more detailed<br/>\ninternal scenarios that assign responsibility for the use case behaviors to<br/>\nobjects and collaborations.  This decomposition/scenario design is a more<br/>\nformal process step in some methodologies, and is less formal in XP but<br/>\nsomething a good designer will consider nevertheless.  We can write tests<br/>\nthat run the internal scenario, generating the stimuli (probably method<br/>\ncalls) and looking for the correct behavior (state changes, generated<br/>\noutputs, etc.).  I don&#39;t know what to call these - perhaps &quot;functional<br/>\nunit tests.&quot;  These seem to be more of what you&#39;re talking about.<br/>\n<br/>\n[BTW, has anyone found that these kinds of test can be a real pain,<br/>\nespecially if the scenario represents behavior somewhere &quot;in the middle&quot;<br/>\nof a longer-running use case?  The set up can get complicated to make<br/>\nsure the system state is correct to start the test, and/or the tear down<br/>\ncan get complex to make sure we leave the system in a good state.  I&#39;ve<br/>\nseen suggestions to use mock objects that behave as if the system state<br/>\nis correct to get around some of this.  Comments?]<br/>\n<br/>\nThen there&#39;s another type of test.  If we take an object (class), and its<br/>\ncollection of methods, we can write tests that exercise each method.  If<br/>\nwe want complete coverage, we write tests that exercise all the code paths<br/>\nof each method, test for ranges of parameter values, etc.  These tests<br/>\naren&#39;t concerned with how the object works in a collaboration, just with<br/>\nhow the object works in relative isolation.  I consider these &quot;unit tests&quot;<br/>\nbut that&#39;s just my opinion.  Note that as we look at objects that represent<br/>\ncollaborations of objects (e.g., controllers, facades, etc.), their methods<br/>\nmay trigger or control an internal scenario, hence a unit test for them<br/>\nstarts to take on the flavor of the &quot;functional unit tests&quot; above.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as what tools you use to run the tests, it can be JUnit or another<br/>\ntesting tool ranging from hand built code to big testing tools like Segue<br/>\nSilk Test or some such.  JUnit is very good at writing tests that call<br/>\nJava methods and look for behavior that can be tested by calling Java<br/>\nmethods.  Tests that need to generate, for example, HTML posts and look<br/>\nat generated HTML output, may be better written with HTTPUnit or Silk<br/>\nTest, etc.  Tests that work against databases may need SQLUnit, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust for the record, I&#39;m not at all claiming that anything written above<br/>\nis part of XP.  These are just some of our recent musings on unit testing,<br/>\nand we&#39;re probably over-analyzing things, but that keeps us off the<br/>\nstreets.  ;-)  Your post related to them, and it seemed as good a time as<br/>\nany to toss them out and see what happens.<br/>\n<br/>\nA question for the list:  How do you organize your tests, particularly<br/>\nif you write tests that are of both the functional scenario and single<br/>\nobject unit test varieties?  The common approach seems to be to gather<br/>\nall the tests for a given class in one test class.  What about the<br/>\nscenario type of tests?  Organized by use case?  What communicates<br/>\nbetter, especially if we want to use the tests as documentation?<br/>\n<br/>\nRegards,<br/>\n-Paul</div>",
