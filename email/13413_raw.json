Oh -\n&gt;  &gt;&gt; I&#39;m not writing much new code.  Most of the unit tests are for code\n&gt;  &gt;&gt; that already exists for which I&#39;m fixing bugs.\n&gt; \n&gt;  &gt; Good luck with that. I strongly recommend you also try to test-drive a\n&gt;  &gt; bunch of code, because that will teach you the goal for refactoring the\n&gt;  &gt; legacy stuff. If you don&#39;t know where you&#39;re going, how do you know you\n&gt;  &gt; got there?\n&gt; \n&gt; J.B., I&#39;m probably being block-headed but I don&#39;t quite get what you\n&gt; mean.  Can you say a little more about that?\n\nIf you spend too much time writing tests for existing code, you&#39;ll learn \nlegacy code design techniques. Those are good for working around designs \nthat are difficult to test, but not necessarily good for designs you can \ncreate from scratch. I recommend that you also spend time writing new \ncode using TDD (&quot;test-driving&quot;) so that you get more feedback as to what \na good, testable design looks like. This way when you add tests to \nexisting code, you&#39;ll know what kind of design to work towards, rather \nthan just how to get around the existing design.\n\nI hope that is more clear.\n-- \nJ.
