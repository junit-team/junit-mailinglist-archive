Every method <br/>\nthat can be eliminated is one less thing to document, one less thing to <br/>\nexplain, one less thing to stumble over when you&#39;re looking for <br/>\nsomething else.<br/>\n<br/>\nI suspect them becoming public had something to do with the relationship <br/>\nbetween the old junit.framework.Assert and the new org.junit.Assert <br/>\nclasses. (The former now extends the latter.) I don&#39;t know why there are <br/>\ntwo classes here. They don&#39;t appear to be substantially different. Could <br/>\nwe just get rid of the new one. Would anything break? Hmm, looking at I <br/>\nwas able to remove org.junit.framework.Assert fairly easily. I had to do <br/>\na search for the static imports and replace them with <br/>\njunit.framework.Assert. I had to make junit.framework.Assert extend <br/>\nObject like it used to. Finally I had to fix one class where <br/>\norg.junit.Assert was referenced by its fully package qualified name. <br/>\nNothing broke that wasn&#39;t broken before, and a couple of tests that were <br/>\npreviously broken started passing.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo whatever you do with failSame, etc. I recommend removing <br/>\norg.junit.framework.Assert.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n﻿Elliotte Rusty Harold  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:elharo@...\">elharo@...</a><br/>\nXML in a Nutshell 3rd Edition Just Published!<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.cafeconleche.org/books/xian3/\">http://www.cafeconleche.org/books/xian3/</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0596007647/cafeaulaitA/ref=nosim\">http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0596007647/cafeaulaitA/ref=nosim</a></div>",
