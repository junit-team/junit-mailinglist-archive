You could do that using a similar synt=\r\nax to that outlined\n&gt; &gt; below, but it would make it harder to read tests de=\r\nclaratively.\nWith the\n&gt; &gt; current design, if I want to know what data a tes=\r\nt will have\navailable, I\n&gt; &gt; read the @Befores (and @Parameters). Then I ca=\r\nn read all the tests\nassuming\n&gt; &gt; those are the conditions under which it w=\r\nill execute. If I have a\ndiffferent\n&gt; &gt; fixture, I go to a different class.=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Can you tell me a little more about what benefits you see from\nyo=\r\nur proposed\n&gt; &gt; arrangement and in which circumstances it would be superior=\r\n to\nhaving tests\n&gt; &gt; with different fixtures in different classes?\n&gt; \n&gt; I d=\r\non&#39;t think that the parameterization and the test fixture are the\nsame.\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; And I think it&#39;s normal to have part of my test fixture shared in a \n&gt; Be=\r\nfore-Method. And then I extend (or modify) this setup slightly inside \n&gt; my=\r\n different test methods.\n&gt; \n&gt; I want to do some tests with a customer objec=\r\nt, for example how the \n&gt; customer responds to billing differnt items to hi=\r\ns account.\n&gt; Some of theses tests can be parameterized, some can&#39;t.\n&gt; \n&gt; e.=\r\ng. I want to write a test that billing &quot;null&quot; is not allowed and \n&gt; throws =\r\nan exception. This test is not parameterized.\n&gt; Then I want to bill differe=\r\nnt goods and I want to see, that the\ncustomer \n&gt; responds correctly by say =\r\ncalculating a correct bonus, according to his \n&gt; state. To check this, I ne=\r\ned to bill 10 different goods, cause some of \n&gt; them have a bonus, some don=\r\n&#39;t, etc.\n&gt; These 10 tests can be parameterized with a good to bill and the =\r\n\n&gt; resulting bonus. They still use the same fixture, namely the customer \n&gt;=\r\n object.\n&gt; \n&gt; I would like all these tests in the same class, since they us=\r\ne the same \n&gt; fixture and test a coherent set of functionality.\n&gt; \n&gt; Does t=\r\nhat make more sense now?\n&gt; \nIt does make sense for me. :-)\n\n\n\n",
