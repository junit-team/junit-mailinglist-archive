A &quot;info<br/>\n&gt; property&quot; and a &quot;info entity&quot; is &quot;meta-data&quot; generated by the &quot;Entity<br/>\n&gt; Introspector&quot;. For to do that I need create and populate all entities<br/>\n&gt; inside of some container and check the respective existence of some<br/>\n&gt; &quot;info property&quot; and &quot;info entity&quot; one-by-one; this is very tedious.<br/>\n&gt; For make this more affordable I&#39;m thinking in use generics in test cases.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Two things:<br/>\n<br/>\n1. If you a really testing the entity introspector, then I believe you <br/>\nshould try to test it directly, instead of testing it with the state <br/>\nmachine. What would that test look like?<br/>\n<br/>\n2. Very often I try to generalize quickly, because I believe I <br/>\nunderstand a design concept. When I try to write the general case, I <br/>\nfind it difficult, so I start by writing 3 specific cases, then observe <br/>\nthe patterns, then extract the general case from them. I believe it <br/>\ntakes less time for me to do that, compared to trying the general case <br/>\nand failing to do it correctly.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Your Portuguese is perfect:D<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Nao, el portugues de /Babelfish/ e perfeito. :) [This was /my/ Portuguese.]<br/>\n<br/>\nTake care.<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJ.
