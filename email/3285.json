(Maybe the suggestions in<br/>\n&gt; this thread will help me change that.)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>There is usually an underlying mental assertion when using System.out, for<br/>\nexample.  You see the result and compare it mentally to an expected outcome.<br/>\nThis is important information for you and the next person to touch the code,<br/>\nso I suggest it&#39;s best codified by a test that lives beyond the debugging<br/>\nsession.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Moreover, logging debug messages at this granularity tends to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; reduce the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; readability of the code, in my experience.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I agree. If you use debug output/log statements, they are there to<br/>\n&gt; perform a specific task: find a bug. Once located and exterminated,<br/>\n&gt; their function is over, take them out.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>The OP suggested using debug logging and then turning them off, rather than<br/>\ntaking them out.  I agree that if used for debugging, they should be<br/>\nremoved.... and replaced by a test.<br/>\n<br/>\nFinding the bug is usually the most time-consuming step; fixing it usually<br/>\ntakes less time.  I have noticed that I usually can&#39;t stuff enough context<br/>\ninformation into debug messages as I&#39;d like, and this slows down my<br/>\ndebugging.  Rather, if I can capture that context in a test, it&#39;s easier to<br/>\nfind.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, when I find myself wanting to use debug logging statements, I&#39;ll attempt<br/>\nto write a test instead to verify my assertions.  This isn&#39;t always easy, but<br/>\nmany times it leads to some well-deserved refactoring that I think make it<br/>\nworth it.  If I don&#39;t already have a good test suite, then it may take some<br/>\ntime to isolate the bug, but in the end this yields a more comprehensive set<br/>\nof tests.  I&#39;m still learning...<br/>\n<br/>\nMike<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nMike Clark<br/>\nClarkware Consulting, Inc.<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.clarkware.com\">http://www.clarkware.com</a><br/>\n720.851.2014</div>",
