I just\n&gt; found it non-intuitive that JUnit gave each test method invocation its\n&gt; own instance, especially when they also provided the setUp() method. I\n&gt; used JUnit a long time before I realized this object wrapping was going\n&gt; on. In a previous post to this list, I asked if anyone could help me\n&gt; understand what benefit I get for that wrapping. I mentioned that the\n&gt; only benefit I could see was that if I screw up my  setUp() and\n&gt; tearDown() methods and don&#39;t actually initialize and clean up the\n&gt; fixture correctly, the wrapping of method invocations may let me get\n&gt; away with it. Vladimir Bossicard agreed that that was a benefit, and no\n&gt; one else offered any others.\n\nHaving grown up with JUnit - and vice versa - I don&#39;t find the\ninstance-per-test approach unintuitive any more. It gives me the maximum\nseparation between two tests, and that&#39;s a good thing.\n\nAnother benefit is that you can build suites with just selected test cases\nfrom a given test class.\n\nJohannes\n\n\n",
