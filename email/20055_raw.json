The\n&gt;  response to Crap4J was so positive that we decided to go further and\n&gt;  created a dedicated website crap4j.org &lt;http://www.crap4j.org&gt; .\n&gt;\n&gt;  We&#39;ve had hundreds of downloads since we launched the site,  along with\n&gt;  many requests for Ant support and support for IDEs other than Eclipse.\n&gt;\n&gt;  We just added Ant support in 1.1.4, and we are planning to support other\n&gt;  IDEs like NetBeans and IntelliJ (BTW, if you are interested in\n&gt;  contribute to plug-in development please let us know).\n&gt;\n&gt;  If you have a chance, please try Crap4J on your project and let us know\n&gt;  what you think.  We are interested in getting this group&#39;s feedback on\n&gt;  Crap4j and suggestions for improving and extending it.\n&gt;\n&gt;  The home page is: www.crap4j.org &lt;http://www.crap4j.org&gt; ; from there\n&gt;  you can navigate to the download page.\n&gt;\n&gt;  If you have any problems installing it or running it, feel free to ask\n&gt;  for help on the forum or file a bug report or feature request.\n&gt;  &lt;http://trac.crap4j.org/&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;  Thanks,\n&gt;\n&gt;  Alberto\n&gt;\n&gt;  [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt;\n&gt;                    \n\n\n\n-- \nJason Rogers\n\n&quot;I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live;\nyet not I, but Christ liveth in me: and the life\nwhich I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of\nthe Son of God, who loved me, and gave\nhimself for me.&quot;\n    Galatians 2:20\n\n",
