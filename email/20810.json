    "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-407593144\">Hi Victor, <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; What is the best practice for testing a simple database query <br/>\n&gt; that generates several thousand moderately complex records of XML.<br/>\n&gt; Data is constantly changing, so it wouldn&#39;t make sense to <br/>\n&gt; test against real data.<br/>\n&gt; I am thinking the tester should create a test table, populate <br/>\n&gt; it with contrived data, and then just read the generated XML <br/>\n&gt; against the known result.<br/>\n&gt; Is there a more elegant solution?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>If there are general statements that you can make about the xml,<br/>\nwhich shoud be true no matter what is in the database, those<br/>\nstatements can form the core of a test. Of course, some such<br/>\ntests might not be useful. For example, assuming you are not<br/>\ncreating the xml with your own code, there&#39;s no point in<br/>\nchecking that it is valid, but you could  check for strucural<br/>\nproblems that could result from bad setup on your part.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne way to come up with such statements is to think back on<br/>\nany issues you have seen in the past. Were some of them<br/>\nobservable by instpection of the xml alone, without reference<br/>\nto the content of the database? Those could be tests.<br/>\n<br/>\nCharlie</div>",
