Like the text runner, but \ngenerates HTML.  Obviously, this is implemented by the ANT tasks but, \nsince we use a make build, this isnt terribly useful to me.  Its \nprototype code at the moment, but it works.  Ive implemented \nTestListener.  My columns currently include:\n\n- Test name\n- Output (with stderr coloured differently to stdout)\n- Problem (ie. Exception or Assert)\n- Time\n- Memory delta\n\nI use Velocity to do the formatting and stick some summary data at the \ntop.\n\nHas anyone else done one of these?  Is anyone else interested?  Should \nI publish the code?\n\nAndrew.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n",
