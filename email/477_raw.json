I posted a message to the WebObjects\nlist about it a little while ago, (below). I&#39;ve since upgraded to junit 3.5\nand the line which starts the test runner has changed to:\n\nnew junit.awtui.TestRunner().start(new String[]{&quot;AllTests&quot;});\n\nAnother thing I forgot to mention in the post below is that I&#39;ve added a\nstatic inner class to my Application which provides access to Application\nfrom within your TestCase. The inner class is constructed with a live\napplication in the Application constructor.\n\n    /**\n     * provides static access to the application instance for the unit\ntests.\n     */\n    public static class Access {\n\n        private static Access instance;\n        private Application app;\n\n        private Access(Application app) {\n            this.app = app;\n        }\n\n        public static Access instance() {\n            return instance;\n        }\n\n        public Application application() {\n            return app;\n        }\n\n    }\n\nThen in your test case you just write\nApplication.Access.instance().application() to get hold of the reference.\nFrom there you can call pageWithName() or whatever to get hold of pages, a\nSession etc.\n\nI havn&#39;t yet got this working in a deployment environment, but it&#39;s been\nvery useful in my development environment.\n\nHope that helps,\n\nEmily\n\n----- posted to &#39;webobjects-dev@...&#39; on Mon 5th Feb -------\n\nI have started to introduce unit testing to an existing WO application. I\nhave used JUnit on previous pure Java projects and I know how valuable it is\nto have them. One of the problems I found running JUnit with WO is that your\nWOComponents etc need to be instantiated with suitably initialised\nApplication and Session objects, so I found I needed to kick the tests off\nfrom within the running application, instead of kicking off the tests and\nhaving them instantiate the application. Therefore I&#39;ve put this bit of code\nin the constructor of my Main class, which is called after the application\nis properly started up and is ready to go:\n\n\tpublic Main() {\n        app = (Application) application();\n        s = (Session) session();\n\n        if (app.shouldRunTests() && !app.testsRunningNow()) {\n            app.setTestsRunningNow(true);\n\n            // run the tests in their own thread\n            Runnable runnable = new Runnable(){\n                public void run() {\n                    new junit.ui.TestRunner().start(new\nString[]{&quot;AllTests&quot;}, new junit.util.StandardTestSuiteLoader());\n                }\n            };\n            Thread testThread = new java.lang.Thread(runnable);\n            testThread.start();\n        }\n    }\n\nThe unit tests run in their own thread, but my application wasn&#39;t designed\nfor multithreading, so I usually wait until all my unit tests have finished\nbefore trying to access the application manually. The other thing is that if\nyou click &quot;exit&quot; on the unit test window, your whole application exits - I\nhavn&#39;t found a way round this yet. Also note that my tests have to be really\ncareful to leave my Application class in the same state it found it. (It&#39;s\nfairly easy to set it up so that every test gets its own session).\n\nAs for functional, (black box, user perspective) tests, I tried WOUnit,\nhttp://wounit.jmltech.com/ (I just tried the site and it&#39;s down - anyone\nknow what happened to it?) which is based on httpUnit. I found it to be more\ndesigned for static sites, and wasn&#39;t actually giving me much once I needed\nto log in and keep track of my session state, so I just used plain httpUnit.\nThis was working well until I ran into a brick wall: javascript and\nVBScript. My pages are absolutely littered with the stuff, and httpUnit\ndoesn&#39;t have any kind of scripting interpreter and can&#39;t imitate a browser\nin that way. I had to put creation of automated functional tests on hold\nbasically, until either httpUnit adds support for scripting or we manage to\nrefactor out the scripting from our pages.\n\nI&#39;d be very interested to hear how other WO developers have been using JUnit\nor other unit testing frameworks, or if you have criticisms of my approach.\n\nRegards,\nEmily\n\nadera + Emily Bache\nMaskingatan 5\n417 64 G�teborg\ne-mail:emily.bache@...\nphone int +46 (0)31 779 35 00\ndirect +46 (0)31 779 35 14\nmobile +46 (0)703 73 35 14\nfax +46 (0)31 779 35 99\nhttp://www.aderagroup.com\n \n\n",
