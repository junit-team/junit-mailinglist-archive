I&#39;m not trying to bait you, but if you have a automate=\r\nd code\n&gt;testing\n&gt;&gt;tool (let&#39;s be generic here, so no-one thinks that I&#39;m on=\r\n the ParaSoft\n&gt;&gt;payroll :-) and it complains about your code then either th=\r\ne tool is\n&gt;&gt;defective or your code is sub-optimal.\n&gt;\n&gt;Not necessarily. \n\nMa=\r\nybe not, but I still think that those are the two most likely reasons.\n\n&gt;If=\r\n I have a public API, it may be worthwhile to try to interpret the\n&gt;dozens =\r\nof RuntimeExceptions that my code may throw, since this would\n&gt;help my clie=\r\nnts decipher the problem. In this case, it would be nice to\n&gt;use something =\r\nlike JTest to discover all the RuntimeExceptions my\n&gt;public API might throw=\r\n.\n&gt;\n&gt;If, however, we deal with code deep within our library that the outsid=\r\ne\n&gt;world doesn&#39;t use directly, and if we can be reasonably sure that, for\n&gt;=\r\nexample, Class A never passes a null reference to Class B, then it\n&gt;would l=\r\nikely be overkill to worry about what happens when Class B\n&gt;receives a null=\r\n reference. As Ron Jeffries would say, if you&#39;re the\n&gt;only client, then sim=\r\nply don&#39;t pass null! (Loose paraphrase, there.)\n\nI think that I have alread=\r\ny conceded this point a couple of times yesterday, but I&#39;ll do it again for=\r\n the record. Agreed. Agreed. Agreed! :-)\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt;Here is another way of putting=\r\n it:\n&gt;&gt;&gt;Personally I think that the &#39;exposure&#39; of (mainly) NullPointers by\n=\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt;applying generated tests that put nonsense parameter values in\n&gt;methods\n=\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt;does improve the quality of the product.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;Agreed. :-)\n&gt;\n&gt;Well, it ca=\r\nn identify issues, but I&#39;m not sure that it improves\n&gt;quality, since it may=\r\n lead to a morass of duplication of the form\n&gt;\n&gt;    if (blah =3D=3D null) {=\r\n\n&gt;        throw new IllegalArgumentException(&quot;Blah was null.&quot;);\n&gt;    }\n&gt;\n&gt;T=\r\nhat hurts the internal quality of the product.\n\nI would argue that comprehe=\r\nnsive guard conditions never hurt the internal quality of the product. Now,=\r\n I agree that guard conditions are often ugly code, but some of that could =\r\nbe refactored into private methods.\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt;The motto &#39;Garbage in Garbage out&#39; =\r\nstill applies in this case. As an\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;Not agreed. GIGO is only for non-rob=\r\nust code. I think that &quot;Garbage\n&gt;In&quot;\n&gt;&gt;should cause appropriate guard condi=\r\ntions to be triggered and an\n&gt;&gt;appropriate response to be generated NPE or =\r\nIAE (your choice). For\n&gt;&gt;anything other than the most trivial of code, I do=\r\n not want to ever\n&gt;&gt;contribute to &quot;Garbage Out&quot;. As developers we usually h=\r\nave no control\n&gt;over\n&gt;&gt;the many potential ways that our code could be used,=\r\n but we do have\n&gt;&gt;control over how it responds.\n&gt;\n&gt;Once again, a public API=\r\n is different from code whose only client is\n&gt;you. :)\n\nAgreed ... see above=\r\n.\n\n&gt;&lt;snip /&gt;\n&gt;&gt;This is the concept of &quot;graceful degredation&quot;. A web browser=\r\n is a very\n&gt;&gt;good example of this .... a lot of web pages have awful HTML a=\r\nnd yet\n&gt;most\n&gt;&gt;of them display acceptably, because the browser takes what i=\r\nt&#39;s given\n&gt;and\n&gt;&gt;does the best it can with it. A browser cannot throw an ex=\r\nception, but\n&gt;it\n&gt;&gt;can try to render what it&#39;s given. All software should d=\r\no the best it\n&gt;can\n&gt;&gt;with what it&#39;s given or when possible reject unaccepta=\r\nble inputs.\n&gt;\n&gt;I hate this, because the browser just throws away parts of a=\r\n page, and\n&gt;it&#39;s not always easy to tell why that happened. It would be bet=\r\nter, in\n&gt;my opinion, if the browser at least complained to a log or somethi=\r\nng.\n\nI agree that such behaviour should be logged, but the internet exists =\r\nwith the popularity that it has today because a page&#39;s HTML has to be prett=\r\ny bad before someone can&#39;t surf it. This is a good thing in a browser. Is i=\r\nt a good thing in a public API? Maybe not, but graceful degredation is good=\r\n to keep in mind when designing such things.
