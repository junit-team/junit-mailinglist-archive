If I have 10 \n&gt; test cases in my junit batchtest..\n&gt; 10 jvms will come into picture.. I want this value to be available to \n&gt; all the jvms..\n\nI imagine the data is available for only the lifetime of the JVM.\n\nIs the value likely to change during the test run, between JVM \ninstances? Why? Perhaps that&#39;s something you want to test!\n\nI can immediately imagine running one Java process before running your \ntests that retrieve the system property, writes it to file, then your \ntests read from that file. This would help all 10 JVMs use the same \nvalue for that property. The first Java process could even generate a \nscript that would run your tests with the system property value fixed.\n\nGood luck.\n-- \nJ. B.
