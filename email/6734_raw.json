I can write tests for the rest of my applciation, \n&gt;how to I test connections to the db, and objects which use the db \n&gt;connections without having to run the websphere server?\n&gt;\n&gt;Thanks\n\nHello, Claire.\n\nWhat are you trying to test?\n\nDo you want to test whether you can connect to the database properly?\nThat can only be done by connecting to a live database. Any other way\nto test that feature wouldn&#39;t test what you want to test.\n\nDo you want to test whether connection pooling is enabled? There may be\nno way to test directly for this, but rather to use the WebSphere\nResource Analyzer to check that the number of connections created and\nreused is as expected. You would probably want to simulate some load on\nyour system OR you could write a simple app that asks for 1000\nconnections in 10 threads and see what happens.\n\nDo you want to test whether you use the database correctly? If you&#39;re\ntesting your JDBC code, then simply assert that you are generating the\ncorrect SQL statements and that you are cleaning up your result sets,\nstatements and connections, by using a mock connection, as others have\nsuggested.\n\nDo you want to test something else? Tell us and we&#39;ll provide more\nspecific advice.\n\nGood luck.\n\n\nJ. B.
