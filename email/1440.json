The most common objection I get <br/>\n&gt; goes along the line of &quot;what advantage will I get out of this, when <br/>\n&gt; writing my code? I have my test class, w/ its main(..) method, and <br/>\n&gt; that&#39;s all I need.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Even though people are willing to see the advantage of a unit testing <br/>\n&gt; framework for the long term project development, that want to see <br/>\n&gt; &quot;personal value&quot;.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>If they really did have a test class that gets run frequently and <br/>\nautomatically checks its results, then they would already be <br/>\nexperiencing the personal values - more time to write code with <br/>\nconfidence.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy experience has been that the personal value of time strikes a chord <br/>\nwith most developers.  It takes time to write the tests, but well <br/>\nfocused tests continue to pay a return on the investment by <br/>\nautomatically checking results and instilling confidence that adding new <br/>\nfeatures didn&#39;t break anything.  Without automated tests, your <br/>\ndevelopment pace suffers from the constant drag of having to manually <br/>\ninspect results with every code change.  It doesn&#39;t take long to realize <br/>\nthat the manual process doesn&#39;t scale particularly well.<br/>\n<br/>\nMike<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nMike Clark<br/>\nClarkware Consulting, Inc.<br/>\nCustom Software Architecture, Design,<br/>\nDevelopment, and Performance Consulting<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.clarkware.com\">http://www.clarkware.com</a></div>",
