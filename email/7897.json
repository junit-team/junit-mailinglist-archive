    "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-571699978\">Having a precompiled task that does exactly what you want it to is only part of the <br/>\nsolution.  When packaging for distribution, the sequence of steps is fixed and you <br/>\nrun through it once from start to finish.  ant is pretty good for this.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen developing, you need a wide range of dependency tracking to ensure you&#39;re <br/>\ndoing as little work as possible in response to any given change (this assumes <br/>\nyou&#39;re using the same framework to build for development as you do for distribution).  <br/>\nRapid changes in development are slowed down when you have to write code to <br/>\nsupport changes in your build process.  In this situation, make&#39;s dependencies and <br/>\nscript-level control are more well-suited.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnt expects all tasks to have dependencies implicitly encoded in the task itself, if you <br/>\nwant to avoid the overhead of invoking a certain task.  If I want to do simple <br/>\ndependency checking to avoid a custom task (using exec or an aggregate of tasks) if <br/>\nit&#39;s already been done, the solution with ant is verbose at best.<br/>\n<br/>\nThink of it as GUI vs programmatic API or script.  If everything you want to do is <br/>\nalready encoded in the GUI, that&#39;s great.  If not, then it&#39;s no better and sometimes <br/>\nworse than the alternatives.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;On Wed, 30 Apr 2003 03:43:33 +1200, J. B.
