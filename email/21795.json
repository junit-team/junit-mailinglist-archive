I would like to &quot;hijack&quot; this ecosystem for other<br/>\nlanguages/environments than Java. I actually did something for running<br/>\nJavascript tests with htmlunit and would now like to to do the same<br/>\nthing for C/C++ tests: use JUnit to drive and report test executions<br/>\nthat encapsulates native tests.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am no sure this is a good idea, but it kind of worked for my JS<br/>\ntests. For the C tests, I am confronted with an issue probably due to<br/>\nmy misunderstanding of JUnit architecture: It seems that Runner<br/>\ninstances need Class objects to work on, being passed them by the<br/>\nframework. But of course, in my particular case I do not have specific<br/>\nClass objects to work with as tests are written in native C/C++ code.<br/>\n<br/>\nCould somebody point me to the right direction, or give me some good<br/>\nreasons to forget about this ?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks<br/>\n<br/>\nArnaud</div>",
