I prefer to think in terms of the behavior of objects<br/>\n&gt; and methods, not in terms of (procedural) code branches.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; His first suggestion was to embed (in every method!) debug code that writes<br/>\n&gt; to a log and indicates that the method was executed.  I do not want to<br/>\n&gt; pollute my code with piles of:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; if (debug_mode) { SomeGlobalLogFile.write(&quot;this method happened&quot;) }<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Any ideas on how to assure him that exhaustive testing of every outcome of<br/>\n&gt; every public method will prove the system is working right?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This is a catch-22.  How can you prove to your project lead that your <br/>\nexisting test bed is exhaustive?  <br/>\n<br/>\nI, personally, would like this myself, not as a measure of correctness,<br/>\nbut as reassurance that I at least exercized everything at least once.<br/>\nIf I leave something untested, it will stand out in the metric as untested.<br/>\nIt may also point to unused/deprecated code which is a nuke candidate.<br/>\n<br/>\nI agree with your lead. ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nI haven&#39;t taken the time to glance at this more than briefly, but I<br/>\ncertainly don&#39;t consider conditional writes a useful solution.  I&#39;d go<br/>\nthe JProbe or profiler route using a JVM which supports it.<br/>\n<br/>\nHeck, look at Runtime.traceMethodCalls().  Find a JVM which does it,<br/>\nturn it on inside your test harness, and parse the logs afterwards.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJoi Ellis                    Software Engineer<br/>\nAravox Technologies          <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:joi@...\">joi@...</a>, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:gyles19@...\">gyles19@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\nNo matter what we think of Linux versus FreeBSD, etc., the one thing I<br/>\nreally like about Linux is that it has Microsoft worried.
