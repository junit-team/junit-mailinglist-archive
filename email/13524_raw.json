B. Rainsberger&quot; &lt;jbrains@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt; No, I had lost the context of the discussion. I\n&gt;&gt; would use DbUnit or the \n&gt;&gt; ORM, whichever was simpler. In your case, I&#39;d use\n&gt;&gt; the ORM.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; But, even better, I&#39;d use a fake (not a mock!) Data\n&gt;&gt; Repository layer \n&gt;&gt; when testing Business Logic without worrying about\n&gt;&gt; where in particular \n&gt;&gt; the data comes from.\n&gt; \n&gt; I agree. But what do you tell about integration\n&gt; testing? Some bugs will never show up if only mock\n&gt; objects are used. How do you catch them? Chapter 13\n&gt; doesn&#39;t seem to address our needs for integration\n&gt; testing.\n&gt; \n&gt; You only mention FIT very shortly in your book. Is\n&gt; this the ultimate solution for integration testing?\n&gt; \n&gt; What do you think about TestNG? I see that you don&#39;t\n&gt; mention it in your book.\n&gt; \n&gt; What do you say about test dependencies? In your book\n&gt; I only found a solution for ensuring that the tests\n&gt; are executed in a special order. But what about &quot;skip\n&gt; test y if test x failed&quot;? It reminds me of our batch\n&gt; programs: run batch y (which depends on results of\n&gt; batch x) only if batch x succeeded. Is there an addon\n&gt; for this for JUnit or a small and simple solution? Or\n&gt; should it not be done? In a way I agree with the\n&gt; author of TestNG that it would be nice to see 1 test\n&gt; passed, 1 test failed, 24 tests skipped instead of 1\n&gt; test passed and 25 tests failed.\n&gt; \n\nTestNG was just an idea at the moment the book was written. From that moment we went a long way ;-).\n\nI would say that TestNG dependency features are more appropriate to integration testing. These are\nsupported by the core of TestNG so you will not need to do advanced JUnit conf stuff to emulate this\nbehavior.\nHowever without these, TestNG can fit also the unit testing scenarios.\n\n:alex |.::the_mindstorm::.|\n--\nTestNG developer\n\n",
