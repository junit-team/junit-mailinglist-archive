I not too recently had to work with some legacy code. It was rather buggy and haphazardly tested, I was in a potential minefield, &quot;change something here and break something there&quot; ...kind of situation. \n\n    Since our QA dept was having a field day with issues ;-), I had no go but to bite the bullet and make changes. I also wrote JUnit tests around what ever functionality I added or modified. Of course I did break some code here and there, what I would do was build tests around those  and then fix them. It was initially a bit hectic not to mention messy at first. I don&#39;t want to sound like a commercial but what I have now are quite a bunch of tests in place that really help in detecting in most &#39;ripple effect&#39; bugs, and yes as a programmer it has really raised my confidence level in the robustness of the code. \n\nNext on my agenda is trying to structure the tests into a more organized manner and see if I can build tests around the non-tested portions -(ok my pipe dreams...but I hope to realize this soon).\n\nMy personal view from experience it&#39;s never too late to write those tests ;-), you&#39;ll really be glad you did. So while writing tests before coding is highly desirable, it doesn&#39;tmean you&#39;re locked out from writing tests for existing code.\n\n\nCheers !!\n\nGeorge\n\n \n\n----- Original Message ----- \n  From: Morten Grum, PH-Consult \n  To: junit@yahoogroups.com \n  Sent: Wednesday, February 26, 2003 7:58 PM\n  Subject: RE: [junit] Need help!!\n\n\n  The Unit test approach is &quot;write the test before the code&quot;.

Then there isn&#39;t any unit test approach.\n  Just stick to use-case tests.\n\n  Morten\n\n  &gt; -----Original Message-----\n  &gt; From: Sukhvinder Singh Namdhari [mailto:snamdhari@...]\n  &gt; Sent: 26. februar 2004 07:36\n  &gt; To: junit@yahoogroups.com\n  &gt; Subject: [junit] Need help!!\n  &gt;\n  &gt;\n  &gt; Hi,\n  &gt;\n  &gt; I have query regarding Unit Tests, I want to write unit tests for\n  &gt; my Server application, but till now we haven&#39;t wrote any testing\n  &gt; code, the application is ready and we are doing Smoke tests and\n  &gt; regression tests.
