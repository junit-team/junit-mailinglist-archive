This helps developers learn new skills (like test\ndevelopment), and i=\r\nt gives everyone a chance to see that the\nrecommended coding practices are =\r\nactively &#39;encouraged&#39; if not outright\n&#39;enforced&#39;.\n\nBelow is my writeup for =\r\na process that a friend of mine and I\ndeveloped after noticing that code re=\r\nviews for code written in a\npairing session were quite different than those=\r\n written alone.  We&#39;ve\nhad a great deal of success with this approach, as m=\r\neasured by the\ncontinuation of this process in projects after I&#39;ve left the=\r\nm, its\n*voluntary* adoption by other groups I&#39;m not involved with, and\nfina=\r\nlly a noticeable increase in the quality and coherence in our\ncode.  By qua=\r\nlity and coherence, I mean that when I as a team lead (or\nanother developer=\r\n) discuss a practice that isn&#39;t recommended, the\nother devs on the team are=\r\n able to see why, and we demonstrate what\nthe recommended approach is.\n\nWe&#39;=\r\nve used this practice to actually write quite a few tests,\nidentifying pote=\r\nntial problem areas in code review, and writing simple\ntests for them.  Tur=\r\nning questions like, &quot;does it handle...&quot; into unit\ntests becomes habit in c=\r\node review, and finally habitual in the\ndevelopment process.  And, it&#39;s qui=\r\nte a jackpot when you write a test\nin code review, and have it uncover a bu=\r\ng.  :)\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------=\r\n--\n\nCombining Code Review with Paired Programming:  \nAn approach by Kevin K=\r\nlinemeier and Charlie Sheppard\n\nThe first rule of the Code Review:  You don=\r\n&#39;t leave the code review\nwith more work to do.\nThe second rule of the Code =\r\nReview:  You don&#39;t leave the code review\nwith more work to do.\nThe third ru=\r\nle of the Code Review:  If this is your first time, you\nhave to ... uh... l=\r\nisten.  We&#39;re not that hardcore.\n\nCode reviews can be stressful, frustratin=\r\ng, and/or a waste of time. \nThis approach attempts to avoid at lot of that =\r\nby being more like a\npair programming session (with keyboard and projector)=\r\n than a review\nof a bunch of printed-out code.   Take a laptop with your fa=\r\nvorite IDE\nand the latest version of the codebase.  Sit down with a group o=\r\nf 3-5\ndevelopers and pick a few classes to review.\n\nAs you review a piece o=\r\nf code, rather than noting suggestions as tasks\nfor later (see rule #1), ac=\r\ntually make those changes to the codebase. \nIf they&#39;re too large to be made=\r\n in a single code review, pare the\nchange down to what you *can* do, and do=\r\n that.  At the end, check in\nyour changes and be done with it.\n\nThis approa=\r\nch tends to be much more interesting for the participants\nbecause there&#39;s m=\r\nore interaction, and is more productive because you\ncan see your changes ma=\r\nde as you suggest them.\n\nIt is important to be serious about the no-extra w=\r\nork rule.  This\nkeeps your developers from thinking, &quot;Ugh, we have to go to=\r\n an\nhour-long meeting from which I&#39;ll gain two more tasks to do this week.\n=\r\n Screw that, I don&#39;t have time.&quot;  Sacrifice your changes before you\nsacrifi=\r\nce the no-extra work clause.  Adding extra work in the review\ncauses the re=\r\nview to be skipped in &#39;crunch time&#39;, and ultimately lost\nalong the wayside.=\r\n\n\nIn general, when you start or amend your code review process, let your\nde=\r\nvelopers know that they should expect that they *will* find changes.\n Nobod=\r\ny is capable of keeping all the possible considerations in mind\nwhile they&#39;=\r\nre writing software.  That&#39;s why we do code reviews, and\nwhy paired program=\r\nming is so powerful.  Also, even if your software is\nvery, very well writte=\r\nn, you don&#39;t put several developers in a room\nand ask, &quot;Hey, what do you th=\r\nink of this piece of code?&quot; and get &quot;No\nchanges&quot; as a result.  It just does=\r\nn&#39;t happen.\n\nThe last thing, and this is obvious, but be polite.  There may=\r\n very\nwell be a reason the code is the way it is, or even if there isn&#39;t (i=\r\nt\nreally is that bad), it&#39;s likely the author and the rest of the team\nalre=\r\nady knows better.  Laugh at yourselves from time to time, and\noverall stay =\r\npositive.  Talk more about what can be fixed, rather than\nproblems left beh=\r\nind.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------=\r\n-----------------------\n\nOn 5/13/05, Danijel Arsenovski &lt;darsenovski@altec-=\r\nsantander.com&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Hi,\n&gt; \n&gt; I had some difficulty in promoting TDD in =\r\nmy team (if you can call it\n&gt; so, too many short-term body-shopped personne=\r\nl, with no TDD skills), so\n&gt; I started investigating some tools that permit=\r\n generating unit tests &quot;a\n&gt; posteriori&quot;.\n&gt; \n&gt; Would anyone like to share so=\r\nme experience with this type of tools,\n&gt; since they integrate better with t=\r\nraditional approach, contrary to\n&gt; &quot;write test first&quot;.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thank you,\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; Danijel Arsenovski\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been=\r\n removed]\n&gt; \n&gt; Yahoo!
