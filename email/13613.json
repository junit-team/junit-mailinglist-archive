In APIs I publish in class libraries, I worry about that; but in <br/>\ncode used by other code my team writes, I am less worried. As I often <br/>\nsay -- which I steal from others -- if I pass me null, the invoker is <br/>\nprobably broken, and not the invoked.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; However, if the problem id that they&#39;re tying you too much to the public<br/>\n&gt; parts of a class, then I suspect that&#39;s an indication that too much of<br/>\n&gt; the class is public.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Indeed... I prefer to use interface/implementation separation over <br/>\npublic/private separation. Funny thing: the more interface-rich my <br/>\ndesigns are, the less concern there is over too much of a class being <br/>\npublic, because collaborators rely on each other mostly through <br/>\nnarrowing interfaces.<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJ.
