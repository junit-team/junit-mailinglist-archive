But\n&gt;you should then let the error filter up the chain to be handled by the\n&gt;correct error handler, or even halt the JVM process if it comes to that.\n\nWell, you obviously aren&#39;t taking about a app server context. I agree with\nyou on a standalone app context. All of what you said is right in that\ncontext (at least I think so). Now imagine a server with 10 000 concurrent\nusers, using 200 features. Then one clicks on a button (rarely used buggy\nfeature). One user, one feature. That could possibly make the JVM exit and\nkick out all users? (of course you have clustering, but you still lost a\nserver).\n\n&gt;In this example, I would not catch Throwable, then.  I would catch\n&gt;NoClassDefFoundError.\n\nYeah, but the point is I don&#39;t know I&#39;m going to have a\nNoClassDefFoundError, else I would have a correct classpath / classloaders\nconfiguration in the first place! :)\nIt could be a UnsatisfiedLinkError (missing rarely used, not-loaded-yet\nlibrary), a ClassCircularityError (bad class) a VerifyError (disk\ncorruption), etc...\n\n&gt;The only place where I /may/ catch Throwable explicitly, is at the very\n&gt;top of the call stack (main(), or some run() method), where I log the\n&gt;error before gracefully shutting down, or start some other recovery\n&gt;strategy.  However, this should only be done when a recovery strategy is\n&gt;available.  What do you do in the case of an OutOfMemoryError? (There\n&gt;are several solutions to this problem, but I won&#39;t mention them here.)\n\nWell, if you don&#39;t catch, your server goes belly up and all sessions are\npossibly lost. Angry users.\nIf you catch and log, your staff is now aware of the problem and the server\nwill probably be able to still serve people a couple of minutes and let the\ntime to the staff to check the problem and possibly gracefully take that\nserver out of the loop.\n\nUsually when you have a correctly sized memory, a OOM will happend when a\nthread goes wild crazy. When the craziness is stopped by a OOM, you get the\nexception and all the crap the thread was using is released to the GC so you\nautomagically regain a lot of memory and everything is fine and dandy again.\nThen you get a monitoring alert, find out the huge stupid bug and patch it.\nBut the server stayed up and nobody except the one user noticed it (maybe\nthey saw a slowdow for 5 seconds).\n\nmathieu\n\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: Manuel Amago\nTo: junit@yahoogroups.com\nSent: Thursday, May 23, 2002 3:59 PM\nSubject: RE: [junit] catching Throwables (Was: Should JUnit determine if\nassert*/fail is called in testFoo?)\n\n\n&gt; same. Also, you might want to make that &quot;catch (Throwable t)&quot;\n\nI don&#39;t agree.  You should catch (&lt;exceptions declared in throw\nclause&gt;).\n\n&gt; On this point, does anybody here catches Throwables inside his code?\n\nI don&#39;t!\n\n&gt; I do. Even if not *supposed* to. Because when I &quot;try&quot;\n&gt; something, I want nothing to crap out except possibly that\n&gt; thing, and I want to know about it.\n\nYou could log it, so that you know a given problem has occurred, then\nyou could look at the resons that caused the error to fix the bug.  But\nyou should then let the error filter up the chain to be handled by the\ncorrect error handler, or even halt the JVM process if it comes to that.\n\n&gt; For exemple, if there is a classpath problem preventing me to\n&gt; do X(), I want to catch the NoClassDefFoundError, log the\n&gt; error, and invoke my recovery strategy (msg to user,\n&gt; alternate method, etc..), Not let the error go all the way to\n&gt; the top and possibly stop some important top-level task (or\n&gt; worse the entire jvm process).\n\nIn this example, I would not catch Throwable, then.  I would catch\nNoClassDefFoundError.\n\nThe only place where I /may/ catch Throwable explicitly, is at the very\ntop of the call stack (main(), or some run() method), where I log the\nerror before gracefully shutting down, or start some other recovery\nstrategy.  However, this should only be done when a recovery strategy is\navailable.  What do you do in the case of an OutOfMemoryError?
