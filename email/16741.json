Such testing is especially important in the <br/>\npresence of java generics -- you want to be sure that some data types, <br/>\nsuch as in method parameters, compile correctly, but others result in a <br/>\ncompile error.  Testing these cases by hand defeats the whole purpose of <br/>\nunit testing.<br/>\n<br/>\nIs there any way to test for a compile time error in a JUnit test?  Is <br/>\nthis something that would be impossible to add?<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a> wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; There are 5 messages in this issue.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Topics in this digest:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;    1.

How do you refactor to eliminate a dependency on<br/>\n&gt;&gt;member objects.

As a matter<br/>\n&gt; of fact, we brought Kent Beck on board as an Agitar Fellow a couple of<br/>\n&gt; years ago.  I also gave 2 JavaOne presentation on JUnit (not<br/>\n&gt; Agitator); one in 2004 and the last one just last week where I<br/>\n&gt; co-presented with Kent Beck himself.  Agitator takes full advantage of<br/>\n&gt; any existing JUnit tests and our Dashboard product is also fully<br/>\n&gt; integrated with JUnit.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; So, don&#39;t think in terms of JUnit vs. Agitator, but in terms of what<br/>\n&gt; can Agitator do to complement my JUnit and TDD efforts.  Of course, I<br/>\n&gt; believe it can do a lot - but I am hardly an impartial party :-).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; JUnit is great for TDD which, as some people noted, is more about<br/>\n&gt; design than testing.  It&#39;s also great for crafting very specific test<br/>\n&gt; cases where you can use your intuition and understanding of the domain<br/>\n&gt; space and implementation to cover interesting scenarios and sequences.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Agitator is great for exploratory testing, subjecting your code to all<br/>\n&gt; sorts of inputs - both valid and invalid - which helps you think about<br/>\n&gt; corner cases and conditions that you might have overlooked. It&#39;s also<br/>\n&gt; uniquely capable in discovering and enforcing class and method<br/>\n&gt; invariants (i.e. properties of the code that should *always* be true -<br/>\n&gt; as opposed to the more specific cases people typically write in JUnit).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Bottom line:  Think in terms of JUnit + Agitator and not JUnit vs.<br/>\n&gt; Agitator.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Thanks,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Alberto Savoia<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;davek725&quot; &lt;david.kissinger@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;&gt;My company is currently doing TDD and using JUnit for our unit <br/>\n&gt;&gt;testing - both persistence testing and business logic testing.  We <br/>\n&gt;&gt;are now looking at Agitator and trying to determine if, and how, it <br/>\n&gt;&gt;fits into our current practices.  I was wondering how others have <br/>\n&gt;&gt;decided to use Agitator (or not use it).  Some of the issues we are <br/>\n&gt;&gt;struggling with:<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;1.  Agitator looks like it can eliminate the need to write most JUnit <br/>\n&gt;&gt;tests (except true persistence testing).  The downside is that we <br/>\n&gt;&gt;would be left with only Agitator config files that contain our <br/>\n&gt;&gt;business logic assertions.  This seems like a big leap to take, given <br/>\n&gt;&gt;that if Agitar goes away, we have no JUnit.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;2.  Agitator mocks and factories look easy to create, but look like <br/>\n&gt;&gt;they are only useful in the context of Agitator.  I couldn&#39;t use them <br/>\n&gt;&gt;for other purposes (e.g. Fitnesse, JUnit).<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;3.  Having my business logic tests in JUnit means they are in an <br/>\n&gt;&gt;understood format and things such as inputs and expected results are <br/>\n&gt;&gt;clearly visible and grouped with each test.  My impression of <br/>\n&gt;&gt;Agitator is that this wouldn&#39;t be as clear.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Message 4 <br/>\n&gt;     From: &quot;albsavoia&quot; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:albsavoia@...\">albsavoia@...</a><br/>\n&gt;     Date: Sun May 28, 2006 10:24am(PDT) <br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: JUnit vs. Agitator<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; J.B.

This might or might not <br/>\n&gt;&gt;concern your team at this time.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; This is Alberto jumping in again to set the record straight on<br/>\n&gt; Agitator ...<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Hi Joe, you might not remember me but we exchanged emails a couple of<br/>\n&gt; years ago, and I am a big fan of yours for all the work you have done<br/>\n&gt; to educate people about JUnit through your book and online presence.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Anyway ... your description of using Agitator to complement TDD is<br/>\n&gt; spot-on (for people who do TDD) - thank you for jumping in and helping<br/>\n&gt; in setting the record straight.  But you also state (I paraphrase):<br/>\n&gt; &quot;Agitator does not help you identify design problems or motivate you<br/>\n&gt; to improve the design&quot;.  We have actually found, somewhat<br/>\n&gt; serendipitously, that Agitator does indeed help you in identifying<br/>\n&gt; design problems and even provides you compelling motivations to<br/>\n&gt; address them (e.g. well designed code Agitates better).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; A simple example, of Agitator helping you improve your design is<br/>\n&gt; blogged on developertesting.com:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.developertesting.com/archives/month200402/20040226-TestDrivenDevelopmentAndAgitatorDrivenRefactoring.html\">http://www.developertesting.com/archives/month200402/20040226-TestDrivenDevelopmentAndAgitatorDrivenRefactoring.html</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Again, this does not mean that Agitator replaces TDD, but it can<br/>\n&gt; complement TDD efforts (our own Dashboard product was developed<br/>\n&gt; practicing TDD, pair-programming, etc., AND Agitator of course).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Alberto<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Message 5 <br/>\n&gt;     From: &quot;Shane Mingins&quot; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:shane.mingins@...\">shane.mingins@...</a><br/>\n&gt;     Date: Sun May 28, 2006 1:14pm(PDT) <br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: JUnit vs. Agitator<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; On 5/27/06, albsavoia &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:albsavoia@...\">albsavoia@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;&gt;So, don&#39;t think in terms of JUnit vs. Agitator, but in terms of what<br/>\n&gt;&gt;can Agitator do to complement my JUnit and TDD efforts.

I get the impression that current thinking is that I could<br/>\n&gt; use Agitator instead of JUnit.  Now this may be correct  But I am wondering<br/>\n&gt; how correct?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; It could be correct in the same way that I could rub two sticks together<br/>\n&gt; instead of using matches or it could be correct in that I could use matches<br/>\n&gt; instead of a lighter.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Or do you see Agitator complementing JUnit in the same way whether you are<br/>\n&gt; using TTD or not?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; My current thinking is the two tools solve slightly different problems ...<br/>\n&gt; or they address testing is different ways.  An example that comes to mind is<br/>\n&gt; in the Agitator tutorial.  In reaching full agitation the observation that<br/>\n&gt; the length of product name is less than 20 revealed a bug.  But as I saw<br/>\n&gt; that I thought ... but if I had a JUnit test testing the boundaries of name<br/>\n&gt; as specified would have been tested and that mistake highlighted<br/>\n&gt; immediately.  Anyhow at the moment I am thinking that developers should<br/>\n&gt; start with JUnit or JUnit + Agitator and not simply just Agitator.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Your thoughts?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Thanks<br/>\n&gt; Shane<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Yahoo!
