I believe the class I&#39;m trying to <br/>\n&gt; test will be extending Applet, if that helps.  As far as which <br/>\n&gt; JavaScript environment...not sure I understand what you mean by <br/>\nthat, <br/>\n&gt; but I&#39;ll probably be targeting IE 5.5+ and NS 6.0+ as far as <br/>\nbrowser <br/>\n&gt; compatibility goes.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; As to which JSUnit I downloaded...I didn&#39;t know there were that <br/>\n&gt; many...I&#39;ll have to go take a look at them. :)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Thanks,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -Eric<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --- In junit@y..., &quot;Schaible, Jorg&quot; &lt;joerg.schaible@g...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Hi Eric,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Has anyone written unit tests trying to use the <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; netscape.javascript.JSObject?  I&#39;ve been poking around, but <br/>\n&gt; haven&#39;t <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; found a good way to create one containing the values I want.  <br/>\nOf <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; course they would just *HAVE* to make it final, so I couldn&#39;t <br/>\n&gt; extend <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; it. :p<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I have downloaded the latest JSUnit, so if that&#39;s the route I <br/>\n&gt; will <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; have to take, just let me know.  And, if you&#39;ve used JSUnit to <br/>\n&gt; write <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; tests for a class using JSObject, please drop me some hints. :)<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Can you describe exactly what you want to test and which <br/>\nJavaScript<br/>\n&gt; &gt; environment you use? Also *which* JsUnit did you consider? <br/>\n&gt; Xprogramming.com<br/>\n&gt; &gt; lists 4 different.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Regards,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Jorg </span></blockquote></div>",
