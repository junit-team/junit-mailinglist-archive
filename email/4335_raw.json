I\nunderstand that there&#39;s a work-around to exclude these classes however, I\nbeginning to wonder if it is adequate to require this work-around. The sheer\nnumber of problems I see with the class loader leads me to think that:\n\n1. This issue is not clearly documented.\n2. This is likely due to poorly written code. I don&#39;t have any experience\nwith custom class loaders but my gut tells me that there&#39;s got to be a\nbetter way to do this.\n\nPerhaps this issue has already been discussed in the developers&#39; list but I\nthink we need an explanation for why this problem has not (or can not) be\nfixed here as well. For instance, it seems to me that we could catch these\nerrors instead of letting them fall through and stop the execution of the\napplication.\n\nThoughts? Comments? Flames?\n\nChris Eppstein\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: Peter Spitz [mailto:pspitz@...]\nSent: Wednesday, March 13, 2002 10:43 AM\nTo: &#39;junit@yahoogroups.com&#39;\nSubject: RE: [junit] LOADER CONSTRAINTS VIOLATED\n\n\nRomilson,\n\nSearch the message archive of this mailing list for &quot;loader constraints\nviolated&quot;.
