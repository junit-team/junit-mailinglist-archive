It would also not rub me the wrong way if it\nwas not he case that code that is written in a TDD manner turns out to be\ntestable pretty much by definition.\n\nPerhaps when I feel that I do something &quot;just for testing&quot; it is a good idea\nfor me to reflect upon if there is some way that I can achieve the\ntestability with other benefits as well. Perhaps now is not a good time to\nreflect so I write a note to myself to get back to the problem and reflect\nlater.\n\nThe whole testing private methods discussion would never rub me the wrong\nway either if I didn&#39;t feel that we chose to resort to technical voodoo in\norder to avoid changing how we generally approach problems and IMO are more\nor less guaranteed to miss out on an oportunity to learn.\n\nThe &quot;its not agile&quot; argument always rubs me the wrong way because it&#39;s\npointless. Frankly I don&#39;t care about being agile unless it works better\nthan something else I would be doing.\n\nI do the things I do because I know no better way of doing them right now.\nIf I could do less testing I would, since having lots of tests is also quite\npointless in itself. It is the effects of having them that I am after. Or\nseemingly it is the effect of writing them that I am after. I write lots of\ntests because I know no better way of ensuring that my code has quality and\nof driving me to reflect daily about design that helps me improve as a\nprogrammer.\n\nIf the point was lots of coverage and exercise every single method as a unit\nI would probably make all methods public... but it&#39;s not...\n\nBy the way, I have come to find that the private keyword is pretty overrated\n:)\n\nSorry for the rant... I just need to do that at least once every year :)\nAnyone is free to disagree and it may very well be because they are smarter\nor better programmers than I am. If there is anything worth reflecting on in\nwhat I wrote then it would be &quot;don&#39;t follow the rules, go after the effects&quot;\n/J\n-----------------------------------------------------\nJoakim Ohlrogge\nTwitter: @johlrogge\nBlog: johlrogge.wordpress.com\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n",
