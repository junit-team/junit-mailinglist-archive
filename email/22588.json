I&#39;m trying to run junit via eclipse.  Every tutorial I&#39;ve seen says to JUnit to the build path, and then I should be able to go to &quot;New&quot; -&gt; &quot;JUnit Testcase&quot; (or perhaps have to go to &quot;Other&quot; first).  I can add it to the build path, but I don&#39;t get a New type I can select.  Also when I&#39;m supposed to be able to go to &quot;Show View&quot; -&gt; &quot;Other&quot; and select &quot;JUnit&quot;, it is not present.<br/>\n<br/>\nSounds like I&#39;ve not installed something.  I do have this:<br/>\nC:&#92;Program Files&#92;eclipse&#92;plugins&#92;org.junit_3.8.2.v20090203-1005<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I also downloaded and placed junit-4.8.1.jar in that same dir.<br/>\n<br/>\nI can run kinda get unit to run from the &quot;Run&quot; menu, but it is awkward.  Any tips on how to properly get this configured?</div>",
