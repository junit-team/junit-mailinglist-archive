You must carefully\n    create the unit tests performed by JUnit to ensure\n    that the tests rigorously check the code just as it\n    would run in the real world. In this article, we first\n    look at how to create unit tests and then at how to put\n    together test suites.\n\nMaybe I&#39;m being overly sensitive but it almost sounds like\n&quot;Here is a complicated thing that I&#39;m going to explain to you&quot;\nrather than &quot;Creating GOOD test cases is always tough. JUnit\nhelps by giving a framework where all you have to think about\nis what you want to test...&quot;\n\n&lt;/vent&gt;\n\nRichard.\n\n\n\n",
