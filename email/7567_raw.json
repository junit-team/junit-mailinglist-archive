Thats a lot.\n\nBesides this, JTest is much more powerful in testing capabilities.\n\nAnd using DbC, you have a nice documentation by the way, of much \nmore value\nthan cumbersome, knotty and unnatural test code.\n\nI still have to examine both of them, the free JUnit and the \ncommercial \nJTest.\n\nI&#39;m still open, but I favor DbC based solutions for testing at this\npoint.\n\n\n\n",
