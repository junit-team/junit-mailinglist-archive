As you rightf=\r\nully point out\nin your message below, this mailing-list is comprised of exp=\r\nerts who have a\ngood grasp of the compromises involved in making such decis=\r\nions, and if one\nof them decides that there is some potential to be gained =\r\nby exposing a\nprotected method, they should follow their instinct and go ah=\r\nead, even if\nthat potential is unseen at the time of writing and, more impo=\r\nrtantly, even\nif it goes again the Agile Principles.\n\nThat&#39;s called intuiti=\r\non, and listening to it once in a while is a duty,\nalong with questioning a=\r\nbsolute statements such as &quot;YAGNI&quot;.\n\n--\nCedric\nhttp://testng.org\n\n\n\nOn 11/2=\r\n/05, Elliotte Rusty Harold &lt;elharo@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; C=C3=A9dric =\r\nBeust =E2=99=94 wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; You don&#39;t know that, because you never heard f=\r\nrom them. And for all you\n&gt; &gt; know, all these potential users chose to use =\r\na different library than\n&gt; yours\n&gt; &gt; because they had more freedom there.\n&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; Perhaps, but I don&#39;t think so. I not only pay pretty close attention to\n=\r\n&gt; what users are asking me. I listen to what users are asking from my\n&gt; com=\r\npetition. (fringe benefit of open source and open development).\n&gt; Unless th=\r\ney&#39;re a lot of people working on their own XML frameworks in\n&gt; their baseme=\r\nnts, there&#39;s just not that much need for extending the\n&gt; framework beyond w=\r\nhat I provide. Even in frameworks that allow a lot\n&gt; more extensibility of =\r\nthis type (DOM comes to mind) people don&#39;t\n&gt; actually seem to take advantag=\r\ne of that possibility.\n&gt;\n&gt; Inheritance is vastly overrated. The number of p=\r\neople who actually want\n&gt; to change a class&#39;s behavior is extremely small i=\r\nn most cases.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; And even if you could know this number for sure, just=\r\n accept that other\n&gt; &gt; people have different experiences than you do (among=\r\n which, most of the\n&gt; &gt; people who are participating in this thread, it see=\r\nms).\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Actually, I&#39;d turn that back on you. Different people have diffe=\r\nrent\n&gt; experiences and different needs, but these experiences and needs are=\r\n not\n&gt; equal in numbers or importance. The programmers who hang out on mail=\r\ning\n&gt; lists like this one (especially this one) are a very highly\n&gt; self-se=\r\nlected group. They are in many ways much more theoretically and\n&gt; abstractl=\r\ny inclined than 90% of working developers. Most programmers who\n&gt; write boo=\r\nks about programming and who design and publish libraries are\n&gt; really way =\r\nbeyond the typical working developer. Not a surprise: some\n&gt; programmers ar=\r\ne experts in programming and some are experts in insurance\n&gt; or financial d=\r\nerivatives or shock wave modeling or something else. We\n&gt; can&#39;t all be expe=\r\nrts in everything. But these mailing lists attract the\n&gt; meta-programmers: =\r\nthe programmers who are experts in programming.\n&gt;\n&gt; Guess what? We&#39;re weird=\r\n, even among programmers. We are much more\n&gt; comfortable with abstraction t=\r\nhan even other typical programmers. Design\n&gt; patterns, factory methods, int=\r\nerfaces, inheritance, polymorphism, and\n&gt; anything beyond simple data encap=\r\nsulation is way beyond the comfort\n&gt; level of most actual programmers. A li=\r\nbrary designed for ease of use by\n&gt; a typical programmer needs to focus on =\r\nthe 90% rather than the 10%. If\n&gt; you gauge the audience for a tool by the =\r\nprogrammers who hang out in\n&gt; forums like this one, you&#39;re going to miss th=\r\ne vast body of programmers\n&gt; who don&#39;t.\n&gt;\n&gt; What you are in effect arguing =\r\nis that you don&#39;t want to be held back by\n&gt; the needs of the many. You can =\r\nsafely use extra extension points, and\n&gt; therefore they should be there. Bu=\r\nt most programmers don&#39;t feel this\n&gt; way. Most of them can at least safely =\r\nignore the extra methods. They\n&gt; probably won&#39;t shoot themselves in the foo=\r\nt even if we give them plenty\n&gt; of bullets. However the sheer complexity of=\r\n adding all these extra\n&gt; extension points make the classes so much harder =\r\nto use that the cost to\n&gt; the many outweighs the benefits to the few.\n&gt;\n&gt; S=\r\nometimes we do need subclassing and extra extension points, but not\n&gt; that =\r\nmany and not that often; even when considering only the most\n&gt; abstractly i=\r\nnclined of programmers. Extension points are not without\n&gt; cost. There&#39;s is=\r\n or should be a significant hurdle to be jumped before\n&gt; adding a new publi=\r\nshed method. Even if the method is inherently useful\n&gt; and has no correspon=\r\nding problems, it still needs to be useful enough.\n&gt; It&#39;s not enough that o=\r\nne or a few people might use a method. It needs to\n&gt; be pretty clear that l=\r\narge percentage of a library&#39;s users are going to\n&gt; take advantage of the f=\r\neature, or that it be extremely important to a\n&gt; smaller but still sizeable=\r\n percentage.\n&gt;\n&gt; We can argue about exactly where to put the line: how usef=\r\nul to how many\n&gt; people does a method need to be before we add it. However =\r\nthat number is\n&gt; quite a bit higher then 1. It is certainly higher than 0. =\r\nThat a feature\n&gt; might someday be used by someone, but we aren&#39;t quite sure=\r\n who or when,\n&gt; is not sufficient grounds to include it. There needs to be =\r\na positive\n&gt; decision that a feature will be useful before it&#39;s added.
