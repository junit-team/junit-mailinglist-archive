I&#39;m feeling quite the fuddy-duddy on this, though.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; If I have a supporting database that I need to load from an SQL dump, <br/>\n&gt; and then want to run 20 different tests using it, it&#39;s not a very <br/>\n&gt; palatable option to needlessly reload the databsae 20 times instead of 1.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I agree I&#39;m taking liberties with the definition of a _unit_ test by <br/>\n&gt; doing so, but when dealing with legacy code and legacy testsuites, <br/>\n&gt; sometimes a philosophically-impure test is better than no test at all.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Max.<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>",
