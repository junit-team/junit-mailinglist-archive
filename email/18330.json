Of course, Java makes 100%<br/>\n&gt; reliability impossible, but it would seem that examining the classpath<br/>\n&gt; could<br/>\n&gt; allow some magic to be worked.  It would also seem the kind of problem<br/>\n&gt; that<br/>\n&gt; someone out there may have already solved.  Anyone have a pointer?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nTestNG has code that does that (you can basically specify &#39;run all the<br/>\nclasses in the package &quot;com.foo.mytests&quot;&#39;, and we even support wildcards).<br/>\nNot sure where your 80% figure comes from, because I can promise you it<br/>\nworks 100% of the time (even though it relies on a few things that are only<br/>\nloosely documented in the ClassLoader API).<br/>\n<br/>\nFeel free to grab the code.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nCédric<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed] </span></blockquote></div>",
