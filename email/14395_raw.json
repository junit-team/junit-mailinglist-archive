I use Eclipse (for\n&quot;interactive&quot; test runs) and ant (for continuous integration tests,\netc.) and have never used the GUI test runner even once.  I don&#39;t feel\nlike I&#39;m missing anything.  If people like to have a GUI test runner,\nhow about making one and putting it in the JUnit add-ons area of\njunit.org?\n \n \nTodd.\n\n\n________________________________\n\n\tFrom: junit@yahoogroups.com [mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com] On\nBehalf Of Clarke, Andrew\n\tSent: Monday, August 22, 2005 2:50 AM\n\tTo: junit@yahoogroups.com\n\tSubject: RE: [junit] Some questions about JUnit 4\n\t\n\t\n\tWas I the only person to be saddened by this announcement?\nMaybe I&#39;m\n\tjust being sentimental here but the Graphical TestRunner&#39;s green\nbar/red\n\tbar was one of the earliest delights of Junit.\n\t\n\tBesides, as a casual user of Java I have yet to find the energy\nto learn\n\tan IDE.  When I do have to code Java I generally use my normal\ntext\n\teditor and the graphical test runner, which I find is quicker\nand easier\n\tto use than the text version.\n\t\n\tI know Kent has an evangelising streak - automated unit testing,\n\txp/agile, etc - which he has used well in the service of the\nsoftware\n\tcommunity but I think insisting on the use of an IDE is a\ncrusade too\n\tfar.\n\t\n\tCheers, APC\n\t\n\t-----Original Message-----\n\tFrom: junit@yahoogroups.com [mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com] On\nBehalf Of\n\tKent Beck\n\tSent: 18 August 2005 17:07\n\tTo: junit@yahoogroups.com\n\tSubject: RE: [junit] Some questions about JUnit 4\n\t\n\tElliotte,\n\t\n\tThank you for the offer, but we are fairly certain that we do\nnot want\n\tto include the graphical runners in JUnit 4. I can see that they\nmight\n\tbe useful in a teaching situation, but we are assuming that an\nIDE will\n\talways be available or that the textual interface will suffice.\n\t\n\tSincerely yours,\n\t\n\tKent Beck\n\tThree Rivers Institute \n\t\n\t\n\t\n\tThis e-mail and any attachment is for authorised use by the\nintended recipient(s) only.
