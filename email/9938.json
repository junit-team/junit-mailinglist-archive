When I&#39;m <br/>\nwriting production code, and I want to remember how to do string <br/>\nindexing, the test contains examples of the all the indexing things I&#39;m <br/>\nable to do with a string.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf testIndexing() grows uncomfortably big, for example, then I&#39;ll break <br/>\nit into individual test case methods.  I know it&#39;s too big if I find <br/>\nmyself having to wade through too many examples to find the one example <br/>\nI&#39;m looking for.  For example, I might end up with <br/>\ntestIndexingByCharacter and testIndexingByString.  That effectively <br/>\ncuts the example search in half, providing I know whether I&#39;m working <br/>\nwith characters or strings.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut that&#39;s just what works for me.<br/>\n<br/>\nMike</div>",
