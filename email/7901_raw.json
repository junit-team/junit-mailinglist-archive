Is the expectation that the error message should give all \nthe information necessary to identify the bug?\n\nOr is it expected that the developer have knowledege of (or discover) \nwhat the test is doing? or run the test in debug mode? or other?\n\nWe are testing methods that take xml Strings as parameters and return \nxml. It would be nice to see what was passed in and what was returned \nif anything .. even when something like a NullPointerException is \nfailing the test. Also we are running the tests in different \nenvironments so a developer may not see the same error if they run \nthe test in the development environment.\n\nIs a separate logging mechanism the answer?\n\nThanks in advance for any pointers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
