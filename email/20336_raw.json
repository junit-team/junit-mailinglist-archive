I have  \n&gt; found\n&gt; &gt; through years of practice that end-to-end tests are ineffective at\n&gt; &gt; finding integration defects caused by incorrect understanding of the\n&gt; &gt; contract between pairs of objects.\n&gt;\n&gt; Interesting.\n&gt; I thought end to end tests would be more likely to find integration\n&gt; defects, though I agree they may not be the most efficient way.\n&gt;\nIt&#39;s only my opinion, but what I observe teams writing some end-to-end  \ntests, but not nearly enough, and finding some integration defects,  \nbut not nearly enough. In particular, they have, say, 30 instances of  \nthe same integration defect--effectively duplicates--and find about 25  \nof them. They don&#39;t know the other 5 are lurking until a customer  \npoints it out.\n\nI believe that the less we rely on end-to-end tests, the less we&#39;d  \nallow ourselves to duplicate high-level structures, and therefore the  \nfewer integration defects we&#39;d have. This would make end-to-end tests  \nall the less valuable.\n&gt; &gt; I use a design technique based on\n&gt; &gt; collaboration tests and contract tests that drive out integration\n&gt; &gt; defects without integration tests, but it took me a few years of TDD\n&gt; &gt; practice before I felt comfortable with the technique. It&#39;s not for\n&gt; &gt; beginners.\n&gt;\n&gt; Did you write that up in a blog or article and do you have a link for\n&gt; that?\n&gt; You could protect it with a TDD adult check somehow so that  \n&gt; beginners are\n&gt; protected from TDD-adult only content...\n&gt;\nI haven&#39;t written it up in that fashion yet, in part because I feel  \nlike I&#39;d mostly be duplicating content from mockobjects.com and I  \ndon&#39;t see the point in duplicating work that I know exists. That said,  \nI describe the technique as the centerpiece of my Test-Driven  \nEnterprise Code tutorials (Agile 2005-2006, XP 2006-2007, various  \nother conferences) and it would be a TDD clinic if Agile 2008 accepts  \nit.\n\nSomeday, I&#39;ll write it in a book. Maybe.\n\nTake care.\n----\nJ. B.
