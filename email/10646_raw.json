I think this is what \n&gt; Paraso=\r\nft JTest already does.\n&gt; \n&gt; Don&#39;t misunderstand me. I like JUnit. But I alw=\r\nays look for better \n&gt; ways to solve my problems. So I hope you are as open=\r\n as me to new \n&gt; solutions and ideas.\n\nI will say only this: if by any reas=\r\non you find that DBC suits your\npreferences/needs better than unit testing =\r\nuse it.
