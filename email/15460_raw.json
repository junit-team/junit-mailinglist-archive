If all &quot;complicated&quot;\n&gt; would be like that we can get 200% test coverage...\n&gt; \n&gt;    You came to the right conclusion that SQLException is an\n&gt; unrecoverable one and should be wrapped into a runtime exception. You\n&gt; even have slight improvement there with a common exception handler.\n&gt; There is only one step left before template pattern, so you can have\n&gt; exactly one place where that exception handler would be used. Take a\n&gt; look at JDBC packages in a Spring framework and either copy its design\n&gt; or use as is.\n&gt; \n&gt;    Pretty much the same pattern can be applied to other common API&#39;s and\n&gt; many already in a very same Spring framework, so you won&#39;t have to\n&gt; invent the wheel.\n&gt; \n&gt;    As I said, there are really good ways to make code more testable.\n\nI agree that we can improve things with the Template pattern, but I&#39;d\nneed a template for JDBC, for JMS, ... for every different 3rd-party\nproduct I use. Even if I do that, I still need to test-drive the\ntemplate, or hide the template behind an interface so I can test-drive\nthe code that uses it. I suppose it is achievable, but I&#39;m not sure it&#39;s\nworth the effort.\n\nIf Java made the syntax for anonymous code blocks nicer, then I suppose \nthis wouldn&#39;t be a problem. What I find is that when I try to use the \nTemplate pattern on projects, most of the people around me don&#39;t like it \nor don&#39;t understand it, even though it&#39;s quite natural to me.\n-- \nJ.
