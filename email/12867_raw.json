I was trying to be funny, and it looks like I failed.\n \nTo answer your specific question, there have been times in my career\nwhere it hasn&#39;t been commercially desirable to improve design.  Usually,\nimproving design takes some amount of time and effort.  Sometimes, the\ncosts of that improvement exceed the value of the improved design.  In\nthose cases, we&#39;ve made the right business decision to NOT improve the\nproduct&#39;s design.\n \nTo tie this back to JUnit, having a good test suite always decreases the\ncost of improving design.\n \n \nTodd.\n \n \n \n\n\n________________________________\n\n\tFrom: Soaring Eagle [mailto:comfortable.numb@...] \n\tSent: Tuesday, February 15, 2005 12:02 PM\n\tTo: junit@yahoogroups.com\n\tSubject: Re: [junit] Testing certain types of methods\n\t\n\t\n\tTodd,\n\t\n\tI dont see the &quot;bad&quot; connotation in the text of my email.\nAnyways -\n\there is the question repeated.\n\t\n\tDo you mean that sometimes it is not commercially desirable to\n\timprovde design and at such times, JUnit&#39;s inability to be\nflexible is\n\ta limitation?\n\t\n\tGroup,\n\t\n\tI guess I understand what this thread means, but if anyone wants\nto\n\tconfirm it, that will be good too.\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n",
