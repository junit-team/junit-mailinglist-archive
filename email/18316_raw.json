I&#39;d like to create a junit ant task that\njust runs on my whole cod=\r\nebase, but not all of my classes will have\ntest methods and I&#39;ll get an err=\r\nor for each class that doesn&#39;t (and I\ndon&#39;t want to have to explictily add =\r\neach class to my build.xml file\nwhen I add a test).
