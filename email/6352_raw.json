Off late, I have been getting the following error that\n&gt; causes my tests to fail, that is, this error is generated during the\n&gt; execution of my tests. A typical scenario is that first 6 test run\n&gt; fine, and the seventh test has this problem which makes the test to\n&gt; fail. And all the following tests fail as well.\n&gt; \n&gt; [java] #\n&gt; \n&gt; [java] # HotSpot Virtual Machine Error, Internal Error\n&gt; \n&gt; [java] # Please report this error at\n&gt; \n&gt; [java] # http://java.sun.com/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi\n&gt; \n&gt; [java] #\n&gt; \n&gt; [java] # Error ID: 47454E45524154452F4F502D41500E4350500842\n&gt; \n&gt; [java] #\n&gt; \n&gt; [java] # Problematic Thread: prio=5 tid=0x8a44e68 nid=0x6c0 runnable\n&gt; \n&gt; [java] #\n&gt; \n&gt; [java] Java Result: 1\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; Any suggestions.\n&gt; \n&gt; TIA,\n&gt; \n&gt; Vikas\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; Catch all the cricket action.
