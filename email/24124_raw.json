With a matcher I=\r\n&#39;m going to get told that object\ndon&#39;t match with a full list of fields tha=\r\nt do and do not match - and\nsurely everyone checks their test diagnostics b=\r\nefore making a test pass?\n\n2) I write a test that overrides equals based on=\r\n all the fields in the\nobject and I make it go green and all is good with t=\r\nhe world.  A\nrequirement comes in meaning that I want equals to only match =\r\non a single\nfield (Id or something like that), my tests of course still pas=\r\ns.  I then\ngo and make a change to some code so that checking all fields wo=\r\nuld fail\nthe test, but only using the equals method means it passes.\n\nOn Tu=\r\ne, Nov 20, 2012 at 12:01 PM, halfpirate1210\n&lt;bell_beauty12@...&gt;wrot=\r\ne:\n\n&gt; **\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi zodiaczx6\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;m a little curious; can you please tell m=\r\ne why you&#39;re against doing such\n&gt; for tests?\n&gt;\n&gt; Cheers,\n&gt; halfpirate1210\n&gt;=\r\n\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In junit@yahoogroups.com, Colin Vipurs &lt;zodiaczx6@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; You&#39;ll need to override equals (and by definition hashCode) on the\n&gt; ob=\r\njects in your array. I generally advise against doing this purely for\n&gt; tes=\r\nts and instead look at implementing your own hamcrest matcher.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; On N=\r\nov 17, 2012, at 7:39 PM, &quot;halfpirate1210&quot; &lt;bell_beauty12@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; Hello.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Newbie here.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I created a class (let&#39;s sa=\r\ny class A) and in my JUnit class, I created\n&gt; an object (let&#39;s say object A=\r\n1) from class A. Object A1 contains several\n&gt; variables and most importantl=\r\ny, an array of objects which are instantiated\n&gt; from another class (let&#39;s s=\r\nay class B); so the elements in that array are\n&gt; objects, not data types li=\r\nke int, string, etc.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; So I wanted to test this array of objects =\r\nwith another array of\n&gt; objects by simply creating another object; A2 from =\r\nclass A. I wanted to\n&gt; test using assertArrayEquals and the result is red b=\r\nar.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; So my question is why did the test fail? I&#39;m thinking proba=\r\nbly objects\n&gt; are always different since they are based on reference? But t=\r\nhen again\n&gt; assertArrayEquals checks array length and content.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nMany thanks,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; halfpirate1210\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; [Non-text portion=\r\ns of this message have been removed]\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\n\n\n-- \nMaybe she awoke to =\r\nsee the roommate&#39;s boyfriend swinging from the\nchandelier wearing a boar&#39;s =\r\nhead.\n\nSomething which you, I, and everyone else would call &quot;Tuesday&quot;, of c=\r\nourse.\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n",
