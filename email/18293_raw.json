The majority of the behaviour you are developing can be\nand should be ignorant of wheter it runs in an applicationserver or not. For\nsystem tests there is Cactus and MockEJB. I&#39;m not convinced that it is a\ngood idea to use those frameworks. I never felt had the need.\n\nI think in those cases deploy your application and run your tests as a\nclient. Perhaps using FIT or some other acceptance-testing framework. Those\ntests are typically run more seldomly than your unit-tests.\n\nThis is just my opinion on a way forward. I&#39;m sure those who disagree will\nspeak up soon :)\n\nOn 11/2/06, lenniedg2000 &lt;lenniedg@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;   Hi,\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;m using Eclipse 3.2, Orion application server, J2EE 5.0, Oracle\n&gt; database.\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;ve written a jUnit test but it doesn&#39;t run since it doesn&#39;t run\n&gt; within the application server &quot;container&quot; and so can&#39;t find the\n&gt; database data-sources that I&#39;ve setup.\n&gt;\n&gt; How can I run jUnit unit tests inside an application server &quot;container&quot;?\n&gt;\n&gt; Kind Regards,\n&gt;\n&gt; Lennie De Villiers\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n",
