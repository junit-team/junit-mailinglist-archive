So, this example just goes to show that multiple<br/>\n    &gt; reporting might be helpful in some circumstances. <br/>\n    &gt; Obviously not all,<br/>\n    &gt; and quite possibly not useful enough for the sizeable and <br/>\n    &gt; challenging<br/>\n    &gt; framework change required to support it.<br/>\n <br/>\n </span></blockquote>How would this complete list help you any more than the simple fact that the<br/>\narrays were not of the same length?  Given that I expected them to contain<br/>\nthe same number of elements, the most valuable information to me would be<br/>\nthat they were of different lengths, not which elements were/were not<br/>\npresent.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as what someone else said about working in batch mode, I submit that<br/>\ntrying to fix more than one problem at a time (no matter how good you are)<br/>\nresults in more headaches than trying to fix one at a time.  Some may<br/>\ndisagree...  Even though JUnit users are not all XPers, it is still a good<br/>\npractice to do the simplest thing that could possibly work, and build from<br/>\nthere -- especially when trying to fix tests!<br/>\n<br/>\nRespectfully,<br/>\n-Jason</div>",
