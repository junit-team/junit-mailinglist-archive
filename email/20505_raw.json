They have all been to a TDD\n&gt; course but for a variety of reasons didn&#39;t learn enough to pick up the\n&gt; habit. The developers all think that TDD is a worthy idea but don&#39;t\n&gt; know enough to practice it day to day.\n&gt;\n&gt; To make this worthwhile I think we need a more interesting example\n&gt; than the typical factorial example and a location that encourages\n&gt; pairing. I could start with the team&#39;s existing code and tasks but I\n&gt; think we would spend a lot of time on non-trivial edge cases without\n&gt; really hitting TDD. Instead I think I will offer to pair with people\n&gt; to tackle these problems.\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;m looking for any and all ideas, but have some specific questions:\n&gt; - What example would you use? Brian Marick had mentioned one:\n&gt; http://www.exampler.com/blog/2007/06/26/a-workbook-for-practicing-test-driven-design-draft/\n&gt; but the downloads are broken.\n&gt; - Do you have an example that would demonstrate any of these difficult\n&gt; issues: abstracting the database, test driving bits of the GUI?\n&gt; - Do you have good examples to help demonstrate Test Driven\n&gt; Refactoring aka Michael Feathers and Legacy code.\n&gt; - Would you go off site? They don&#39;t have a team room yet.\n&gt; - Would a boardroom setup work well to encourage pairing?\n&gt; - How long would you make the session? Half day? Full day?\n&gt;\n&gt; What would you do?\n&gt;\nI would ask the team whether they want to work on a real feature in  \norder to learn TDD. If they do, then iteration 1 is building something  \nsimple that runs in memory and focuses on the mechanics of TDD and a  \nfew of the early hiccups. Start with something that involves a handful  \nof objects working together. I use an example in my &quot;Architecture  \nWithout Trying&quot; demo that shows MVC/MVP emerging without my pushing in  \nthat direction, but simply by paying attention to duplication and  \nnames. The entire demo takes maybe 2 hours.\n\nAfter they practice for a while, I offer to spend an hour doing the  \nsame demo, but Presenter-First style, designing the Model and View  \ninterfaces, usually using a dynamic mock framework. This takes about  \nan hour.\n\nSo I would definitely expect to take an entire day. If you can  \nidentify a small feature that involves displaying data from a model,  \nthen you can do Architecture Without Trying and it might really  \nimpress them.\n\nIn between the demos, ask them to TDD something--anything--and check  \nin with them every 40 minutes or so. By letting them choose, they get  \nto learn what they need to learn at the moment they need it. After 40  \nminutes, spend 10 minutes answering questions or sharing tips and  \ntricks related to observations you made about their progress: common  \nquestions, that kind of thing. Then give them a 10-minute break.  \nRepeat this hour as much as needed.\n\nAs for offsite/onsite, do whatever it takes to give them room to be  \ncomfortable, space to work in pairs, and have a whiteboard or  \nflipchart handy.\n\nI hope that helps you.\n\nTake care.\n----\nJ.
