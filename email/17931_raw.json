Thank you, that was useful. I have to remember that\nto see if I agree that it is the magic formula for simplicity.\n\nI do think that simple is often mistaken for easy. Simple is usually easy if\nyou know the tools. If you have to learn the tools to achieve simple then\nsomething /less simple/ may be /easier/\n(in the example I posted, though it was not a very good one, I think\neveryone who took the programming 101 knows how to create a swith statement.\nComing up with something command-like would be less /easy/ but perhaps more\nsimple. This discussion would have been /simpler/ with a better and more\nrelevant example but I took the /easy/ way out and wrote the first thing\nthat came to my mind :)).\n\n/J\n\nOn 8/20/06, J. B.

Start with &quot;fewer lines of code&quot; as a measure of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; simplicity. When you get to the first counterexample, add the next\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ingredient...\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Thank you for your comment,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Are you talking about total lines of code or lines of code in one\n&gt; &gt; place?\n&gt;\n&gt; I mean lines of code (not of declarations) involved in adding the\n&gt; feature. Using this measure, the command design requires fewer lines.\n&gt;\n&gt; Another measure of simplicity is the number of algorithms that have to\n&gt; change or be created. In the case of the switch statement, we have to\n&gt; change 1 algorithm (the switch) and create 1 algorithm (the\n&gt; implementation of the new command-like thing). In the case of the\n&gt; command design, we only have to create 1 algorithm (the implementation\n&gt; of the new command) and we don&#39;t need to change any other algorithm.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Or something, I have my preference but I don&#39;t know if it is the\n&gt; &gt; simple one in everyones book. I think it can become more complicated\n&gt; &gt; than just counting lines fo code to know what is simple but I agree\n&gt; &gt; that it is a good start.\n&gt;\n&gt; When counting lines of code for this purpose, I tend only to count the\n&gt; bodies of methods and exclude lines that only declare variables.\n&gt;\n&gt; --\n&gt; J.
