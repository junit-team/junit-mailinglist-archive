Are you going to pass all these<br/>\nparameters in the constructor, store them in a separate field and then have<br/>\neach method use the particular field they need?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; The idea that I have to have tests run in a particular <br/>\n&gt; order to get repeatability strikes me as odd as well<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Why would you need to do that?  We are just talking about being able to pass<br/>\nparameters to test methods.  The order in which these methods are invoked is<br/>\nirrelevant...  right?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; Yes, with @Factory.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Thanks...<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>By the way, I believe that both TestNG (@Factory) and JUnit (suite()) made a<br/>\nmistake when implementing this concept of a factory:  it should be an<br/>\ninterface.<br/>\n<br/>\nBoth @Factory and suite() suffer from the &quot;too much magic&quot; problem:  no type<br/>\nchecking, signatures verified at runtime (and easily misspelled), etc...<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe something like:<br/>\n<br/>\npublic interface ITestFactory {<br/>\n  public Object[] suite();<br/>\n}<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Have you thought about an option like this?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; @ParameterList({ &quot;oneName&quot; }, {&quot;anotherName&quot;}, {&quot;aThirdName&quot;}) <br/>\n&gt; @Test public void testSingleString(String firstName) { ...<br/>\n&gt; }<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You mean defining the various values in the source itself?<br/>\n<br/>\nNo, I hadn&#39;t thought about it, but it&#39;s an intriguing idea.  My first<br/>\nreaction is that it would force me to recompile my source file whenever I<br/>\nwant to change or add a parameter, but I can see how a JUnit user wouldn&#39;t<br/>\nmind that :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ll forward this idea to the mailing-list, see what people think of it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; The vast majority of times I want a parameterised test, I <br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t really want a _lot_ of parameters, but I&#39;m not sure I&#39;d <br/>\n&gt; want to muck around with defining the parameters in the XML <br/>\n&gt; either;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Fair enough, I&#39;m open to hearing suggestions, but I really think that you<br/>\nneed a way to be able to invoke the same test class with different values<br/>\nfor parameters.  How would you like to do that?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I can tell you outright that the major reason I don&#39;t <br/>\n&gt; even want to think about converting a serious project to <br/>\n&gt; TestNG is that the XML file is a turn off.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>The XML file is optional and mainly here to make it easy to drive TestNG<br/>\nwith tools (the Eclipse and IDEA plug-in use it a lot) or to provide<br/>\nrepeatability (testng-failed.xml, or just email a certain test suite to a<br/>\ncoworker).<br/>\n<br/>\nMost users simply invoke TestNG from ant or from the command line and they<br/>\nnever write a single line of XML.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nCedric</div>",
