We are considering making it an\n&gt; &#39;organizationally approved&#39; tool for our development environment.\n&gt;  In order to accomplish this, we will perform a technical\n&gt; evaluation of the tool and submit an &#39;to be approved&#39;\n&gt; recommendation to our Standards Committee. A &#39;Support Plan&#39; must\n&gt; accompany the request for approval.  Consequently, I am\n&gt; researching support that is available for the tool.\n&gt;\n&gt; Do you have any specific information regarding JUnit support?\n&gt; Have any articles been written on the subject? Has a &quot;Support\n&gt; Plan&quot; been written by one of Junit&#39;s users.\n&gt;\n&gt; I have visited the SourceForge site as well as JUnit.org, so I am\n&gt; generally familiar with what is there.\n&gt;\n&gt; Does anyone provide telephone support?\n&gt;\n&gt; Thank you for any information you can provide.\n&gt;\n&gt; Penny Heatherington\n&gt; Project Lead\n&gt; OppenheimerFunds\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; This electronic mail transmission may contain confidential\n&gt; information and is intended only for the person(s) named.
