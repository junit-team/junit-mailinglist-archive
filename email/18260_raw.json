I said that\n/TDD/ /guides/ my design. TDD != tests and guide != drive.\n\n&gt;  I would also point out that the term &quot;Test-Driven Design&quot; strongly seems to\n&gt;  imply that your tests drive your design.  Which is what I was objecting\n&gt;  against.\n\nDid I write test driven design? I dont think so. But then again I do\nthink that TDD is more about design than testing so maybe it /is/ a\ngood term. I&#39;ll have to think about that.\n\n&gt;, and also why I much prefer calling it &quot;Test-Driven Development&quot;\n&gt;  (and I still think that it&#39;s something you should do whenever you can but\n&gt;  you certainly don&#39;t need to do it 100% of the time to obtain well-tested\n&gt;  code).\n\nWhenever I can is certainly most if not all of the time. Sometimes I\ndon&#39;t know how to do it and then I do something else or try harder\nuntil I do. I guess sometimes it is slower and sometimes it is faster,\nI&#39;m just not a very good judge of when it is faster or not and I get\nsurprised sometimes that things that seem easy are not and the other\nway around. But the goal is not only to have well tested code is it?\n\n",
