What i need is to write a testcase to\n&gt; &gt;check for a null condition.ie if a null value is\n&gt; &gt;inserted into the database, it should &quot;spit&quot; out that\n&gt; &gt;error!!\n&gt; \n&gt; I think you are testing the wrong thing. Do not test the JDBC driver\n&gt; implementation for the database product you&#39;re using.\n&gt; \n&gt; An exercise: write in words the situation you&#39;re trying to avoid by \nadding\n&gt; error handling. Write in business terms, and not in programming \nterms.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; J. B.
