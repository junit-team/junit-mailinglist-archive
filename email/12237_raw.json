I have a TestSuite that takes the name of a script as a\nparameter. That script contains a series of request/response pairs. I\ndynamically generate a test case for each line in the file and add it\nto the TestSuite. The name of the TestSuite is the name of the script\nfile so I can distinguish between runs.\n\nI run this insisde Eclipse and the TestSuite&#39;s name is correct (i.e.\nit&#39;s the name of the script) but when I run it using ant with an XML\nformatter, the name of the test is the name of the class. \n\nFor the time being I&#39;m going to create a second TestSuite under the\nmain test suite and give it the correct name since all the children of\nthe original have synthetic names and show up find in the generated XML.\n\nIs this a known issue? Better workarounds than what i&#39;ve mentioned above?\n\n[ BTW... feel free to comment on the way I&#39;m doing this. We want to\nsupport various scripts for different levels of the system and this\nwill make it easy for QA folks to add additional tests to the\nregression suites ]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
