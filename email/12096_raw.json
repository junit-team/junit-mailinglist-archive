(we had to - it&#39;s a really needed tool)\n\nAnd I&#39;m not satisfied with the result and the TDD-ing we did ... But before\nI share my questions and concerns, I&#39;d like to see how TDDing our assignment\nwould or should really work. For this, \n\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I invite you to also implement the tool we had to write. &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;\n\nFor this, I have put a sort of spec on my website at\nhttp://www.haraldmmueller.de/swe_tdd1.html. \n\nIt took us 2 hours 16 minutes end-to-end (including the shaky acceptance\ntest on the website), and we were as unknowing about doclets as one can be -\nso you have every chance to do the same thing in an hour or so.\n\nEveryone sending me (or posting) a &quot;TDD solution&quot; (including unit tests)\nwill get in return our code ... if you like to criticize others&#39; code, that\nshould really be an incentive ;-)\n\nWhen I have two working solutions, I&#39;ll post - if I may - our code (maybe on\nthe refactoring mailing list? don&#39;t know where it suites better) so that you\ncan tear it apart.\n\nIs this a deal ;-) ?\n\n\nJB (Joe - now I know it!) Rainsberger found time to answer - I&#39;ll only\ncomment on one part:\n\n&gt;Now fortunately, RootDoc is an interface, so we ought to be able to mock \n&gt;it, or provide a simple implementation of it, to pass in to the method \n&gt;start(), which I /assume/ you&#39;re trying to test-drive.\n\n&quot;Yes, but ...&quot; (my children&#39;s answer to almost everything ...): If you look\nat the documentation of RootDoc and related interfaces - i.e., the javadoc\nAPI -, it&#39;s not too small. Should I really mock this? I cannot see that I&#39;ll\nthen create a software that will run with the real javadoc API - I will\nmisinterpret the Javadoc and implement mocks that do what I think they\nshould do, not what the real thing does.\nSo, I need learning tests for RootDoc etc. anyway, so why not write the\ndoclet so that *is* the learning test object?\nBut when I find time, I&#39;ll try also the mock approach - otherwise, I&#39;ll\nnever lose my prejudice about it; and post the result without any feeling of\nguilt.\n\nOk - now I&#39;m waiting for contributions ...\n\nRegards\nHarald M.
