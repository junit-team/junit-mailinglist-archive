They told me to explore the<br/>\n&gt; possibility of using JUnit to unit test EJB.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>[...]<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Can any of you guys give a pointer on where is the best place to<br/>\n&gt; start looking for simple sample codes to run and play with ? I look<br/>\n&gt; into jakarta.cactus website, but they don;t offer step by step<br/>\n&gt; instructions on how to begin testing ejb. I don&#39;t even know how to<br/>\n&gt; pack EAR, WAR, or jar file.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I would direct you back to the Cactus Web site, viz:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://jakarta.apache.org/cactus/writing/howto_ejb.html\">http://jakarta.apache.org/cactus/writing/howto_ejb.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\nAnd read it more carefully, because the step by step instructions are there<br/>\nin a link.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you don&#39;t know how to pack a jar file, what are you doing in this<br/>\ngraduate course testing EJBs?  Amazing!  I would run down to the bookstore<br/>\nand pick up a good book on J2EE development if I were you.  Just look for<br/>\none that explains how to use the jar command to create EJB jar files.  I<br/>\nknow there are similarly good free tutorials on the Internet.  I would<br/>\nrecommend the Sun J2EE tutorials, but they tend to show how to do assembly<br/>\nand deployment with their GUI tools, which won&#39;t teach you portable skills.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you were on a job, I would say they gave the research project to the<br/>\n*wrong guy*.  How&#39;re you supposed to give a sound judgment as to whether<br/>\nJUnit is suitable for unit testing EJBs if you don&#39;t even know how to &quot;pack&quot;<br/>\na jar file?  Sorry, just trying to understand your position better and what<br/>\nthe motivations and pedagogical strategy of the teacher are.<br/>\n<br/>\nScott S.</div>",
