If\n&gt;there is a design flaw, we can change it but that is not the case\n&gt;here.  Becoz jUnit does not support inheritance for testing the app\n&gt;which has deep heierarchy one wouldn&#39;t want to change the design.  But\n&gt;the points that came out of this discussion were good. I would\n&gt;summarize it soon so that it would be beneficial for others..\n&gt;\n&gt;~JAK\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nSorry, I should have explained a bit more...\n\nBy &#39;legacy&#39; we simply mean code that is not covered by unit tests, not \ncode that is old.\n\nI&#39;ve been reading this thread, but what do you mean when you say  \n&#39;support inheritance for testing the app which has deep hierarchy&#39;?\n\nif we have the following:\n\nclass Base {}\nclass Intermediate extends Base{}\n\nclass FirstMostDerived extends Intermediate {}\nclass SecondMostDerived extends Intermediate {}\n\nThen there is a large inheritance tree here.  Yet even so, JUnit can \neasily test this.\n\nGood testing practices suggest that we don&#39;t test abstract classes, \ninstead we focus our testing efforts upon the most derived classes - as \nthese are the ones who are going to be used and could well override \nfunctionality defined in base classes.  Therefore we might just have two \ntestcase classes:\n\nclass FirstMostDerivedTests extends Testcase {}\nclass SecondMostDerivedTests extends Testcase {}\n\nHowever, if during development of these tests, we find duplication, it \nmight be worthwhile in creating an abstract base class for the tests, so \nthat help methods could be defined and used by both. Likewise, it might \nbe appropriate for the abstract testclass to contain &#39;some&#39; unittests \nwhich are applicable to both classes under test. \n\ne.g. the tests above become:\n\nclass AbstractTests extends Testcase{}\n\nclass FirstMostDerivedTests extends AbstractTests {}\nclass SecondMostDerivedTests extends AbstractTests {}\n\nWe might however decide that instead of using inheritance, regardless of \nthe fact that the class under test use inheritance, that we use \nassociation instead.\n\nAndrew\n\n\n\n\n",
