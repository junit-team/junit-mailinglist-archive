Is there any similar solution for that in JUnit 4?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>A different set of design tradeoffs makes this difficult in JUnit 4.<br/>\nin JUnit 3, you could ask each test case for its name, but that<br/>\nrequired having all of the test case obects instantiated, which could<br/>\nconsume a lot of memory and start-up resources.  In JUnit 4, the test<br/>\nobject does not exist until right before it runs, so it&#39;s up to a<br/>\nRunner to statically determine the name of each test.<br/>\n<br/>\nBy the way, this is also the reason for the default naming in the<br/>\nParameterized runner.  We wanted to be able to run on parameters that<br/>\nwere expensive to instantiate, or could only be traversed once,<br/>\nwithout reverting to the &quot;all work up front&quot; model of JUnit 3.  So we<br/>\nonly check the size of the parameter list when the methods are named.<br/>\nIt turns out that a lot of people are using lightweight parameters<br/>\nlike static String literals as their parameters, and, like you, have<br/>\nno problem traversing the list multiple times.  This accounts for<br/>\npretty much all the requests for renaming tests that I&#39;m aware of.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; However, I would be interested in a solution that captures<br/>\n&gt; the &quot;System.out&quot; of my &quot;testMethod[1]&quot; separately from<br/>\n&gt; the &quot;System.out&quot; of my &quot;testMethod[2]&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>There is no built-in solution for this.  When possible, I try to<br/>\ninclude as much information as possible in my assertion failures, so<br/>\nthat I don&#39;t have to look at System.out to debug.  When this isn&#39;t<br/>\npossible, would it be enough to let each test know it&#39;s own name, so<br/>\nyou could print it to System.out?  If so, check out this posting:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/junit/message/18728\">http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/junit/message/18728</a><br/>\n<br/>\nThere should probably be a better way to do this in the future, but<br/>\nI&#39;m not aware of a current feature request for it.  Thanks,<br/>\n<br/>\n   David Saff</div>",
