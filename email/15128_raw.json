Imagine you have a statefull facade under\n&gt; te=\r\nst with has 5 methods: first one take no params, second - one param,\n&gt; thir=\r\nd - two params, etc.\n&gt; \n&gt;    Should we follow your rules and break this fac=\r\nade into 5 classes?\n&gt; Should we then write separate unit test class for eac=\r\nh of those new\n&gt; classes? \n\nI&#39;d think that wether the Facade should be brok=\r\nen down is an orthogonal\nissue to wether the test class should be broken do=\r\nwn into several classes.\n\n\n&gt;    The way I see it: there should be single te=\r\nst class with several\n&gt; parameterized test cases (so several parm generator=\r\ns) and test case\n&gt; would test a single test.\n\nIt seems to me that everyone =\r\nunderstands that this is your position.\n\n&gt;    I don&#39;t quite agree with this=\r\n. Tests should be simple enough to\n&gt; require no refactorings at all. Applyi=\r\nng OOP patters to the tests may\n&gt; lead to fragile test code that will requi=\r\nre too much maintenance,\n&gt; especially if code under test is being structura=\r\nlly changed.\n\nIs that your experience? Mine is quite the opposite: as with =\r\nproduction\ncode, it is merciless refactoring that simplifies the test code =\r\nto the point\nthat it becomes less fragile and reduces the amount of mainten=\r\nance they\nneed.\n\n\n&gt;    Can you then run ALL tests you found in a search vie=\r\nw?\n&gt;    Can these results guarantee that changed method under test didn&#39;t\n&gt;=\r\n affected other methods and you don&#39;t have to run all tests for them\n&gt; too?=\r\n \n\nI don&#39;t think *any* approach can *guarantee* this.\n\nThe strategy I use i=\r\ns to seperate projects into modules which are highly\ncohesive and typically=\r\n small enough that running all of a single modules\ntests isn&#39;t much of an i=\r\nssue.\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; To say that JUnit supports or doesn&#39;t support this way of\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; =\r\norganizing tests sounds odd to me. I don&#39;t organize my tests a\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; certain=\r\n way; I refactor the tests, and that&#39;s where they tend to\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; end up.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; =\r\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt;   By the way, I believe that such freely-organized test cases will\n&gt;&gt;&gt;=\r\n be affected a lot when doing massive code refactorings and/or moving\n&gt;&gt;&gt; t=\r\nhings around classses. So, I&#39;d say it is always a tread off and has\n&gt;&gt;&gt; to =\r\nbe considered in a case by case base.\n\nWhy would that be the case???\n\n\n&gt;&gt; Y=\r\nou /believe/ this? or it&#39;s your experience? In my /experience/ it\n&gt;&gt; just i=\r\nsn&#39;t that much of an issue.\n&gt; \n&gt;    It could be not an issue for unit testi=\r\nng of the isolated classes,\n&gt; but it is quite different if those classes ha=\r\nve more or less complex\n&gt; dependencies (e.g. those that may be injected by =\r\nIoC container in real\n&gt; app, but mocked or stubbed in a test time). That pe=\r\nrhaps problem with\n&gt; the toolset because such testing usually introduces lo=\r\nt of dynamic\n&gt; dependencies only resolved or even generated in the runtime.=\r\n\n\nI don&#39;t understand how this is affected by having one or more test case\nc=\r\nlasses per production class.\n\nConfused, Ilja\n\n\n",
