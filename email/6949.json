    "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1638173518\">The problem with the name is that the CLASS TestCase is a test fixture,<br/>\nbut an INSTANCE of class TestCase, especially when running, is a test<br/>\ncase.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat always bothered me. I&#39;m not sure how to fix it. I just got used to<br/>\nit.<br/>\n<br/>\nI didn&#39;t know that test case objects were being pooled. That&#39;s<br/>\ninteresting. What were you doing in a test case object that caused<br/>\nproblems with pooling? Maybe we can learn something about your design.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can see, though, why there is a setUp() method rather than doing<br/>\nthat initialization in a constructor. In fact, I think the docs say<br/>\nthat explicitly somewhere, and if they don&#39;t, then they certainly<br/>\nshould.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo said  Eric Armstrong  on  2/12/2003 --------------------<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Somehow, I was under the impression that each test<br/>\n&gt;in a test case started with a &quot;clean slate&quot; -- that the<br/>\n&gt;setup code was re-run for each test method.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;But that doesn&#39;t appear to be the case. The test object<br/>\n&gt;created during setup turned out to be reused for<br/>\n&gt;subsequent tests in the test case, which caused problems<br/>\n&gt;arising from old state, until I figured it out.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Now, for performance, it only makes sense that a fixture<br/>\n&gt;would be reused for each test in a test case class. So I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt;not suggesting that the implementation is wrong.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;But I read the docs at the main site, and I&#39;ve been following<br/>\n&gt;these threads for quite a while, and still I had a dead-wrong<br/>\n&gt;impression of what&#39;s going on.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;For example, in the FAQ, q2 &quot;How do I use a text fixture?&quot;<br/>\n&gt;says:<br/>\n&gt;   &quot;Each test runs in its own test fixture to isolate tests from the<br/>\n&gt;   changes made by other tests. Because the tests are isolated,<br/>\n&gt;   they can be run in any order.... The JUnit framework<br/>\n&gt;   automatically invokes the setUp() method before each test is<br/>\n&gt;   run and the tearDown() method after each test is run.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Now for &quot;test&quot;, I was reading &quot;test *method*&quot;. As in testX(),<br/>\n&gt;testY(). But my recent epiphany suggests that I should have<br/>\n&gt;been reading it as &quot;test *case*&quot;, as in &quot;test-case class&quot;. And<br/>\n&gt;since the example shows a single test case class, with multiple<br/>\n&gt;test methods in it, it was easy to make that assumption.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Note:<br/>\n&gt;In general, I&#39;m not much fond of the name, &quot;TestCase&quot;, because<br/>\n&gt;to me that represents a single test. Since a TestCase class can<br/>\n&gt;actually have multiple test methods, the name &quot;TestFixture&quot; is<br/>\n&gt;probably more appropriate. But be that as it may...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;It appears to me that the word &quot;test&quot; is badly overloaded in the<br/>\n&gt;docs, meaning at various times, test method, test case, and<br/>\n&gt;potentially even test suite.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;The best way to eliminate confusion that I can see is to do a<br/>\n&gt;global search on &quot;test &quot;, and replace with one of the hyphenated<br/>\n&gt;words &quot;test-method&quot;, &quot;test-case&quot;, or &quot;test-suite&quot;, as appropriate.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>J.
