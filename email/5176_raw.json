Should it?\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; The only problem is that a single form could have its behavior driven \n&gt;&gt; by\n&gt;&gt; some data lying inside the depth of the application itself.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Yes, in nearly every application, when something happens deep within the\n&gt; application, the gui is used to communicate with the user.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; The main fact stil remains: do you all have successfully used JUnit in \n&gt;&gt; order\n&gt;&gt; to make GUI testing?\n&gt;\n&gt; We come full circle to the first question I asked this morning - what \n&gt; do you\n&gt; want to test? GUI is too big - what specifically about the GUI do you \n&gt; want\n&gt; to test? You CAN test everything except aesthetics. I try very hard to \n&gt; move\n&gt; any logic out of the gui (and you really do have to work at it) and\n&gt; someplace where I can test it, and rely on visual inspection to test the\n&gt; gui.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; --\n&gt; Robert Koss, Ph.D.     | Training, Mentoring, Contract Development\n&gt; Senior Consultant      | Object Oriented Design, C++, Java\n&gt; www.objectmentor.com   | Extreme Programming\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
