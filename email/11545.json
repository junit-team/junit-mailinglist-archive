Rainsberger&quot; &lt;jbrains@r...&gt;<br/>\nwrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; cypherfox wrote:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; How the heck do people mock things like database<br/>\n&gt; &gt; access classes, mail servers, arbitrary web requests,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; etc., without writing a huge amount of logic?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Surprisingly easily. You might just need some good examples. See<br/>\n </span></blockquote>_JUnit <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Recipes_, part 2, for details.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Heh...  Plug, plug, plug.  No argument, I&#39;ll probably read it, I&#39;m<br/>\nenough of a JUnit fan for that.  I&#39;ve read several other books and<br/>\nnone seems to clearly define how a mock object is supposed to<br/>\nbehave, or how complex you&#39;re supposed to make them.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; What am I missing?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; It&#39;s tough to say. Without looking at a specific example, I can&#39;t<br/>\n </span></blockquote>say <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; much more. Can you get concrete about a mock you wrote that<br/>\n </span></blockquote>exploded out <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; of control? Can we see code?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Sure, the most recent example of this to me, was this class:<br/>\n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.vixen.com/code/JournalHash.java\">http://www.vixen.com/code/JournalHash.java</a><br/>\nimplementing<br/>\n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.vixen.com/code/JournalDataStore.java\">http://www.vixen.com/code/JournalDataStore.java</a><br/>\n<br/>\n(All the JavaDoc is in the interface, which is why I put that<br/>\nthere also, mildly sanitized so my company name isn&#39;t<br/>\nout there.)<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the things that isn&#39;t even in there, is the concept of<br/>\n&#39;get most recent &#39;n&#39; entries&#39;, because that would require me<br/>\nto walk backwards through the TreeMap, or add a *third*<br/>\nrepresentation of the same data, as a linked list or something.<br/>\n<br/>\nI found it frustrating to have to do this much work for what<br/>\nwas really just a testing class.  It DID let me put off doing<br/>\nthe JDBC code until later, however.  Thankfully it was a<br/>\n&#39;generic&#39; enough interface that the code didn&#39;t change<br/>\nnoticably when doing the actual DB storage code.<br/>\n<br/>\n--  Morgan Schweers</div>",
