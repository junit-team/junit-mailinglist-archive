While this might seem free, it isn&#39;t.\nThere is a direct cost in terms of program size and execution speed.\n\nThe August 2003 issue of the Communications of the ACM focuses on program\ncompaction and has a lead article &quot;Extracting Library-based Java\nApplications&quot;.  This concerns software developed by IBM researchers to\nreduce the size of Java code.  One of their tools minimizes the length of\nnames where possible (it&#39;s not possible where a name is part of a\npublished interface).  Using this and other techniques they typically\nshrink Java code by well over 50% for a small one-time cost in terms of\ncomputer cycles (it takes about 4 minutes to process 3.8 MB of code on an\n800 MHz PC).\n\nThere is a reasonably reliable relationship between code size and\nspeed.  Less than half as many bytes typically means software that\nruns more than twice as fast.\n\n&gt; There seems to be some disagreement, far less specific, around how\n&gt; many that might be.\n&gt;\n&gt; I suspect that there&#39;s some sharing and learning that might help\n&gt; someone learn something. One way to do that would be to present a\n&gt; little code that one thinks is down to minimum comments, and see what\n&gt; others can do with it to make it need fewer.\n\nSure, but bear in mind the cost of using long names and an expanded\nclass hierarchy to replace comments.\n\nI&#39;m not saying it should be forbidden.  I do it myself all the time.\nBut nothing is black and white; there are always tradeoffs.\n\nHowever, if you are suggesting that documentation should always and in all\nways be minimal, I have to disagree outright.  Someone using software\nshould not have to refer to the code to understand how it works.  On the\ncontrary: there are strong arguments for never looking beyond the\nJavadocs.  If that sort of documentation is missing or is unreliable, the\ncost of using software soars.\n\nIs this relevant to testing?  Yes it is.  Where code is underdocumented,\nthe poor guy who inherits it often must resort to exploratory testing,\nto understand what the code actually does.  This is extremely expensive,\na waste of programmer time.\n\n--\nJim Dixon  jdd@...   tel +44 117 982 0786  mobile +44 797 373 7881\n\n\n",
