The assertions\n &gt; &gt; that break tell you what the behavioral change was.  If nothing\n &gt; &gt; breaks, perhaps that says the test coverage is not sufficient,\n &gt; &gt; or the rule change had no practical effect.Paul:\n &gt;\n &gt; Thank you for your comprehensive answer. Let&#39;s presume I&#39;ve reached\n &gt; the stage where I have successfully implemented the rules engine along\n &gt; with a full suite of unit tests. Would I be violating any canons by\n &gt; having JUnit output its results in some text-like form to enable quick\n &gt; comparisons between result sets of different rules changes ? Is there\n &gt; a more elegant way to accomplish this ? I&#39;m essentially trying to come\n &gt; up with a quick way to tell the user &quot;When you change Rule # 5 that\n &gt; way, loans 1, 4 and 7 fail but 2,3 and 89 now pass.&quot;.\n\nWhenever you run your unit tests, the test results are reported\nback.  Different runners report back the results in different\nways, from the GUI with the green bar [1], to XML results\ngenerated by an Ant task [2].  So, yes, you have a number of\noptions for capturing the test results to report them back.\nDepending on the format, you could use some sort of diff/compare\ntool to point out differences between two results sets if you\nneed that, but within each run it would be obvious what works\nand what breaks.\n\nWhen you say &quot;tell the user,&quot; who is the consumer of these test\nresults?  I ask because, for the most part, JUnit results are a\nbit programmer-oriented.  You can of course take something like\nXML results and format them nicer for non-programmer consumption,\nor even write your own listener to output results as needed.\nBut the results generally report back assertions that fail and\nstack traces and things like that.\n\nIf you are looking for some tests that someone like a Product\nManager might be able to work with, you might want to look into\nsomething like the Fit [3] or Fitnesse [4] frameworks that allows\nthem to specify tests in a table-like format either in a Word/HTML\ndoc or on a wiki page.  These are higher-level functional tests,\nbut your last line sounds to me a lot like a functional test, with\nthe &quot;user&quot; experimenting with the rules to see what loan types\nbreak.\n\n[1] http://junit.sourceforge.net/doc/cookbook/cookbook.htm\n[2] http://ant.apache.org/manual/OptionalTasks/junitreport.html\n[3] http://fit.c2.com/\n[4] http://www.fitnesse.org/\n\nHope that helps,\nPaul\n-----\nPaul Hodgetts -- CEO, Principal Consultant\nAgile Logic  -- www.agilelogic.com\nConsulting, Coaching, Training -- On-Site & Out-Sourced Development\nAgile Processes/Lean/XP/Scrum -- Java/J2EE, C++, OOA/D, UI/IA, XML\n\n\n\n",
