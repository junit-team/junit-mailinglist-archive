A JUnit design rule is that all the tests have to be named\n&gt; &gt; before any of them is run, and naming should not be an expensive\n&gt; &gt; activity.\n&gt;\n&gt; Hm, good point. My use in this particular case was a search in which\n&gt; any of 6 optional parameters may be sent in, so I thought to use\n&gt; parameterized to test the various combinations of empty and non-empty\n&gt; search parameters (i.e. &quot;sent name only&quot;, &quot;sent city and state only&quot;\n&gt; etc.).\n&gt;\n&gt; I even made factories to represent the expected values from the\n&gt; database and set that as the last (&quot;expected&quot;) value for each parameter.\n&gt;\n&gt; So it was a small set computationally but large enough that I thought\n&gt; it would increase readability and usability using parameterized.\n&gt;\n&gt; Perhaps there was a better way to do it.\n&gt;\n&gt; Gabriel.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
