As you have mentioned in<br/>\n&gt; your reply, we need to write a getCount() mthod to get<br/>\n&gt; the value of the &quot;counter&quot;. We do not want to do this.<br/>\n&gt; Without &quot;GET&quot; method, is there any way we can get the<br/>\n&gt; value of the &quot;counter&quot;.<br/>\n&gt; Thanks<br/>\n&gt; Balakrishnan<br/>\n&gt; ================<br/>\n&gt; public void testIncrementBy() {<br/>\n&gt; &gt;         Counter counter = new Counter();<br/>\n&gt; &gt;         assertEquals(&quot;initial value&quot;, 0,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; counter.getCount());<br/>\n&gt; &gt;         <br/>\n&gt; &gt;         counter.incrementBy(5);<br/>\n&gt; &gt;         assertEquals(&quot;incremented value&quot;, 5,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; counter.getCount());<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t see exactly why you would want this.  Perhaps it&#39;s legacy code<br/>\nwhich you can&#39;t change?  In that case there are ways to get at private<br/>\ninternals.  If that&#39;s the case, search this group&#39;s archives for &quot;testing<br/>\nprivate&quot; and you should find your answer there.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, if you are designing the system from scratch you should have the<br/>\nflexibility to make it modular enough that you don&#39;t have to test without<br/>\nsome sort of getter method.  If your coding standard is simply to not<br/>\npollute the system with getters/setters then there MUST be some object<br/>\nsomewhere that will respond to the change resulting from the call to the<br/>\nvoid method.  There must be a way to test it in that case.  I would argue<br/>\nthough that the getter is probably not that bad of an idea -- it<br/>\nrepresents access to a data object, an object that holds some data<br/>\nrepresentative of a particular state -- therefore, you must have a way to<br/>\nget at that state/data.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope that helps,<br/>\n=jason<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\n<br/>\n=jason<br/>\n[:question | ^One]</div>",
