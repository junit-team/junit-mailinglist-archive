Of course, I<br/>\n&gt; believe it can do a lot - but I am hardly an impartial party :-).<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Hi Alberto<br/>\n<br/>\nKeeping your impartial hat on ;-)  ... if we removed the context of TDD<br/>\nwould that change you view on the use of Agitator with JUnit?<br/>\n<br/>\nWe are currently looking at defining Developer Testing within our<br/>\norganisation.  I get the impression that current thinking is that I could<br/>\nuse Agitator instead of JUnit.  Now this may be correct  But I am wondering<br/>\nhow correct?<br/>\n<br/>\nIt could be correct in the same way that I could rub two sticks together<br/>\ninstead of using matches or it could be correct in that I could use matches<br/>\ninstead of a lighter.<br/>\n<br/>\nOr do you see Agitator complementing JUnit in the same way whether you are<br/>\nusing TTD or not?<br/>\n<br/>\nMy current thinking is the two tools solve slightly different problems ...<br/>\nor they address testing is different ways.  An example that comes to mind is<br/>\nin the Agitator tutorial.  In reaching full agitation the observation that<br/>\nthe length of product name is less than 20 revealed a bug.  But as I saw<br/>\nthat I thought ... but if I had a JUnit test testing the boundaries of name<br/>\nas specified would have been tested and that mistake highlighted<br/>\nimmediately.  Anyhow at the moment I am thinking that developers should<br/>\nstart with JUnit or JUnit + Agitator and not simply just Agitator.<br/>\n<br/>\nYour thoughts?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks<br/>\nShane<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",
