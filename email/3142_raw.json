TestRunner class has all the \nbasic methods which give the output the way it appears in the default \nform. I use this option because we have very comprehensive \nrequirements from different groups using JUnit and I have found this \nto be the best way to deal with the problem.\n\nSome people recommend use of &#39;ant&#39; and some scripting efforts to \nachieve the results the way you want it. I have not used that before. \nYou can look up the archive and get tons of messages and solutions \nwith respect to this query.\n\n- Nils\n\n--- In junit@y..., infosuresh@s... wrote:\n&gt; HAI ,\n&gt;           I first thank u for responding to my query.\n&gt; The thing I want to accomplish is run my test code and store the \nresults. The storage of results must be part of junit code that \nshould contain number of tests run,their names, success and failures. \nTo put in a nutshell, I need to store the output of the junit code \nthat we obtain after running it.\n&gt; \n&gt;               This is my requirement.i think this must make the \nsituation pretty clear. \n&gt; Thank You & Regards\n&gt; Suresh.S\n&gt; \n&gt; -------------------------------------------------\n&gt; This mail sent through : http://mail.sify.com\n&gt; What can Citibank help you with today?\n&gt; Click here http://promos.sify.com/citibank/\n\n\n",
