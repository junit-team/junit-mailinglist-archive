Why would Extract Class \n&gt; not be a valid refactoring? At some point a private method on a class wants \n&gt; to be a class in it&#39;s own. Am I missing something?\n\nIf extracting a class causes a method to become public that otherwise \nwouldn&#39;t be public, then it&#39;s a problem. Public APIs are rigid and \ninflexible. Public APIs can&#39;t be easily changed. Private and package \nprotected APIs can be. The less you have that&#39;s public the more flexible \nyour design is.\n\nNow if you genuinely discover that a private method would be more \nbroadly useful, and therefore should be public, fine. However if all \nyou&#39;re doing is splitting up one large unwieldy class into two or more \nsmaller classes, then the total number of public methods should not \nchange. Most methods that were private in the old class should stay \nprivate when moved to the new class. perhaps a few will become \npackage-protected instead. But they certainly shouldn&#39;t change to public \njust because they&#39;re moved from class A to class B.\n\n-- \n﻿Elliotte Rusty Harold  elharo@...\nXML in a Nutshell 3rd Edition Just Published!\nhttp://www.cafeconleche.org/books/xian3/\nhttp://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0596007647/cafeaulaitA/ref=nosim\n\n",
