User friendly guidance is important in all\n&gt; cases.\n\nThis isn&#39;t really a JUnit question.  It&#39;s a useability question.  Only\nyou and your organization can determine what the best approach here is,\nhowever I will give you some PERSONAL advice.\n\nThe list of ORACLE errors that can possibly happen are extensive.  I\nonce catalogued these in code for Oracle 9i (I think that was the\nversion).  It turned out that the catalogue was not that useful because\nmost of the errors were not recoverable.  That code ended up being\nrefactored to capture the generic SQLException and turn it into a more\nuser-friendly message.  Our hint to what was really going on were the\nlogs.  So, as a matter of experience I would suggest to you that you do\nnot try to capture specifically coded errors unless there is something\nyou can do about it programmatically.  For instance, the user will most\nlikely not be interested in the fact that the database needs to be\nrestarted.  They just need to know that something went wrong, and\nperhaps who to call when it happens.\n\nJason\n\n",
