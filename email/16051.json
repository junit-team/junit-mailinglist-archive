I have seen quite a few TDD enthusiasts choose not to use<br/>\n&gt;    debuggers for dogmatic reasons (&quot;because I read it in a book&quot;) and then<br/>\n&gt;    spend hours writing tests or even println&#39;s trying to reproduce a <br/>\n&gt; mysterious<br/>\n&gt;    bug that a breakpoint would have caught in a few minutes.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>While I agree with your overall point, I&#39;m surprised by this. If a <br/>\ndebugger could have found the problem in a few minutes, then why did it <br/>\ntake hours to write the tests? If I have to write 1 test per frame of <br/>\nthe stack trace, that&#39;s maybe 15-20 tests.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, if it takes hours to write 20 tests, then they must not be very <br/>\ngood TDD practitioners; and if they&#39;re good TDD practitioners, then the <br/>\ncode is easy to test and it wouldn&#39;t take hours to write 20 of them.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy general approach is this:<br/>\n<br/>\n1. Reason about the problem. Try to write 2-3 tests.<br/>\n2. If #1 doesn&#39;t find the problem, launch the debugger and step until we <br/>\nfind the frame of the stack where the problem occurs.<br/>\n3. Find the values of the input to that method, then drop out of the <br/>\ndebugger and write the test. It fails.<br/>\n<br/>\nVoila. As you say, a /good/ marriage between debugger and tests.<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJ. B.
