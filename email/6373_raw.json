I have found that\nthis strategy, though sometimes time consuming (circa 600 seconds), is\nwell worth it.  It&#39;s much better to find out earlier that the code you\njust wrote broke the interaction of your objects than waiting for\nintegration time.  Of course, if you are integrating often, that doesn&#39;t\nreally become an issue -- but that&#39;s a topic for another mail-list. :)\n\n=jason\n\nOn Fri, 2002-12-06 at 04:22, Vladimir R. Bossicard wrote:\n\n&gt; This has to do with understanding the role of programmer tests as\n&gt; opposed to customer tests. I have some fuzzy ideas in this direction,\n&gt; but nothing to make a paper possible yet. The bottom line is\n&gt; understanding the importance of blazing fast programmer tests and of\n&gt; separating PTs from CTs.\n\nWhat I did for Xindice (XML Database) is to separate the tests (unit,\nintegration and stress).  The unit tests run all the time but the\nintegration\ntests run less often.\n\nThe problem is that Xindice provides several drivers (xml-rpc and embed)\nto\naccess the database.  To test the xml-rpc driver, you have to generate\nthe\nxindice.war file, copy it into your Tomcat&#39;s (e.g.) webapps directory\nand\nreload it.  If you do this each time you make a tiny modification it&#39;s\nquite\npainful (and not everyone has a Tomcat server running).  So it was\nnatural to\nseparate the tests according to their complexity.\n\nif you&#39;re interested, you can browse the code\n&lt;http://cvs.apache.org/viewcvs.cgi/xml-xindice/java/tests/&gt;\n\nAnother question: how would you handle a test that is supposed to pass\nbut that\ncurrently fails because of a problem you can&#39;t fix?  &quot;All the tests must\npass\nall the time&quot; is fine if you have control over the entire code, but what\nif one\nof the libraries you use has a bug?  While other are fixing the library,\nyour\ntests are still broken but it&#39;s still ok to commit new code (because no\nother\nnew test fail)...\n\nHow can you handle the situation?  Removing the failing test (altering\nits name\nfor example) is IMO not so clean if you don&#39;t have a mechanism to\nautomatically\nspot them.\n\n-Vladimir\n\n--\nVladimir R.
