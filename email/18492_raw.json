Second, as I&#39;ve \n&gt; said elsewhere, I think this is not a useful example.  I find \n&gt; that I end up with very few tests that actually want to say\n\nI actually had this for a while in my own C# framework. Even without\nthe parentheses, I didn&#39;t find the And syntax that readable. It&#39;s\nnot the sort of thing people expect in a curly-brace language.\n\n&gt; assertTrue( 2 &lt; n && n &lt; 10, &quot;n should be inside the (2, 10) \n&gt; interval&quot;);\n&gt; \n&gt; whether I&#39;m using assertThat or not.  Do you?\n\nIt&#39;s always occasional for me and, with one exception, it&#39;s easy to \nsubstitute two asserts for it anyway. The exception is when I want\nto make multiple tests over every item in a collection. In that case,\nI either use & - which I do support - or simply build up the constraint\nin lines of code. It&#39;s not as readable as separate asserts, but it allows\nme to pass over the collection only once without writing an explicit loop.\n\nSome people would probably prefer the loop - not a problem. :-)\n \n&lt;snip/&gt;\n\n&gt; 2) Just as I find that the pressure to make my classes \n&gt; testable results in designs that appeal to me, regardless of \n&gt; testability, I find that assertThat pressures me to create \n&gt; designs that have easily asserted-on values.  For example, \n&gt; where before I might have written:\n&gt; \n&gt; assertTrue(process.finished() && process.returnValue() == 0),\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m more likely to write (partially _because_ of the \n&gt; clunkiness of the constraint syntax):\n&gt; \n&gt; assertThat(process.status(), eq(Process.SUCCESSFUL_RETURN));\n&gt;\n&gt; Now, I&#39;ve found a new class, ProcessStatus, that proves \n&gt; useful in rendering progress bars and info logs.\n\nNow this gets to a quality of test framework apis that I find\nmore important than readability: we could clal it writability\nI guess, or expressibility. :-)\n\nIf it&#39;s easy to express things naturally, you will tend to\ncreate and interfaces that are natural to use. I can&#39;t prove\nthat, but having experimented with this paradigm, I know \nit has been true for me.\n\nCharlie\n\n\n\n",
