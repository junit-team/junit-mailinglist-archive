So I think they will keep the framework lightweight.\n\nOver the last past months, only few requests concerned the framework (&quot;count assert&quot; and &quot;compare arrays&quot;).  So I think that the framework is mature and that not many extensions will beadded in the future.\n\nThe count of assertions is simple and it is always possible to create a &quot;manager only&quot; version of JUnit.  As JUnit is a development tool and not a management tool I think it&#39;s wise to keep tasks separated.\n\n-Vladimir\n\n\n\n",
