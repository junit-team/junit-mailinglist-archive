JUnit is a framework in which humans <br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;write tests; it is not a tool that writes tests.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; <br/>\n&gt;&gt; <br/>\n&gt;&gt; Well said.  I&#39;ll go farther and say that even a tool that generates a<br/>\n&gt;&gt; set of JUnit (or xUnit) stubs to test all (or some selected subset) <br/>\n&gt;&gt; the methods of a given class is incompatible with the philosophy. <br/>\n&gt;&gt; JUnit is used to test behaviour.  Behaviours and methods and not 1-1<br/>\n&gt;&gt; or onto.  A single behavior may encompass functionallity from several<br/>\n&gt;&gt; methods, and a single method may embody several behaviours.  Hmm..<br/>\n&gt;&gt; there&#39;s an article in there.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; <br/>\n&gt;&gt; <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;That being said, when I&#39;m trying to add new functionality to legacy code <br/>\n&gt;that doesn&#39;t have tests, I&#39;ll gain confidence in any way possible.  If I <br/>\n&gt;can easily run a tool that generates some amount of tests, then I&#39;ll use <br/>\n&gt;those tests as another anchor point.  That is, I&#39;ll sic the tool on the <br/>\n&gt;existing code base, then continually run the tests it generates as I&#39;m <br/>\n&gt;retrofitting the code.  Better than nothin&#39;.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This is a fine point. Look at the kinds of &quot;tests&quot; that JTest can generate: simple boundary cases and unexpected exceptions. When we write code -- since we are great programmers -- we don&#39;t screw up in such elementary ways; however, legacy code could have been written by *anyone*, so we might want to check such nonsense as NullPointerExceptions and dividing by 0. Those idiots could screw up in ways we couldn&#39;t imagine.<br/>\n<br/>\nBeyond that, though, I&#39;d rather write the tests myself. My boss may not like it, but the more I learn, the better I am at fixing the system.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;When I&#39;m writing new code for a system built test first, I want to write <br/>\n&gt;all the tests by hand.  In this case, tools actually impede the way I <br/>\n&gt;learn through testing.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I feel this whether it&#39;s a new or old system.<br/>\n<br/>\nTake care.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nJ.
