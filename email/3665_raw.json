I do appreciate it.\n\nMy first assumption is that most programmers use jOptionPane frequently in\nthe GUIs they write.\n\nMy second assumption is that these programmers use Junit to test their GUIs\nincluding jOptionPane.\n\nBefore I go deeper into the details of jOptionPane, I wonder if these are\nvalid assumptions?\n\nIf they are valid assumptions, I am curious.  Why are my questions about\nthis common approach unanswered or at least\noff the beaten trail?  The response I have received leads me to believe that\nthis path is less traveled which leads me to\nbelieve that I should be using another coding technique/approach that is\nmore common.\n\nCan you help me understand this broader issue?\n\nThanks again.\n\nlee\n\n\n\n\n12/27/01 11:17:07 AM, Berin Loritsch &lt;bloritsch@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;   lchalupa wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;   &gt;  Messages\n&gt;   &gt; Messages Help\n&gt;   &gt; Reply\n&gt;   &gt; | Forward\n&gt;   &gt; | View Source\n&gt;   &gt; | Unwrap Lines\n&gt;   &gt; | Delete\n&gt;   &gt;\n&gt;   &gt;  Message 3643 of 3658  |\n&gt;   &gt; Previous\n&gt;   &gt; |\n&gt;   &gt; Next\n&gt;   &gt;  [\n&gt;   &gt; Up Thread\n&gt;   &gt; ]\n&gt;   &gt; Message Index  Msg #\n&gt;   &gt;\n&gt;   &gt;\n&gt;   &gt; From:\n&gt;   &gt; At the request of a group member....\n&gt;   &gt;\n&gt;   &gt; &quot;lchalupa&quot; &lt;lchalupa@s...&gt;\n&gt;   &gt; Date:  Wed Dec 26, 2001  1:16\n&gt;   &gt; pm\n&gt;   &gt; Subject:  Am I headed in the right direction here?\n&gt;   &gt; New to Junit.\n&gt;   &gt; Please give advice on my approach to testing a gui.\n&gt;   &gt; In the gui, my target method displays an instance of jOptionPane class\n&gt;   &gt; to confirm a selection the user has just made. In my junit test\n&gt;   &gt; method, I want to be able to select and close the button on\n&gt;   &gt; jOptionPane after it has been displayed.\n&gt;   &gt; I am not sure how to do this. I have done this on dialogs that I have\n&gt;   &gt; created myself by looking up the button and using doClick(). Seems to\n&gt;   &gt; work just fine.\n&gt;   &gt; So, do I use the same approach on jOptionPane? I assume I would look\n&gt;   &gt; up the identifier of the button in the source and refer to it in the\n&gt;   &gt; test method? Or am I missing a more direct approach to the problem?\n&gt;   &gt; In short, I am not sure how to test a jOption Pane using Junit.\n&gt;   &gt; Am I on the right track?\n&gt;   &gt; Thanks.\n&gt;   &gt; lee\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;   So what were the results of trying the help from the previous message?\n&gt;\n&gt;   --\n&gt;\n&gt;   &quot;They that give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary safety\n&gt;     deserve neither liberty nor safety.&quot;\n&gt;                    - Benjamin Franklin\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;                 Yahoo!
