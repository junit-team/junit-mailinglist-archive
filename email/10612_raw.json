For example, for &#39;A&#39; you don&#39;t \n&gt; even need to issue the query. Just write tests that verify the SQL. \n&gt; Mock objects help here.\n\nMy approach would be to encapsulate the SQL generation into a separate\nmethod that can be called by the test.  Then construct the object as\nrequired, and ask for the SQL.\n\n&gt; For &#39;B&#39; and &#39;C&#39; You might also try using a database that has a small,\n&gt; known subset of data in it so you don&#39;t need to process as much, or use\n&gt; a mock database.\n\n&#39;B&#39; could be tested by mocking the db, and verifying that it is\ngetting the correct queries.\n\n&#39;C&#39; could be done by encapsulating the mapper and passing it a\nmock/fake resultset.\n\n&gt; In #2 again, it appears that the primary concern of the tests may be\n&gt; validating the SQL that is generated and not what is returned by the\n&gt; call, but I could be wrong.\n\nI agree.  It sounds like a series of &quot;given this VO, verify the\nresulting where clause&quot;.  As above, you could put the where clasue\ngeneration in a separate method that could be called from the test.\n\nDave\n\n\n\n",
