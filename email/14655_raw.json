You do need to test these methods. You test them by\ninvoking \n&gt; the public search method. Test methods do not need to directly invoke a \n&gt; method in order to test it, provided that the methods they do invoke \n&gt; ultimately reach into the methods being tested.\n\nHowever, by breaking the method down into parts, you can:\n* reduce the permutations to test (by making some permutations trivial)\n* make your test code simpler to understand; and\n* stumble across re-useable abstractions.\n\nNot always, but in many cases, this will be the case.\n\nYou will still need that test on the public search() method, of\ncourse. But one test should suffice - you wouldn&#39;t need several, each\nwith different values (for example, to test the null conditions)\n\nRobert.\n\n\n\n",
