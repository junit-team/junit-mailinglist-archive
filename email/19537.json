Would it handle your current situation?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>As Cedric pointed out, this only works if a test is a member of only one<br/>\ngroup.  As so many others do, many of my tests are annotated to be in<br/>\nmultiple groups.  For instance, &quot;nightly&quot; and &quot;quick&quot; and &quot;bug&quot; meaning<br/>\n&quot;I want CruiseControl to run this test every night.  Also, this test is<br/>\nquick (and is therefore suitable for our continuous build).  Finally,<br/>\nthis test illustrates a bug which is not yet fixed.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; So, questions for the community:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 1) Should something like ClasspathSuite be incorporated into JUnit?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I believe so.  I certainly need functionality like that and currently<br/>\nhave to go to an extension to get it.  Assuming there are many other<br/>\npeople in the same boat, why not build it right in?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; 2) Should something like JUnitExt&#39;s categories be <br/>\n&gt; incorporated into JUnit?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yes, especially if it allows you to annotate a test case - and<br/>\npreferably even a test method - as being a member of multiple groupings.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; 3) If yes to the above, what should the API look like?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>As far as the categories go, I would like to see a simple method-level<br/>\nannotation that looks like this:<br/>\n<br/>\n@TestGroups={&quot;nightly&quot;, &quot;quick&quot;, &quot;bug&quot;}<br/>\n<br/>\nThen, there would be a constructor on some TestSuite variant that takes<br/>\nan array of strings which are names of the test groups to include in the<br/>\nsuite.  I&#39;ve written code on my own to do this, but I&#39;d of course prefer<br/>\nfor it to be built-in to JUnit so I don&#39;t have to worry about it<br/>\nbreaking when I upgrade to the latest JUnit.  I&#39;ve been on this email<br/>\nlist for 3 years now, and the fact that we discuss the need for better<br/>\ngrouping of tests so frequently and for so long says to me that it&#39;s a<br/>\nlegitimate widespread need.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nTodd.</div>",
