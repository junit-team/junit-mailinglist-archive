I have not used JTest, but I do not see it as a substitute.\n&gt;\nI have used JTest as well as a host of similar tools and I do not  \nconsider it a substitute. Using JTest is in the same category as  \nturning up the warning level on your compiler all the way. It allows  \nyou to flag &quot;unsafe&quot; constructs and finds things which are likely to be  \nerrors, but no automated tool can judge intention, so they cannot find  \nreal design errors. Unit Testing does not find these errors either per  \nse, but the *process* of Unit Testing and TDD uncovers them. Take the  \nfollowing piece of (pseudo) code:\n\n/**\n  * @post return =  x * i\n  */\npublic int f(int x, int i)\n{\n     return x * i;\n}\n\nIs this code right? Who knows? What is it *supposed* to do? No  \nautomated tool can tell you that the return value should actually  \ncontain the *sum* of x and i. The only way to figure that out is to try  \nto use the code in a unit test and realize you cannot connect the  \npieces you wish to connect or that you are getting the wrong answer.\n\nA tool can generate &quot;automated&quot; test cases for the above, and those  \ntools will generate data to test the post-condition. Of course both the  \ncode *and* the postcondition are wrong. They often will be because they  \nare cut and pasted from the code. In many cases, the postcondition  \ncannot be expressed any more succinctly than the code itself.\n\nA tool cannot automate testing because a tool does not have access to  \nthe human context in which the code makes sense (or fails to). Unit  \ntesting tends to uncover these errors in profusion. Often it is not  \neven that test cases fail but that the errors are noticed when the test  \ncases are being written and a serious mistake is uncovered. Test-First  \nDesign makes this process more efficient by preventing the faulty code  \nfrom being written in the first place.\n\nOne of the largest advantages of TDD, therefore, is the switch in  \nfocus, from inside to outside. Writing the test cases forces one to  \nlook at the code being written from the point of view of the caller and  \nnotice errors which are not apparent from the narrow context of the  \ncode itself. Automated tools do not facilitate this thought because  \ntheir stated purpose is to remove the need to think about the issues.  \nTheir only context is internal. And so, the issues are not thought  \nabout and the coding happily continues right off a cliff.\n\nAutomated tools are useful, but they do not replace discipline and  \nprocess.\n\n&gt; ----- Original Message -----\n&gt; From: &quot;javainsel&quot; &lt;javainsel@...&gt;\n&gt; To: &lt;junit@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; Sent: Thursday, April 03, 2003 9:56 AM\n&gt; Subject: [junit] About the value of JUnit\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I am not working for Parasoft and I am completely serious.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; So don&#39;t assert false about me.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; JTest sounds very good to me, and I will test whether it will help\n&gt;&gt; our team to be more productive than using JUnit instead.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; This article is very interesting:\n&gt;&gt; http://www.javaworld.com/javaworld/jw-03-2001/jw-0323-lw-jtest.html\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; No, I&#39;m not the author of that article!\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt;&gt; junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
