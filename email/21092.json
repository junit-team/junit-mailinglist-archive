Can anyone directly me to a primer that will help? <br/>\n<br/>\nI would also be interested in any servlet based runners that have been <br/>\ndeveloped (couldn&#39;t find those either). I know that Junit <br/>\nis &quot;extendable&quot;, but I don&#39;t see any clear documentation of what <br/>\nclasses to extend, and how to link them together (and I don&#39;t really <br/>\nhave time to walk through all the Junit source).<br/>\n<br/>\n** btw, No, I&#39;m not trying to test servlets - there are lots of tools <br/>\nfor that, JUnitEE is the only Servlet runner I&#39;ve ever seen and I want <br/>\nto run my test within a full J2EE container (no mocks). Unfortunately <br/>\nno-one has updated that project for 4.x.<br/>\n<br/>\nTIA</div>",
