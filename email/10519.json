This is nice, but I would like to see a couple of things.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 1. I would like a checkbox which means add all those testmethods but<br/>\n&gt; commented out initially. This would save my usual next action which is<br/>\n&gt; to go through manually commenting them out - in some classes, this is<br/>\n&gt; a lot of work.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 2. I would like to see a checkbox and textfield which would allow me<br/>\n&gt; to append a suffix to each testmethod. At my present stage of using<br/>\n&gt; JUnit, I find I start out with the test method given me by JUnit<br/>\n&gt; automagically,  then I populate the body with my test, then I<br/>\n&gt; copy/paste the testmethod, add 001 to the end of the first of them,<br/>\n&gt; 002 to the end of the second one, and go on to edit the body of the<br/>\n&gt; second of these testmethods.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; (I know I said a couple, but pretty please..?)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Two comments.<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst, you do not appear to be talking about JUnit, but rather about <br/>\nsome IDE containing features for &quot;helping&quot; you write JUnit tests. If so, <br/>\nthen that has nothing, whatever, to do with JUnit.<br/>\n<br/>\nSecond, do not number tests. Name your test methods according to the <br/>\nspecial case they test. For example: testWithdrawOverdrawn(), <br/>\ntestWithdrawInvalidAmount(), testWithdrawInvalidAccount(), and so on.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; 3. It would be great if while viewing an existing testcase file, I<br/>\n&gt; could bring up some JUnit wizard that lets me add more testmethod(s)<br/>\n&gt; from the base or, I guess, even some other, class.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Adding test methods consists of just writing methods. No wizard should <br/>\nbe required, in any IDE.<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJ. B.
