In these cases<br/>\nit seems counter productive to create unit tests for my own code when I have<br/>\nno idea whether my code will actually work when used with the 3rd party API.<br/>\nI could end up wasting a lot time writing and testing code that is designed<br/>\nincorrectly.  In these cases, it seems more sensical to me to write<br/>\nintegration tests which involve both my code and the 3rd party API.  How do<br/>\npeople more familiar with unit testing handle such situations?<br/>\n<br/>\nMike Bresnahan</div>",
