Folks have been =\r\nusing this approach for quite some \ntime.  I have used it for years, and st=\r\nill do in the cases where a mock \nlibrary is too heavy-weight.\n\n&gt;  I find, =\r\nthough, that when I try to run the sample code in listings 5\n&gt;  and 6 throu=\r\ngh JUnit, I get a null pointer exception.\n\nWhere?\n\n&gt;  So now I&#39;m wondering =\r\ntwo things:\n&gt;\n&gt;  1- Does anyone see why this code wouldn&#39;t work?\n\nNot at fi=\r\nrst glance.\n\n&gt;  2- Does this approach to Mock classes add unnecessary compl=\r\nexity?\n&gt;  Perhaps I&#39;d just be better off using a regular ol&#39; derived class\n=\r\n&gt;  instead of an anonymous inner class.=A0 The catch is that the regular\n&gt; =\r\n ol&#39; derived class would need to be passed into the class being tested\n&gt;  a=\r\ns a constructor parameter instead of being contained completely by\n&gt;  the c=\r\nlass being tested.\n\nAs I implied before, this doesn&#39;t neccessarily add comp=\r\nlexity.  In fact, I \noften use it to avoid the complexity of a mock framewo=\r\nrk.  YMMV.\n\nOne thing to watch out for is duplication.  If you find yoursel=\r\nf creating the \nsame types of support classes as nested classes over and ov=\r\ner again it&#39;s a \nsign that you need to pull that support class out into a t=\r\nop-level (as the \narticle suggests with MockTransaction).\n\n-- \nJason Rogers=\r\n\n117 N.
