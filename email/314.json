Doug Lea, author of &quot;Concurrent<br/>\nProgramming in Java&quot;, says they still give him trouble.<br/>\n<br/>\nA few simplifications that might work for you:<br/>\n<br/>\n* Do everything in one thread (the Swing approach).<br/>\n* Immutable classes are always thread safe.<br/>\n* Classes not reachable from outside the current thread are always thread safe.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor everything else, you&#39;re on your own.
