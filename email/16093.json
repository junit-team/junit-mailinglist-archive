Was looking at JCoverage, Clover, etc so this thread is<br/>\nvery well-timed!<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not hugely familiar with EMMA... Found the site easily enough...<br/>\nWondering if anyone here is using Maven2 + JUnit + EMMA and has any<br/>\nadvice to offer? Or a sample pom.xml? :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nWayne<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On 2/14/06, Bradley, Todd &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:todd.bradley@...\">todd.bradley@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m not sure how you define &quot;large scale&quot; but we are<br/>\n&gt; using JUnit with EMMA on the commercial product under<br/>\n&gt; development right now.  EMMA does everything we&#39;ve<br/>\n&gt; needed so far, and so I don&#39;t feel any design to change.<br/>\n&gt; But there are definitely other good coverage tools out<br/>\n&gt; there, too.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The cost of implementation is very low, as is the cost<br/>\n&gt; of switching.  So why not go with EMMA for now and if<br/>\n&gt; you find it doesn&#39;t do something you need, switch it<br/>\n&gt; out later?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Todd.<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>",
