I haven&#39;t had a<br/>\nchance to take a deep look at your work, but look forward to doing so.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe motive for creating a new breaking version would be several-fold:<br/>\n<br/>\n- Primarily, it&#39;s always been my opinion that a unit-testing framework<br/>\nshould &quot;fit the grain&quot; of the host language.  It is looking like the<br/>\ntransition from Java 7 to 8 will be an even bigger shift in the grain of<br/>\nJava than between 4 and 5.  There&#39;s been a lot of things we&#39;ve wanted to do<br/>\nall along with JUnit that I&#39;ve designed first in my head the way they would<br/>\nhave worked in a language with lambdas, and then redesigned to fit the<br/>\ngrain of a lambda-less language.  Assertions (and mocks) have especially<br/>\ncontorted themselves in ways that they might finally now be able to relax.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Secondarily, personally, there are some core decisions made very early in<br/>\nthe design of JUnit 4 that are beginning to show their age, and are hard to<br/>\nfigure out how to fix while leaving everything intact:<br/>\n  - The fact that a Description is both the immutable single name of a test<br/>\nnode, and a mutable builder for the test structure, and then later an<br/>\nimmutable reference for the test structure, is exasperating.<br/>\n  - The reliance on reflectively-discovered constructors for extensibility<br/>\ncauses some awkwardness.<br/>\n  - The IDE-centric idea that one should be enable to enumerate all tests<br/>\nbefore any is run places some binding constraints, and should be at most<br/>\noptional in a world in which tests are often run by daemons many more times<br/>\na day than by humans.<br/>\n  - There are as many perfect models of test status possibilities as there<br/>\nare developers.  Passed/Failed?  Passed/Failed/Skipped?<br/>\n Passed/Failed/Ignored, etc.  The current design bakes one required system<br/>\npretty deep into the internals, unnecessarily.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, should the framework to which I&#39;d contribute time to fix these<br/>\nproblems be called JUnit 5, or something entirely different?  That&#39;s<br/>\nanother kettle of fish, with some interesting options to consider.  Looks<br/>\nlike we have at least 9 months to consider them at length.<br/>\n<br/>\n   David Saff<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Wed, Dec 12, 2012 at 5:40 PM, Esko Luontola &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:esko.luontola@...\">esko.luontola@...</a>&gt;wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; **<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve written a testing framework called Specsy (<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://specsy.org/)\">http://specsy.org/)</a> that<br/>\n&gt; runs on Scala, Groovy and also Java. Though it works on Java 7, the<br/>\n&gt; syntax is awfully verbose [1], but with Java 8&#39;s lambdas it will be<br/>\n&gt; quite close to the Groovy version [2]. The motivation for creating<br/>\n&gt; Specsy was to have test isolation (like JUnit and JDave), nested tests<br/>\n&gt; (like JDave and Scala&#39;s specs), and instead of &quot;after methods&quot; it has<br/>\n&gt; more expressive defer blocks (like Golang).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; [1]<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://github.com/orfjackal/specsy/blob/master/specsy-java/src/test/java/org/specsy/java/JavaSpecsyExample.java\">https://github.com/orfjackal/specsy/blob/master/specsy-java/src/test/java/org/specsy/java/JavaSpecsyExample.java</a><br/>\n&gt; [2]<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://github.com/orfjackal/specsy/blob/master/specsy-groovy/src/test/java/org/specsy/groovy/GroovySpecsyExample.groovy\">https://github.com/orfjackal/specsy/blob/master/specsy-groovy/src/test/java/org/specsy/groovy/GroovySpecsyExample.groovy</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Right now I&#39;m implementing a new test runner called Jumi<br/>\n&gt; (<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://jumi.fi/)\">http://jumi.fi/)</a> to overcome a bunch of limitations of the JUnit test<br/>\n&gt; runner, as explained in <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ggi6yutRZ9Y\">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ggi6yutRZ9Y</a><br/>\n&gt; During this winter holiday I should be able to add support for test<br/>\n&gt; discovery, maybe also JUnit backward compatibility, after which it<br/>\n&gt; should be usable for early adopters (right now it&#39;s usable only for<br/>\n&gt; testing framework developers - Specsy 2.0 runs on Jumi).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; What does this have to do with JUnit 5?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; - Firstly, both of these frameworks I mentioned had clear goals to do<br/>\n&gt; some things that were lacking in JUnit and other frameworks. What are<br/>\n&gt; the goals for JUnit 5? What would be such a radical improvement that it<br/>\n&gt; would warrant a major release (that breaks compatibility, basically<br/>\n&gt; being a new testing framework) instead of minor 4.x releases?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; - Secondly, if you decide to create a &quot;JUnit 5&quot; that is a radical change<br/>\n&gt; from JUnit 4, instead of an incremental update, then please keep an eye<br/>\n&gt; on Jumi. If JUnit 4&#39;s test runner is not enough for JUnit 5, then it<br/>\n&gt; could run using Jumi instead of creating yet another test runner. That<br/>\n&gt; would save time from yourself and all the tool vendors who would need to<br/>\n&gt; integrate with any new test runner.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --<br/>\n&gt; Esko Luontola<br/>\n&gt; www.orfjackal.net<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed] </span></blockquote></div>",
