Even experienced users can have trouble finding a\n&gt;&gt; relatively unfamiliar class, and that&#39;s a small API as APIs go, and\n&gt;&gt; much better documented than most.\n&gt; \n&gt; I don&#39;t remember having that problem, or having it seen mentioned on the\n&gt; mailing list often.\n\nUsers rarely recognize or classify the underlying source of their \nconfusion as poor API design. However, every time someone  asks a \nmailing list, &quot;How do I do X?&quot; when the answer is sitting right inside \nthe JavaDocs somewhere is a code smell. I know JUnit fairly well, but \nI&#39;ve still asked one or two questions here that were answered in the API \ndocs if I&#39;d looked in the right package.\n\nIf the API were smaller, easier to search, and easier to comprehend, \nthen there&#39;d be fewer questions about it.  Users would be able to help \nthemselves more frequently. Size alone is a significant contributor to \ncomplexity. The more methods and classes there are to hunt through, the \nharder it is to find what you&#39;re looking for. JUnit is a relatively \nsmall and simple API. If it has these problems, imagine how much worse \nthey are for larger, more complex APIs.\n\n-- \n﻿Elliotte Rusty Harold  elharo@...\nXML in a Nutshell 3rd Edition Just Published!\nhttp://www.cafeconleche.org/books/xian3/\nhttp://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0596007647/cafeaulaitA/ref=nosim\n\n",
