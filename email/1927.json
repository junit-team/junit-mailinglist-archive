    "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1081812423\">I previously posted a problem I was having using the JUnit framework <br/>\nwith Visual J++. Mr problems specifically were that when I tried to <br/>\nrun the test code supplied with JUnit, I got IO exceptions to do with <br/>\nCreateProcess. <br/>\n<br/>\nI posted details of my problems to the MS Java-COM mailing list. Don <br/>\nMcCaughey used to have the same problems and had managed to find the <br/>\ncause and the solution. I am cross posting his message here (he has <br/>\ngiven me the ok to do this) so that any other Visual J++ users who <br/>\nrun into the same issues will be able to find the answer here, too.<br/>\n<br/>\nDon&#39;s message:<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you check the source code for the test fixture that&#39;s failing<br/>\n(junit.tests.TextRunnerTest), notice that it attempts to build the <br/>\npath to java.exe (Sun&#39;s equivalent of jview.exe) in order to run a <br/>\nclass in another process using Runtime.exec().  Microsoft&#39;s Java is <br/>\norganized differently so this fails.  It also fails under <br/>\njunit.awtui.TestRunner and junit.swingui.TestRunner won&#39;t work at all <br/>\nsince VJ++ doesn&#39;t have the Swing libraries.  All the other tests ran <br/>\nso you&#39;re in good shape.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Don<br/>\n<br/>\nSure enough, I modified the test code to use the &quot;JView&quot; command <br/>\ninstead of &quot;java&quot; and everything works perfectly.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope this helps.<br/>\n<br/>\nRegards,<br/>\n<br/>\nKrishna</div>",
