Regarding<br/>\nSBT, there is the ~test-quick action that attempts to run only the tests<br/>\nrelevant for what you have changed (my interpretation from using it, don&#39;t<br/>\nknow /exactly/ how it optimizes). It seems SBT has quite excellent<br/>\ndependency analysis that allows for these kinds of features.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, SBT&#39;s console really is such an obvious thing to do given hot spot<br/>\noptimizers etc so it&#39;s almost weird that maven, ant et al did not do this.<br/>\nWhy wouldn&#39;t one keep the build/test-tool running? (given how long it takes<br/>\nto start a JVM and how much things can accelerate once the hotspot kicks in<br/>\nand does it&#39;s magic; usually several seconds into execution if I understand<br/>\nthings correctly). I<br/>\ns this what you are after with class loader caching? to be able to keep a<br/>\nJVM-instance running over time and just swap in changed classes?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----------------------------------------------------<br/>\nJoakim Ohlrogge<br/>\nAgical AB<br/>\nV�sterl�nggatan 79, 2 tr<br/>\n111 29 Stockholm, SWEDEN<br/>\n<br/>\nMobile: +46-708-754004<br/>\nBlog: johlrogge.wordpress.com<br/>\nTwitter: @johlrogge<br/>\nE-mail: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:joakim.ohlrogge@...\">joakim.ohlrogge@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Thu, Jun 23, 2011 at 1:36 PM, Esko Luontola &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:esko.luontola@...\">esko.luontola@...</a>&gt;wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; **<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Joakim Ohlrogge wrote on 23.6.2011 11:48:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I think this is where my idea was different. I planned to delegate the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; running completely to other frameworks and just be flexible about what<br/>\n&gt; they<br/>\n&gt; &gt; can report back. So it becomes more of a presentation-issue (it seems to<br/>\n&gt; me<br/>\n&gt; &gt; that you are also focusing on running the tests, especially being clever<br/>\n&gt; &gt; about ordering the run sequence for high probability of catching failing<br/>\n&gt; &gt; tests fast).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Yes, I&#39;m focusing on running the tests. From a testing framework&#39;s point<br/>\n&gt; of view, Jumi provides a similar interface as JUnit&#39;s @RunWith<br/>\n&gt; annotation and the related APIs.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Jumi will also include things such as test discovery and starting up the<br/>\n&gt; JVM instance, which previously have been taken care of build tools and<br/>\n&gt; IDEs. There will also be a graphical UI, so that it would be usable even<br/>\n&gt; without IDE integration. My goal is to solve some cross-cutting concerns<br/>\n&gt; which affect the full tool chain of running tests. It will also try to<br/>\n&gt; minimize the small differences between running tests in a build tool vs<br/>\n&gt; IDE, and protect from the effects of bugs in IDEs&#39; support for running<br/>\n&gt; tests (I&#39;ve encountered many such issues).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; It also looks very promising with focus on performance. Have you looked<br/>\n&gt; into<br/>\n&gt; &gt; incremental running al� SBT or is that left to tools like SBT?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I know about SBT&#39;s incremental compiler. Does it also do something smart<br/>\n&gt; related running tests?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; SBT and FSC were my inspirations for class loader caching: Jumi will use<br/>\n&gt; a separate class loader for library JARs and cache it, so that when<br/>\n&gt; running tests there would not be the overhead of loading a large<br/>\n&gt; library&#39;s classes (for example on my C2Q6600 it takes over 200ms to load<br/>\n&gt; Guice the first time). With Java 6 and before, class loading is single<br/>\n&gt; threaded (Java 7 will have parallel classloading), so that has been a<br/>\n&gt; bottleneck for running tests in parallel.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; JUnit Max&#39;s way of reordering tests, so that those which fail the most<br/>\n&gt; likely are run first, is also one thing that I&#39;ll include. I have a<br/>\n&gt; habit of waiting for the tests to finish executing before typing more,<br/>\n&gt; so the UI will also give some feedback about when the<br/>\n&gt; most-likely-to-fail tests have been run, so that I could resume typing<br/>\n&gt; faster. And running tests in parallel is of course a must - finally some<br/>\n&gt; use for my 4 CPU cores. :)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The above optimizations are especially aimed for speeding up test suites<br/>\n&gt; which run in a matter of seconds. If it takes 3 seconds to run all<br/>\n&gt; tests, a speedup of 0.5 seconds is big.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ll also provide something for big companies which are full of mediocre<br/>\n&gt; developers writing slow tests. Running tests in a cluster is outside the<br/>\n&gt; scope of Jumi&#39;s core functionality, but I&#39;ll create a commercial plugin<br/>\n&gt; for that. (Who wouldn&#39;t want to get a living from writing open source?<br/>\n&gt; ;) I&#39;m not sure how much running tests in a cluster would speed up<br/>\n&gt; already fast test suites, because of network latency, but I&#39;ll try and<br/>\n&gt; see what I can do about it.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --<br/>\n&gt; Esko Luontola<br/>\n&gt; www.orfjackal.net<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed] </span></blockquote></div>",
