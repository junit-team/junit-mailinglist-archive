However, the test case needs to\nrecursively run=\r\n against, say, the names of all the files in a folder\nand its subfolders.\n\n=\r\nEach file is a different test case, but the number, type and content\nof fil=\r\nes during each run will differ.\n\nI don&#39;t want to pass all the files into my=\r\n testXXX method in one shot\nbecause that would mean the following:\n- Semant=\r\nically, it would be the equivalent of a single test case, not\nmultiple, and=\r\n\n- The test case would abort the moment it failed on a single file\ninstead =\r\nof running through all the files (like I want it to)\n\nI haven&#39;t seen this a=\r\nddressed anywhere. How do I achieve this? What is\nthe best/recommended way =\r\nto write/execute a single JUnit test case\nwith a sequence of multiple, vary=\r\ning inputs?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
