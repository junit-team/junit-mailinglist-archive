This is one \nsource of common misconceptions that tests are overhead.\n\nTo solve the problem, testFindAll() should set up the data it needs in \nthe database, so that it controls the expected outcome. This is an \nimportant trait of any good test, and not just tests that use a database.\n\n&gt; Yes I agree a DB query will increase the time taken to execute the\n&gt; tests but on the contrary by automating that step anyone can run my\n&gt; tests with minimum or no code change.\n\nI disagree. The more tests rely on external resources, the more \n/difficult/ they are to run by different people on different machines at \ndifferent times. That&#39;s been my experience.\n-- \nJ. B.
