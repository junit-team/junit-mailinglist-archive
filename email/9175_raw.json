However we are pursuing permission to\n   contribute back to the OSS Abbot project whose work we extend, so we\n   hope you will be interested in its development.\n\nSUMMARY:\n\nThe OSS Abbot project allows JUnit-based test automation for AWT/Swing\nUIs. This first release of &quot;Abbot for SWT&quot; provides a demonstration of\nthe feasibility of extending Abbot to automate SWT UIs. It is\ncurrently available only through the IBM Internal Open Source Bazaar\n(IIOSB), but should go OSS in the near future.\n\nDETAILS:\n\nDo you develop SWT UIs?\nDo you function-test your UIs?\nDo you test manually?\nIf all your answers are &quot;yes&quot;:\n\nAre you interested in automating your tests using &quot;in-source&quot; JUnit\ntestcases (i.e. without out-of-source scripting or blackbox tools)?\nIf so, read on:\n\nAbbot is an OSS project\n\nhttp://sourceforge.net/projects/abbot\n\nenabling you to\n\n* automate AWT/Swing UIs\n\n* do test-first development of AWT/Swing UIs\n\n* automate regression testing of AWT/Swing UIs using robust,\n   refactorable JUnit testcases and suites\n\nAbbot also provides a record/play capability, enabling more rapid\ndevelopment of testcases and suites for existing code, as well as\nbasic blackbox-style testing. For more detail, see this recent JDJ\narticle:\n\nhttp://www.sys-con.com/java/articleprint.cfm?id=1940\n\nas well as the documentation available from the Abbot site.\n\n&quot;Abbot for SWT&quot; (project name=abbotforswt) is an Eclipse plugin which\nseeks to extend Abbot ... for SWT (but you guessed :-) It is currently\navailable only from the IIOSB (a &quot;walled garden&quot; version of\nSourceForge inaccessible outside IBM) @\n\nhttps://w3.opensource.ibm.com/projects/abbotforswt/\n\n(IIOSB residence is intended to be temporary. We are currently in IBM\nOpen Source Steering Committee pre-review, and therefore hope to\ncontribute our extensions back to Abbot sometime this millenium :-)\nFor more detail, see the (currently rather crude) abbotforswt homepage\n\nhttp://w3.opensource.ibm.com/~abbotforswt/\n\nTo demonstrate abbotforswt&#39;s feasibility, we have taken scenario 2\nfrom the JDJ article above, recoded its SUT (a dialog) in SWT, and\ndesigned and implemented an API targeting SWT equivalent to Abbot&#39;s\nexisting API targeting AWT/Swing. For more details, see our release\nnotes @\n\nhttp://w3.opensource.ibm.com/project/shownotes.php?release_id=597\n\nSound interesting? Try it out! However, first:\n\n&lt;required legalese&gt;\n\nIf you are an IBMer and have NOT already completed your &quot;OSPG\ntraining,&quot; please read the Open Source Participation Guidelines\n\nhttp://ltc.linux.ibm.com/open_source/ospg.html\n\nbefore you check out any code.\n\n&lt;/required legalese&gt;\n\nYou have 2 installation options:\n\n0 Install the release zip. Goto our release page\n\nhttp://w3.opensource.ibm.com/project/showfiles.php?group_id=1023\n\n   read the &quot;IMPORTANT NOTICE&quot;, then follow the instructions in the\n   release notes\n\nhttp://w3.opensource.ibm.com/project/shownotes.php?release_id=597\n\n   Note that you need not register for IIOSB to get the release, but we\n   hope you will, because you&#39;re a fine human being. (Apologies for\n   speciesism to all the fine non-human programmers\n\nhttp://www.newtechusa.com/PPI/pressroom.asp#higher\n\n   out there :-)\n\n1 Install from CVS. This is a good first step toward becoming an\n   abbotforswt contributor!\n\n- Run your development workbench (devbench) with either Target\n   Platform pointing to a WSAD build (which is how I tested), or just\n   import org.apache.xerces (should work, but not tested).\n\n- Create a new CVS repository location with\n\n   host=cvs.opensource.ibm.com\n   repository path=/cvs/abbotforswt\n   user=anonymous\n   no password\n   connection type=pserver\n\n   and check out HEAD/abbotforswt.\n\n- Browse to our release notes\n\nhttp://w3.opensource.ibm.com/project/shownotes.php?release_id=597\n\n   search or scroll to &quot;run the demo&quot;\n\n- Skip to step 4\n\nThe demo can then be run in each of 3 ways, all of which are\ndocumented in the release notes:\n\n* using Test Collector in a launched WebSphere Studio build.\n\n* using pde.junit to launch an Eclipse or WS build\n\n* using Eclipse&#39;s JUnit to launch just the UI\n\nObviously this is just the beginning: abbotforswt will need a lot more\nwork to become the kind of full-featured, coder-friendly tool that\nwill help you do better FVT (and eventually PVIT and BVT) of your SWT\nUIs. But we can get there faster if you help abbotforswt help you:\nregister to become a project contributor, and help us develop,\ndocument, test, and support. Check the &quot;Project Help Wanted&quot; page\n\nhttp://w3.opensource.ibm.com/people/\n\nor just reply to this note. (Feel free to forward this note!)\n\nNote that, to check _in_ to an IIOSB project, you will need to use\nssh2 under the CVS &quot;ext&quot; protocol. You will therefore want to install\nssh-agent: see\n\nhttp://w3.opensource.ibm.com/~abbotforswt/ssh-agentHowto.txt\n\nfor one way (but a known-good way) to do this on windows.\n\nTIA, Tom Roche, IBM WebSphere Studio Model2 Tooling\n\n\n",
