Perhaps someone here can help?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; Can anybody shed light on this definition of the parallel attribute in the  plugin docs?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ......<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; parallel \t<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; String \t2.2 \t(TestNG only) When you use the parallel attribute, TestNG will try to run all your test methods in separate threads, except for methods      that depend on each other, which will be run in the same thread in order to respect their order of execution.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;  In JUnit 4.7 the values are classes/methods/both to run in separate threads, as controlled by threadCount.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; .....<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I have junit test tests and when I set parallel = methods it runs everything synchronously, however when I set parallel = classes, it runs the classes in parallel. I haven&#39;t been able to find good documentation for this anywhere.. Does anybody know of any good resources? <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Also, assuming I can get methods to work, does it run all methods in parallel or does it run the methods in parallel by class? i.e. 1 class at a time but all the methods in that class are parallel?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Are there other gotchas or configuration settings I should be considering? I.E. I&#39;ve read a little bit on ConfigurableParallelComputer but I&#39;m not sure what it&#39;s all about.. </span></blockquote></div>",
