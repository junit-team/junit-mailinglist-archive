For  \nexample:\n\nvoid testThreadDidSomething() {\n\tfinal MyThread thread = new Thread();\n\tthread.start();\n\twhile (!thread.isFinished())\n\t\t;\n\tassertThreadDidSomethingItWasSupposedTo(thread);\n}\n\n\nOn Thursday, July 10, 2003, at 04:12 PM, lukatmyshu wrote:\n\n&gt; I have an API that when I call it, puts an event on a queue\n&gt; somewhere.  Eventually the event is passed to an EventHandler\n&gt; object.  I&#39;d like to test the process of placing an event on the\n&gt; queue and it being handled so I have a test method that posts the\n&gt; event, I implement my EventHandler interface and in the method that\n&gt; the interface provides I verify the data is what I posted.  The\n&gt; problem I am getting is that even though the assertion is thrown, the\n&gt; Test failure is not included in the TestResult object.  In addition I\n&gt; pass in a PrintStream to the JUNit TestRunner but in this case, the\n&gt; error output appears on System.out not my PrintStream.  My feeling is\n&gt; that what&#39;s happening is that my test method posts the Event, then\n&gt; the flow of excution passes back to the TestRunner with no exceptions\n&gt; thrown.  Later the event is caught, and if it fails the exception is\n&gt; thrown but by this time the TestResult object has already been\n&gt; created.  Is there a prescribed way of testing such methods?\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------ Yahoo!
