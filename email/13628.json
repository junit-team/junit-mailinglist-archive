That&#39;s what class invariants are for. Each public<br/>\n&gt; &gt; method is atomic. It is invoked when an object is any legal<br/>\n&gt; &gt; state and when the method returns it is always careful to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; leave the object in one of the legal states (barring bad<br/>\n&gt; &gt; synchronization and complicated multithreaded issues).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; That&#39;s not what I was saying.  I am sure your code won&#39;t crash if the<br/>\n&gt; method is called without these prerequisites, it&#39;s just that it won&#39;t be<br/>\n&gt; doing anything useful (no-op or throwing an exception), so testing it in<br/>\n&gt; these conditions will be useless:  you need to set up these prerequisites<br/>\n&gt; before you invoke the method.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; However, a situation where public method A must be<br/>\n&gt; &gt; invoked before method B is a code smell.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I see code like this every day, and it&#39;s not a code smell to me.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; It&#39;s just what a program is about:  the logical execution of statements in<br/>\n&gt; a certain order.  Run them in a different order and the program no longer<br/>\n&gt; does what it&#39;s supposed to do.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>That&#39;s a different issue, though. That the program has different <br/>\neffects if method calls are reordered is one thing; that the program <br/>\nfails *internally* if they&#39;re reordered is another.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor example, consider a Jena RDF Model object (which can be usefully<br/>\nthough of as a set of (S P O) statements, where S P and O are Resources<br/>\nnamed by URIs [1]).  You can .add(S P O) and .remove(S&#39; P&#39; O&#39;) to<br/>\nyour heart&#39;s content, with different S&#39;s and P&#39;s and O&#39;s, and the<br/>\nModel will eat it all up; you can invoke the methods in any order<br/>\nyou like.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, for whatever effect you *want*, there&#39;s probably a best ordering,<br/>\nand lots of broken orderings. Nevertheless, each sequence of add/remove<br/>\ncalls is well-defined [2] - there&#39;s no &quot;you must do X to allow Y&quot;<br/>\ncircumstances. <br/>\n<br/>\n[1] S and O can also be &quot;blank&quot;, ie non-named, Resources, and O can<br/>\n    can be a literal value, but that doesn&#39;t affect this discussion.<br/>\n<br/>\n[2] Well, a model might be immutable, in which case the well-definition<br/>\n    is a bit boring - it throws an exception on the first mutation.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nChris &quot;electric hedgehog&quot; Dollin<br/>\n&quot;The compiler is free to insert padding because it makes the struct <br/>\nlook bigger and scares away predators.&quot; [Keith Thompson, comp.lang.c]</div>",
