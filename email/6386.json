Part of the reason<br/>\nfor this is that if one test fails, you can re-run it during your<br/>\ndebugging to see if you&#39;ve made progress fixing the problem.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf your tests aren&#39;t independent, you&#39;ll have to have some way of<br/>\ndocumenting which test&#39;s side effect allows your other test(s) to be<br/>\nrun.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs you point out, though, there&#39;s clearly a cost involved in making all<br/>\nyour tests independent, and use the &#39;setup() and teardown()&#39; methods. <br/>\nIf this cost is prohibitive, you may want to consider changing those<br/>\ntests that are currently separate, interrelated tests to be one<br/>\nindependent test.  (I&#39;d to this by renaming your current interrelated<br/>\ntest methods to be private helper methods, and have a larger &#39;test&#39;<br/>\nmethod call them in the order you want).<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is the approach I&#39;ve been taking, and its simplified things a<br/>\ngreat deal both in my own process, and when people use tests I&#39;ve<br/>\nwritten.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Kevin Klinemeier<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nNew DSL Internet Access from SBC & Yahoo!<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sbc.yahoo.com\">http://sbc.yahoo.com</a></div>",
