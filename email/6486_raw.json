B. Rainsberger [mailto:jbr@...]\n&gt; So said  Michael Silverstein  on  2002-12-17 --------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;That said, it would be nice if Smalltalk supported\n&gt; &gt;Interfaces, which I find extremely useful but is not yet \n&gt; supported in\n&gt; &gt;Smalltalk, to my knowledge.\n&gt; \n&gt; Smalltalk supports interfaces, in a way; although it supports\n&gt; abstract classes even better.\n&gt; \n&gt; Push a method up to a superclass and, in the superclass, have\n&gt; the method answer &quot;SubclassResponsibility&quot; or whatever the \n&gt; exact method name is.\n\nI really don&#39;t see how it can be said that standard Smalltalk supports\nanything like an Interface. I like Interfaces because they are the\npurest form of abstraction I&#39;ve found. Interfaces are completely\nagnostic about implementation to the point that they make no assumptions\nabout which type they are to be applied to. \n\nTo tie this into JUnit, any class can implement the Test interface and\nautomatically be considered a test. Of course JUnit stumbles insofar as\ncollecting suites (see the static suite() method and my earlier comments\nabout that), but that&#39;s mainly because of its departure from the use of\nits own Test interface to define an API for test collection.\n\nUsing &#39;^self subclassResponsibility&#39; is a sort of stopgap mechanism for\nindicating abstraction, but appears in my opinion to be weaker than\nbeing able to use an &#39;abstract&#39; modifier. Plus using abstract classes\nand methods falls short of interfaces because you are still tied to a\nparticular hierarchy. Not that this mechanism is bad but it limits your\nflexibility to a degree.\n\n&gt; I have found that I don&#39;t want interfaces when I work with Ruby or\n&gt; Smalltalk: I like the idea that handling methods has nothing\n&gt; to do with type.\n\nI don&#39;t know what this statement means. Can you elaborate?\n\nFrom the above, it may appear that I am contradicting my earlier\ncontention that Smalltalk is a better OO language, but believe me I am\nnot. Lack of support for interfaces is a nit compared to some of the\nhorrors I&#39;ve seen in the Java language. For a taste, try to exploit\nclass side (static) polymorphism.\n\n- Mike\n\nSilverMark, Inc.\nThe Object Testing Company\nwww.javatesting.com\n\n\n\n",
