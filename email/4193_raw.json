Having \n100% coverage of your code unit tested doesn&#39;t mean that your product \nhas no bug.  Try other testing approach too.\n- how confident are you that one module is working fine or not?  Start \nby testing the modules you think are the more likely to have bugs.  If \nsome kind of tests already exist for some buggy module, try to recompile \nand execute them.  If you don&#39;t have tests, it&#39;s the right time to write \nsome.  (I don&#39;t know how many tests you have already written, it&#39;s maybe \ntoo time consuming to fix them all right now, or maybe not).\n- force the tests to be compiled and executed during the normal build\n- it can frustrating for developers to face a huge buggy code so try to \nfind metrics showing that you are making progress (# open bugs, class \ntestes, % coverage).\n\n-Vladimir\n\n-- \nVladimir Bossicard\nwww.bossicard.com\n\n\n",
