The workflow would be easy: I make sure that the database layer and the layer I want to test works (it has to call the correct database-layer methods) and then I run the test in &quot;record-mode&quot;. After that I can start the tests in replay mode, I don&#39;t need to use the database object itself anymore but instead the cached results are returned, however, still with the mock-object characteristics (if the methods of the mockobject aren&#39;t called in the correct order or with wrong parameters I would get an exception).\n\n\nThis will result in very brittle tests because it will overly\nconstrain the number and order of calls and exact parameter values,\nmany of which will be irrelevant to the test.  Any change to your\nobjects will then break your tests for no real reason.\n\nIf you&#39;re worried about performance, you could use an in-memory\ndatabase (E.g. HSQLDB, http://hsqldb.org/) for testing instead of mock\nobjects.\n\nMock objects are tool for test *driven* development.  They help you\ndesign the communication protocols between your objects.  JMock has\nmany features that let you describe a protocol to be followed in a\ntest, not the exact sequence of calls that will occur.  E.g. you can\nallow or ignore some calls, expect a minimum number of calls, loosen\nconstraints on parameter values or ignore parameters altogether,\nexpect calls to occur only when the object is in a specific state, and\nso on.\n\nIn my experience, the result of using mock objects in TDD is an OO\ndesign in which objects are loosely coupled, talk in a &quot;Tell, Don&#39;t\nAsk&quot; style and the inter-object protocols are an important aspect of\nthe design.  In a system that has been written without tests and mock\nobjects (again, in my experience), classes are more tightly coupled,\nthere are many static functions and objects have many getters and\nsetters.  This style of code does not lend itself well to testing with\nmock objects.\n\n--Nat\n\n",
