That&#39;s when I found the problem, namely, if I don&#39;t put the <br/>\nsource files into the same directory as the class files, it doesn&#39;t <br/>\nwork.  I was using the GUI testrunner for this, but was never quite <br/>\nsure what I was loading, so tried the Text textrunner, and now it <br/>\nappears that I have CLASSPATH problems (the old <br/>\nNoClassDefFoundError).  Thanks!<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a>, Jason Rogers &lt;jacaetevha@f...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; JUnit does not depend on source files.  You are probably using Ant <br/>\nor<br/>\n&gt; some other tool to start up JUnit.  The problem is most likely <br/>\nthere. <br/>\n&gt; Try it straight from the command line and see if you get different<br/>\n&gt; results.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; =jason<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; On Wed, 2003-05-14 at 19:54, junitguy wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I keep my source files in a &quot;src&quot; directory.
