I think you mean that when the test method tries to use the \n&gt; logger variable, it is not yet initialized, and therefore is null.\n&gt; \n&gt; Q: How do you normally initialize the logger? Can you do that \nwithin \n&gt; your tests? (You may want to look at TestSetup to do this once for \nyour \n&gt; test suite.)\n&gt; -- \n&gt; J. B.

The logger variable was being initiallized in \nejbCreate() and hence the NullPointerException.\n\nThanks.\n\n\n\n",
