This contradicts with the idea that each test case should be<br/>\nindependent. On the other hand the test cases are easy to write and I&#39;m happy<br/>\nwith the result. I wonder if there is any convincing reason to write a complex<br/>\ntest case just so it can be totally independently from the others.<br/>\n<br/>\nWai Yip Tung<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- javainsel &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:javainsel@...\">javainsel@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; We want to test the creation, update and deletion of an object which <br/>\n&gt; is persisted in database.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; What we now do is to have three test methods for this.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; In the testCreate method the object is created, checked that he is <br/>\n&gt; really created and then it is deleted (we have delete because <br/>\n&gt; unfortunately we don&#39;t use Mock Objects).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; In the testUpdate method we create the object, update it, test the <br/>\n&gt; update result and delete the created object.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; In the testDelete method we create the object so that we can test <br/>\n&gt; the deletion of it.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; As you see, everything is included in the testUpdate method. We <br/>\n&gt; duplicate much code in the other two test methods.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; We write such tests for every domain object so I wonder if we should <br/>\n&gt; improve our test class.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Would you write 3 or just 1 test method for that example?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; And would you try to convince senior coworkers who know little about <br/>\n&gt; JUnit and dislike TDD?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\">junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
