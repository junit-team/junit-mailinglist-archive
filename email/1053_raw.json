Try this. \n&gt; In the directory indicated by the user.home property, create a file \n&gt; called junit.properties which has the following \n&gt; \n&gt; loading=false \n&gt; \n&gt; This should solve your problem. \n&gt; \n[snip]\n\nOk. Is this the same as toggling the new flag in the Junit 3.6 Swing \nGUI?\n\nI know that setup is called everytime. I wanted to use a static class\nvariable to find out that the class was already loaded. \nThat didn&#39;t work (of course). \n\nI wonder how Erich Gamma himself solved this problem ...\n\nRegards,\nMarkus\n\n\n\n",
