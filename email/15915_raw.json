However, the logic would be more likely that it \n&gt; would try every=\r\n possible way to run the class as a JUnit 3 test, and \n&gt; then try JUnit 4 a=\r\ns a fallback (since not all JUnit 4 test classes have \n&gt; @Test).\n\nWhat woul=\r\nd happen if I have:\n\n@Test (expected=3DBar.class)\npublic void testMyFoo () =\r\n{}\n\nIf we execute junit3 style, it will find this test case, but won&#39;t see\n=\r\nthe expected=3D attribute.\n\n&gt; &gt; Oh, and since I&#39;m talking to another person=\r\n from a school with a great\n&gt; &gt; CS dept ;-), I&#39;m really interested in writi=\r\nng good docs for students\n&gt; &gt; on how to write test suites, especially for d=\r\nata structures (the focus\n&gt; &gt; of the 15-211 course). I have something that =\r\nI hacked up for our first\n&gt; &gt; homework, however, this kind of thing would b=\r\ne great to make into a\n&gt; &gt; tutorial that could be used by other classes.\n&gt; =\r\nLecture 11 from MIT 6.170 is the best pre-prepared doc I know of around \n&gt; =\r\nhere:\n&gt; \n&gt;\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu/OcwWeb/Electrical-Engineering-and-Computer-Sc=\r\nience/6-170Laboratory-in-Software-EngineeringFall2001/LectureNotes/index.ht=\r\nm\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;d be very interested in your materials, as well, if they&#39;re public=\r\nly \n&gt; available.  Thanks,\n\nThat&#39;s pretty interesting. I like the formal int=\r\nroduction to JUnit.\nHow much experience would the typical person taking thi=\r\ns course have?\n\nThe docs I have for this assignment are:\n\nAn assignment ove=\r\nrview\n\nhttp://www.contrib.andrew.cmu.edu/~bmaurer/15-211/s06/snake/docs/\n\nA=\r\nn introduction to testing:\n\nhttp://www.contrib.andrew.cmu.edu/~bmaurer/15-2=\r\n11/s06/snake/docs/testing.html\n\nI think this documentation is coming in to =\r\nthe idea of testing from a\ndifferent angle than the MIT one: my goal here i=\r\ns to enable people to\nunderstand how JUnit will help them for this assignme=\r\nnt, rather than\nto give the background of &quot;what is testing, why do we do it=\r\n, etc&quot;.\n\nJust for some fun stats about how people are doing on this assignm=\r\nent\nso far: about 50 people have submitted a solution for the problem so\nfa=\r\nr (out of 190 students) -- it is due thursday at midnight (!!!). Of\nthese p=\r\neople, about 20 pass the tests for the circular buffer based\nqueue, about 1=\r\n5 pass them for hash table. Glancing over people&#39;s code,\nit looks like the =\r\npeople who submitted test cases along with their\ncode are doing much better=\r\n on the submission system&#39;s tests (nb:\nstudents are not allowed to see thei=\r\nr results on all of our test\ncases. So they are &quot;blind&quot; in some ways).\n\nWe&#39;=\r\nre thinking of some fun ways we can put testing into the course.\nFor exampl=\r\ne, I was thinking of giving people partial credit for the\nassignment if the=\r\ny 1) wrote a patch for their own code and 2) wrote\ntest cases that caught t=\r\nheir bugs. At dinner last night with another\nTA friend, we thought about an=\r\n assignment where we would give people\n.jar files with a broken List/Queue/=\r\nHashSet/whatever and they would\nhave to 1) figure out what was wrong and 2)=\r\n write a test case.\n\nIt&#39;d be really fun to package an exercise like this an=\r\nd publish it. I\nthink that many CS courses don&#39;t teach people the testing s=\r\nkills they\nneed.\n\n-- Ben\n\n\n\n\n\n",
