I think there are a few <br/>\n&gt; articles out there that frown against it. No one likes dealing with the <br/>\n&gt; class loader if they don&#39;t have to.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; However, using system properties in something like object construction <br/>\n&gt; is a good idea. (In my opinion.) In fact I like it soo much I&#39;m going to <br/>\n&gt; blog about it. But my first rough draft has the template you need. (It <br/>\n&gt; is currently the second code snippet.) The idea is to save the system <br/>\n&gt; properties in a before method and restore in an after method. Then set <br/>\n&gt; the property you want to change before constructing the object. In your <br/>\n&gt; case it would be before loading the class.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Right, but unless I use a custom class loader, I only get to load the<br/>\nclass once.</div>",
