I think the Theories are indeed a\ns=\r\ntep in the right direction.  However, it is only a part of it.  By using\nth=\r\neories, I can test that a class implements correctly its own =91contract=92=\r\n.\nHowever, I can=92t test if a class respects the contract of its collabora=\r\ntors.\nWhat I miss is the ability to mock my collaborators in order to check=\r\n its\ncontract.\n\n \n\nThanks for the link anyway,\n\n \n\nGilles\n\n \n\n  _____  \n\nFr=\r\nom: junit@yahoogroups.com [mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com] On Behalf Of\nDavid=\r\n Saff\nSent: mardi 20 f=E9vrier 2007 15:52\nTo: junit@yahoogroups.com\nSubject=\r\n: Re: [junit] Re: Future of testing tools\n\n \n\nOn 2/16/07, Gilles Scokart &lt;g=\r\nscokart@gmail. &lt;mailto:gscokart%40gmail.com&gt;\ncom&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Finally, my last=\r\n &quot;dream&quot; is probably much less clear than the two\n&gt; previous points, and ce=\r\nrtainly more complex.\n&gt; I would like to see TDD colaborates with design by =\r\ncontract to give an\n&gt; intermediate aproach taking the best of the two world=\r\n.\n&gt; I would like to be able to define somehow the contract of an\n&gt; interfac=\r\ne, and I would like to have this contract validated when I run\n&gt; the test, =\r\nand that even when I stub or mock the object.
