You are correct and in fact I did write my\nown test runner. After a little more playing (after I\nsent the previous email) I figured it out. My problem\nwas this... I am dynamically creating the classes with\nmy own custom loader. The primary reason is partly\nwhat the junit faq/docs say about its own custom\nloader use being a problem, and that is, my testcase\nclasses and 3rd party libraries are not on the\napplication classpath. Because of this, I need a way\nto add various URL locations to my custom loader, such\nas the compiled classes output of testcases and\nlocations of any 3rd party libraries the tests may\nuse, such as jfcUnit, httpUnit, and junit. Junit is on\nour main application classpath, but the others are\nnot.\n\nMy harness actually runs embedded in the application\nbeing tested (at least for the UI side), so that you\ncan run an individual testcase right from the UI. This\nis especially helpful for developers who write unit\ntests and/or GUI automation tests that want to test\ntheir functional area as they work. Having to drop\ndown and run ant and try to specify a specific test to\nrun is a pain in the arse, especially when you have\nhundreds or thousands of them over a period of time.\n\nSo because my classes are loaded dynamicaly AND the\nselected method to execute is also dynamic, I was\nhaving trouble using junit to get the result set of\nthe test run. I want to get something similar to the\njunit output that in ant you can generate xml/html\nfrom and see a nice web report.\n\nThe solution, as I found out was\nTestSuite.createTest(Class clazz, String\nmethodNameToExecute);\n\nVery nice they already had that in place. So after a\ncouple hours, I was able to get a TestResult back and\npurposely fail some tests and see that in the test\nresult. I am quite the happy camper this weekend. I\nthought it was going to take me a long time to get all\nthis working.\n\nOriginally my harness was not based on anything, not\neven junit. But I figured I want the least common\ndenominator, JUnit in this case, so that I Can atleast\nutilize existing unit tests that our developers have\nalready done, as well as allow for the UI automation\ntestcases and a little later httpUnit automation\ntesting as well, all runnable from the one harness in\nan easy to use GUI. While tests run the harness will\nupdate the status of each testcase (or possibly wait\nuntil they are all done to reduce hindering test run\nperformance).\n\n\nThanks again.\n\n\n\n--- Russell Gold &lt;russgold@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt; On Sat, 20 Nov 2004 01:09:12 -0000,\n&gt; supreme_java_guru_1\n&gt; &lt;supreme_java_guru_1@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Hi all,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I am working on a GUI test harness that will run\n&gt; GUI tests, unit tests\n&gt; &gt; and http tests. Long story short, the GUI harness\n&gt; helps in building\n&gt; &gt; test suites. Part of this harness is allowing the\n&gt; user to add new\n&gt; &gt; testcases in a graphical tree, define the class\n&gt; name, and the methods\n&gt; &gt; of the class. All of this is embeddable within\n&gt; existing applications,\n&gt; &gt; such as a Swing GUI app to allow a developer to\n&gt; quickly assemble and\n&gt; &gt; execute individual tests without having to drop to\n&gt; the command line.\n&gt; &gt; All of this works presently. My one BIG problem is\n&gt; trying to get the\n&gt; &gt; test results from the test cases that are ran, so\n&gt; that I can embed\n&gt; &gt; something similar to the &lt;junitreport&gt; task that\n&gt; ant has. After a\n&gt; &gt; single test, or a group of tests run, I want my\n&gt; harness to show the\n&gt; &gt; output.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; My initial thought was that I did not have to\n&gt; execute a junit TestCase\n&gt; &gt; through the junit run(TestResult) method.\n&gt; Basically, I was hoping I\n&gt; &gt; could somehow get the assertXxx() output directly.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Essentially you are looking at writing your own test\n&gt; runner. You can\n&gt; look at numerous examples of this - look at how ant\n&gt; implements the\n&gt; junit task, look at the open source project JUnitEE\n&gt; or the\n&gt; JUnitServlet included with HttpUnit - all are\n&gt; examples of custom test\n&gt; runners which can produce their results as xml.\n&gt; \n\n\n\n\t\t\n__________________________________ \nDo you Yahoo!? \nThe all-new My Yahoo! - Get yours free! \nhttp://my.yahoo.com \n \n\n\n\n\n\n",
