It was working fine, but now, it&#39;s different.\n\nWith 4.1, i=\r\nt seems that the TestSuite is no more required. Then, I\ndecided to get rid =\r\nof the TestSuite classes in my project. Anyway,\nEclipse (version 3.2.1) was=\r\n complaining when I was trying to run the\ntests each time it was encounteri=\r\nng a TestSuite class. Now within\nEclipse, the only thing I have to do to ru=\r\nn my tests is to click on\nthe package I want to test and to run it as a JUn=\r\nit test; Eclipse\nseems to gather all the test classes in this particular pa=\r\nckage and it\nexecute the tests within that package. If I want to run a part=\r\nicular\ntest, I just have to perform the same operation on that particular\nt=\r\nest. That&#39;s great and it is working fine. It seems also that it\nsearch all =\r\nthe tests in a hierarchical way, so I just have to &quot;run as\na Junit&quot; on the =\r\nroot package of my project to execute the whole bunch\nof tests in my projec=\r\nt.\n\nThe second way to execute the test was within ant. I commented out my\no=\r\nld junit target in my build.xml to change it the way they explain in\nthe FA=\r\nQ.html (using the batchtest element) and it works well.\n\nMy problem is with=\r\n the third way: using the junit.swingui.TestRunner\nclass present in the ver=\r\nsion 3.8. I say &quot;present in...&quot; because this\nclass isn&#39;t available anymore =\r\nin the version 4.1. As I said in the\nbeginning of my post, I want to change=\r\n to 4.1 definitely and I like to\nknow whether I have to forget the Swing GU=\r\nI runner or not. I don&#39;t\nwant to include the java.jar of the previous versi=\r\non just to be able\nto run that runner. The problem is I liked to run my tes=\r\nts outside\nEclipse using that special Swing test runner, but if someone tel=\r\nl me\nthe reasons why it has been removed, I&#39;ll try to forget to use it anym=\r\nore.\n\nIn that case, I&#39;ll use Eclipse as a graphical user interface\nenvironm=\r\nent to run my JUnit tests and I will use the console mode\nthrought ant to q=\r\nuickly verify my code.\n\nThanks for your advice,\nAl\n\n\n\n\n",
