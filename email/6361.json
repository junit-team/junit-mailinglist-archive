Is there a way that I can finish<br/>\n&gt; &gt; both these tests in 10 minutes (max time taken by Test 1)?<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; I hope I made sense if not please let me know I will try to be <br/>\nmore<br/>\n&gt; &gt; specific.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; junit-unsubscribe@y...<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Your use of Yahoo!
