The two \n&gt; alternatives that I see are:\n&gt; \n&gt; 1)\n&gt; src/com.mycompany.myapp.MyClass src/test.mycompany.myapp.MyClassTest\n&gt; \n&gt; 2)\n&gt; src/java/com.mycompany.myapp.MyClass\n&gt; src/test/com.mycompany.myapp.MyClassTest\n&gt; \n&gt; The first one separates the packages so that the deployment \n&gt; is easier however there&#39;s need to import the tested classes \n&gt; within the test cases. The second one removes the problem of \n&gt; importing however, for anybody external to the application, \n&gt; the test cases suddenly make part of the final product.\n\nSomething like #1 is often used to ensure that unit tests have access only\nto the public members of the classes under test.  I suppose it would also be\neasy to separate test and production code when packaging for a release, but\nI&#39;ve used choice #2 for that.  Now, there&#39;s no harm in shipping tests with\nproduction code.  End users, especially if they&#39;re using your &quot;product&quot; to\ncreate one of their own, may appreciate very much that you include tests;\nplease consider it.\n\nCraig Demyanovich\n\n",
