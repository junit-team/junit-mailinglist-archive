I might have something like this:\n\npublic abstr=\r\nact AbstractThingy {\n  // some concrete methods in here that need testing\n =\r\n ...\n}\n\nBased on this, I would name my test class: AbstractThingyTest\n(alth=\r\nough it&#39;s not abstract itself).\n\nWhen I run JUnit in Eclipse, everything is=\r\n fine and dandy. Running it\nfrom within Maven however seems to make this te=\r\nst not run. So I tried\nrenaming the test to simply: ThingyTest. When I run =\r\nthis, it does in\nfact run.\n\nAnyone else encountered something similar? I su=\r\nspect it&#39;s a bug and it\nshould be looking for the keyword &quot;abstract&quot; instea=\r\nd of any file or\nclass with the word &quot;Abstract&quot; in it.\n\nThoughts?\n\nJosh\n\n\n\n",
