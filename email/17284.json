But since we&#39;re already in this territory...<br/>\n<br/>\nI recently had the great pleasure of reading the entirety of DeMarco and <br/>\nLister&#39;s _Peopleware_ in a single day (half of it on the beach, no <br/>\nless).  One idea from the book really struck me.  I don&#39;t remember the <br/>\nexact wording, so I&#39;ll inaccurately paraphrase it: &quot;companies that <br/>\nmerely want to keep their best customers can make do with less quality <br/>\nthan those that want to keep their best employees.&quot;  Customers only want <br/>\ngood-enough products.  Your best employees are only really satisfied <br/>\nwith rock-solid products that they&#39;re proud to show their kids.  Of <br/>\ncourse, companies that begin losing their best employees won&#39;t be able <br/>\nto keep their best customers forever...<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is a provocative statement, and I&#39;m not sure if I really believe it <br/>\nyet.  If it is true, then how does this impact how we think about <br/>\nsoftware testing?<br/>\n<br/>\n    David Saff</div>",
