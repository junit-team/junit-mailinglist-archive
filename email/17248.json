The principle behind this choice is that tests<br/>\n&gt; should be order-independent.

As I think about it, there&#39;s still another reason not to <br/>\ninitialize objects in the constructor: test instance creation happens <br/>\nwell before the test runs, so if too much initialization happens in the <br/>\nconstructor, one might run out of memory before running any tests. Also, <br/>\nthis could wreak havoc with test resources. Imagine what happens if each <br/>\ntest tries to grab (and hold) a database connection!<br/>\n<br/>\nSo it&#39;s good news: there&#39;s still at least one very good reason why <br/>\ninitializing in the constructor is different from using setUp(). I guess <br/>\nI&#39;ve been right for the wrong reason. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for the clarification.<br/>\n<br/>\nStill, seeing as NUnit pools test instances, I think it&#39;s worth not <br/>\nrelying on JUnit creating separate test instances.<br/>\n<br/>\nTake care.<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJ.
