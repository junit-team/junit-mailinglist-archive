They hav=\r\ne to manually select to use the new version that has just appeared in the r=\r\nepo, and this way if their tests start failing, they will know that they ca=\r\nn either fix them to work with the new version of junit, or revert to the p=\r\nrevious version.\n\nInteresting.  I was under the impression that it was poss=\r\nible to\nsimply depend on the _latest_ version of a package--indeed, that th=\r\ne\nability to get upgraded versions automatically was one of the\nbenefits/ri=\r\nsks of maven.  Perhaps I&#39;ve just learned something new.\n\n   David Saff\n\n&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n I am considering of taking up on this task with pushing junit to the publi=\r\nc Maven repo, but I have to first learn what is exactly the process for thi=\r\ns (perhaps signing up at Apache as contributor, or smt).\n&gt;\n&gt; Bogdan\n&gt;\n&gt; ---=\r\n In junit@yahoogroups.com, David Saff &lt;david@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; On Tue, Aug =\r\n17, 2010 at 6:28 PM, pniederw &lt;pniederw@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt; &gt; I&#39;ve noticed that =\r\nJUnit includes an (outdated) version of Hamcrest.
