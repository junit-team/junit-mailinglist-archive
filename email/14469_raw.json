Rainsberger wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt;  &gt; What are you afraid might break here?\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; Most of my exception classes are immutable value objects that don&#39;t care\n&gt;  &gt; if they&#39;re passed null through the constructor, so there&#39;s nothing to\n&gt;  &gt; test that the compiler isn&#39;t already testing.\n&gt; \n&gt; My exception classes may be more complicated than yours. I generally\n&gt; have at least two constructors, including one that takes a root cause.\n&gt; Typically I try to give my constructors correct exception chaining\n&gt; functionality in both Java 1.3 and earlier and Java 1.4 and later.\n&gt; Getting that right is tricky since you have to override several methods\n&gt; with detailed and weird semantics. One example can be found at\n&gt; \n&gt; http://cvs.jaxen.codehaus.org/viewrep/jaxen/jaxen/src/java/main/org/jaxen/JaxenException.java\n&gt; \n&gt; Look at versions 1.7 through 1.12. There were several bug fixes along\n&gt; the way, all of which had to be tested with unit tests.\n\nI saw one line of code in there that made me shake my head:\n\n  if (cause == this) throw new IllegalArgumentException(&quot;Exception \ncannot be its own cause&quot;);\n\nSince I almost never assign exception objects to variables -- but rather \ntype &quot;throw new MyException(message, cause);&quot;, who writes code that \ncould possibly try to assign an exception as its own cause? Where have \nyou been working?! :)\n-- \nJ. B.
