When I\n&gt; &gt; observed that I could solve many of the same problems by writing\n&gt; &gt; smaller, more focused tests, not only did I stop wanting to log\n&gt; &gt; assertions, but my designs improved and I delivered more solid\n&gt; &gt; features sooner. I believe that if JUnit logged its assertions, then\n&gt; &gt; that would have robbed me of this experience.\n&gt;\n&gt; First up I work with Phil and we&#39;ve had this discussion a few times in\n&gt; the past. For the most part I don&#39;t think I would use this feature a\n&gt; whole ton but there is one case that I can of.\n&gt;\n&gt; If I&#39;m invited to come and help with a project which is struggling\n&gt; with their tests (not having done TDD from the start), I can see using\n&gt; the log files as a way of helping me better understand what&#39;s going\n&gt; on. Are there tests without assertions? Are there tests with many\n&gt; assertions? etc.\n&gt;\nI would never claim that logging assertions is useless. I will always  \nclaim that logging assertions does not deserve to be a core feature of  \nJUnit. It should be an extension, and if JUnit makes that extension  \nhard to write, then it&#39;s time to improve JUnit.\n----\nJ. B.
