To add some custom test failure handling (take a screenshot on test failure). However I noticed that the failed() method is invoked after the @after method is executed. Currently we are using the @after method to close the browser. So we need to execute takeAScreenShot() after a test has failed, and before the @after method is exeuted. Any suggestions? I didn&#39;t see a way to do this, without making some major changes to TestWatcher.</div>",
