    "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1397612093\">What&#39;s attractive to me about Kent Beck&#39;s test-driven development is it<br/>\nholds the promise and possibility of being a practical crossover between<br/>\nthe get-the-code-out-the-door world of majority commercial practice and<br/>\nthe well-meaning and sometimes practical but esoteric design-by-contract<br/>\nworld of Eiffel, between testing as a means of finding and eliminating<br/>\nbugs and the view that programs are proofs.  These are worlds in<br/>\ncollision. If we are to be our best, they oughtn&#39;t be.<br/>\n<br/>\nA test-driven, test-first approach to software composes specific<br/>\nrequirements stated as predicate assertions, and then develops codes<br/>\nwhich fulfill them.  Intellectual manageability is imposed by<br/>\nrefactoring.  Surely, at some point of richness, the tests themselves<br/>\nshould be refactored.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut I wonder about these SUnit derivatives: Oughtn&#39;t there be investment<br/>\nin an idea that a suitably built, beautifully crafted set of tests<br/>\nshould in itself consitute an executable program fulfilling its own<br/>\nrequirements?  Sure, maybe it isn&#39;t efficient enough, or is too mired in<br/>\nthe language of predicates to relate to business needs, or can&#39;t express<br/>\nthat elliptic integral that needs evaluating, but might not there be a<br/>\nnotation that does?  Surely, a SCHEME and especially a Python have a set<br/>\nof mechanisms that could realize such a dream.<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJan Theodore Galkowski (o°)<br/>\nThe Smalltalk Idiom<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jtgalkowski@...\">jtgalkowski@...</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.algebraist.com\">http://www.algebraist.com</a></div>",
