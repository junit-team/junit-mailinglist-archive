If not, then I&#39;m not sure how much this \nis an MVC application. :) (Rude, but true.)\n\nIf I were given this feature to test and I couldn&#39;t do what I describe \nin the previous paragraph, I&#39;d use HtmlUnit to write the test. I highly \nrecommend it. I like Cactus, but I don&#39;t know how to answer your \nspecific question about Cactus. One option is to read _JUnit in Action_. \nAnother is to hope Vince Massol is reading this group these days.\n-- \nJ. B.
