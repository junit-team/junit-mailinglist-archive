The<br/>\nexception is caught by the BeforeAndAfterRunner which invokes addFailure<br/>\nexecuting &quot;notifier.fireTestFailure(...).<br/>\n<br/>\nNone of the actual test methods for this test get executed as expected.<br/>\nHowever, in the eclipse plugin the node for that test is green as are all of<br/>\nthe subnodes for the methods. The nodes don&#39;t have the check annotation, but<br/>\nno indication that a failure occured is provided. The exception message is<br/>\ncompletely eaten. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe only way I was able to determine what why that tests was not run was to<br/>\ndebug into the Junit4.1 code.<br/>\n<br/>\nIs this a know issue, or might I be missing something?<br/>\n<br/>\nthanks!<br/>\n--<br/>\nView this message in context: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.nabble.com/Failure-in-%40Before-not-reflected-in-Eclipse-plugin-runner-t1591178.html#a4317937\">http://www.nabble.com/Failure-in-%40Before-not-reflected-in-Eclipse-plugin-runner-t1591178.html#a4317937</a><br/>\nSent from the JUnit - User forum at Nabble.com.</div>",
