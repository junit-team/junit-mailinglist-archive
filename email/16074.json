( Here I mean commercial project rather than<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; open-source project. )<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; I tend to see it taking longer. Considering that you are least doubling <br/>\n&gt;&gt; (is this an english<br/>\n&gt;&gt; verb? :-) ) the quantity of code you write I would say this is the reason.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I want to emphasize the point again (already made by Kent and J.B.) that <br/>\n&gt; this type of reasoning assumes that the limiting factor in developing <br/>\n&gt; software is typing out the code.  I encourage developers to watch themselves <br/>\n&gt; or their team for a day to observe what percentage of the time is really <br/>\n&gt; spent in typing code vs. other activities.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; If the limiting factor were typing then yes, writing twice as many lines of <br/>\n&gt; code would take longer.  If the limiting factor is really other activities: <br/>\n&gt; communicating with the rest of the team, understanding the problem, <br/>\n&gt; designing, finding and fixing errors, then it is not inconceivable that <br/>\n&gt; practicing TDD with JUnit can give you an overall speedup.  The trick is <br/>\n&gt; learning how to integrate JUnit as part of all of these other <br/>\n&gt; activites--activities which all software developers perform.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; That has been my personal experience and the experience of our teams writing <br/>\n&gt; commercial software (usually with fixed-time, fixed-price contracts) for the <br/>\n&gt; last 5 years.  Consistent JUnit testing by the whole team--using <br/>\n&gt; TDD--decreases the time it takes to produce production-ready software.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Sorry but you hit one of my hot buttons.  :-)  Programming is NOT about the <br/>\n&gt; typing.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Jeff<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Jeff I would actually agree with you that this worked for you and the team, if you would not cut my <br/>\nsentence in half. Than you will see I am not talking about typing vs programming.<br/>\n<br/>\ncheers,<br/>\n<br/>\n./alex<br/>\n--<br/>\n.w( the_mindstorm )p.<br/>\n<br/>\nps: sorry you hit another hot button.. half sentences are half truth</div>",
