While I agree with a lot of the \nJUnit philosophy, I  have one major concern with it.  Perhaps there \nare articles out there that address this, but I can&#39;t find any of \nthem.\n\nAs I look into JUnit, it seems that each class either has to do one \nof the following:\n\n\textend TestCase \n\timplement Test.  \n\textend some other class that implements Test.  \n\nAs we all know, Java doesn&#39;t support multiple inheritance.  You can \nonly extend TestCase or you business class, but not both.  If you \nwant to use JUnit with a derived class, it seems you have to \nimplement a lot of methods from the TestCase interface -- which \nisn&#39;t practical.\n\nWhat are some of the ways people use JUnit to test classes that are \nderived classes?   Are there splinter projects that address this \ndeficiency?  Or is JUnit a poor fit for derived classes?\n\nGlenn Robitaille\n\n\n\n\n",
