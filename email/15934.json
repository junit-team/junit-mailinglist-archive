Meanwhile, I&#39;d <br/>\n&gt; like to talk with you about Java 3D. I&#39;m trying to make a little <br/>\n&gt; exploration in sensorial capacity, but how to test it? Do I need to <br/>\n&gt; make a Java 3D application inside the test or is there a more elegant <br/>\n&gt; solution?<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You&#39;ll have to fill me in on what you mean by &quot;sensorial capacity&quot;.  I <br/>\nhave some experience with Java3D.  The approach that worked the best is <br/>\nsimilar to what UI people call &quot;Humble Dialog&quot;: try to keep the actual <br/>\nrendering isolated to a very thin layer on top of a rich model.  This <br/>\nway, you can test the colors, positions, and relationships of objects <br/>\nwithout even referencing the Java3D API.  You may be able to get the <br/>\nrendering layer so thin that you can trust it after manual inspection <br/>\nand user testing, or you may need to use some other acceptance testing <br/>\ntechnique.  Good luck,<br/>\n<br/>\n    David Saff</div>",
