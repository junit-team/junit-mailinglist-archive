    "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2137310673\"><blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">&gt; This argument assumes there is only one way<br/>\n&gt; to write tests and that any way that write either more or fewer tests<br/>\n&gt; is wrong.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>That was absolutely not my point (I added &quot;IMHO&quot; on purpose).  Sometimes <br/>\nwriting one test is enough, sometimes writing 10,000 tests is not <br/>\nenough.  It depends on the complexity of the method you test and your <br/>\nconfidence in that method.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn your case, if you have 20 statements, you have 2.43e18 possible <br/>\npermutations (let&#39;s take the simpliest case where you only permute 20 <br/>\ndifferent statements).  Maybe you will find useful to test all <br/>\npermutations (I have nothing against it), if you have 40 rules and want <br/>\nto all 8.15e47 permuations it&#39;s also fine with me.  But I don&#39;t think <br/>\nthat that it&#39;s realistic to test all and every permutation, but that&#39;s <br/>\nonly _my_ point of view.  If you think that you need total confidence <br/>\nand your computer is fast enough, go ahead and test every case.  I <br/>\nreally don&#39;t have anything against that.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; That&#39;s simply not the case. JUnit, despite its name, is quite<br/>\n&gt; usable for writing larger scale tests and even for automating tests.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>And that&#39;s what I proposed in my answer.  I simply pointed out that <br/>\nsometimes testing _all_ possibilities doesn&#39;t make (much) sense and that <br/>\nyou can be reasonably confident by writing only a few tests (how many is <br/>\n*a few* is up to you).<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Why not help it be a more complete framework rather than argue it<br/>\n&gt; should not grow because &quot;real&quot; unit tests wouldn&#39;t need a proposed<br/>\n&gt; enhancement?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Have I said that JUnit should not grow???  Surely not!!!  What I <br/>\nstrongly think is that &quot;if there is a need, it should be addressed, <br/>\neither directly or indirectly&quot;.  &quot;Real&quot; unit tests often need more than <br/>\nthe standard JUnit, and I would like to hear the problems of those users <br/>\nusers more often on this newsgroup.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Our workaround to the JUnit confounding of test name with method name <br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; was to make sure all of<br/>\n&gt; our assertions include a message that indicates which test<br/>\n&gt; configuration is being used.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>That was my point in another message, explaining the mean of the &quot;name&quot; <br/>\nattribute in the TestCase class.  It was simply an explanation nothing <br/>\nmore.  I think that sometimes explaining the framework can be helpful, <br/>\nbut it&#39;s once again my point of view :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-Vladimir<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nVladimir Bossicard<br/>\nwww.bossicard.com</div>",
