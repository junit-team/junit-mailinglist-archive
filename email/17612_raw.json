There is zero chance that\n &gt;&gt; minds will be changed.\n\n &gt;  I respect your opinion, but when you complain about the noise on\n &gt;  such a low-traffic list, I find it difficult to take you seriously.\n\nI&#39;m complaining about the ratio of noise to valueable content. The ratio \nis the same whether it is a 10 message a day or 1000 message a day list.\n\n\n &gt; So many of the questions on this list are from beginners too lazy to\n &gt; use Google that, as a balance, I like these discussions (not\n &gt; theological rants, by the way--no need to insult--I, for one, am\n &gt; pragmatic in my discussion, so would that be applied theology?).\n\nThe only sane response to people too lazy to RTFAQ is to give them\na pointer to the faq.\n\nBut the &quot;Test Everything no matter&quot; subject itself is an invitation to \nflame, not a basis for rational discussion.\n\nLet alone this wonderful exchange:\n &gt; &gt; So you&#39;re recommending 100% code coverage?\n &gt; So you&#39;re recommending 0% code coverage?\n\nSigh.\nSo, enough naval gazing.\n\nI&#39;ve written a few over 300 tests, according to JUnit that are executed \nby NetBeans for my small project. Most are literally unit tests.\nFor example, the code that reads configuration files can be tested by \ngetting the values read.\n\nBut other classes are &#39;controllers&#39; for finite state machines.\nThe member functions such as process() read input, feed it to the FSA, \nand trigger state changes.\n\nWhat test design approach can decouple the Controller class from the FSA \nimplementation class?\n\nSimilarly, the FSA class calls a &#39;scribe&#39; class to record significant \nevents to a database. So the FSA is coupled to the persistance layer, \nwhich is coupled to the JDBC driver.\n\nClearly one could implement a dummy JDBC driver, but that would most \nlikely generated more bugs that just using an existing production JDBC \ndriver.\n\nSo how do folks decouple?\n-- \nPat Farrell\nhttp://www.pfarrell.com/\n\n\n",
