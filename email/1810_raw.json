But you are maybe an exception, but I&#39;m not :-)\n- you don&#39;t handle exceptions and errors in your test cases like you should treat them in a real application\n\nFor the customer:\n- if JUnit is not provided, he has to install the _right_ version if he wants to run the tests\n- what if the customer doesn&#39;t know JUnit at all?  Will he understand the test cases, asserts, test suites (...) concepts immediatly?\n- what if the customer installs JUnit, runs your tests and get a &quot;ClassCastException&quot; because he didn&#39;t overwrite the excluded.properties file?\n- and so on...\n\nInstead of test cases, I would simply write a client application that uses the product&#39;s API.  It&#39;s the best proof that the API can be used in a real application.  The customer can start from this example to make his own application.  Everybody did that, isn&#39;t it?\n\n&gt; their storage and bandwidth penalties.\n\nIt&#39;s not a storage or bandwidth problem.  It&#39;s about how you want to communicate with your customers.\n\nI just wonder : JUnit comes only with its own test code to &quot;document and validate the use of the product&quot;...\n\n-Vladimir\n\n\n\n",
