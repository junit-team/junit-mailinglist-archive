(I&#39;m sure someone has.)   What I\nwhat to do is generate a report that shows some stats on how many classes\nhave test cases and how many methods in the class under test have\ncorresponding test methods.  I have tried it a few different ways: \n\n1. Just scanning through the source folder, picking up the java files and\nthen checking if a ?Test.java file exists in a corresponding unit test\nfolder.  \n\nThis approach works well if I only cared about the file coverage, but I now\nwant info on the method coverage.  Enter method 2.  \n\n2. Use a tool that will parse through the java source and tell me all the\nmethods. I used javadoc for this, but the problem with it is that I can only\nsort through one source structure at a time, and javadoc is not so nice to\ncall programmatically (it shuts down your app after it runs once).  \n\nIf anyone has suggestions on a better was to get info on the methods in a\nclass, and other information like is the class an interface, I would love to\nhear it.  Or better yet, if anyone has seen or built a tool similar to what\nI&#39;m doing I would also love to hear about it.\n\nThanks,\n\nJohn\n\n",
