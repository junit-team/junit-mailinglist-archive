Integrated IDE support would be nice of course, but something like<br/>\nparameter to set would help for starters.<br/>\n<br/>\nI do not use the suites or categories right now but I do have tests that<br/>\nare too slow for me to run all the time. I also do not want to maintain<br/>\nseparate suite classes but rather prefer to just right-click on a package<br/>\nin IntelliJ and select &quot;run tests&quot;. And repeating that from the menu if I<br/>\nso prefer.<br/>\n<br/>\nI like to group my tests by what they test and not have many source trees,<br/>\nso currently I just temporarily disable some tests if they bother me, run<br/>\ntests for a chosen package, and the whole set later.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On 23 January 2013 11:58, Mark Levison &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mark@...\">mark@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; **<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Kevin, Colin and anyone else who is interested,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Let&#39;s imagine the scenario here. I show up at client site as part of a two<br/>\n&gt; week engagement. During the 3 days of training we discuss Hill&#39;s definition<br/>\n&gt; of a Microtest; SPiFFy; etc. Now they all understand no **good** unit test<br/>\n&gt; touches the file system, database, network etc. In addition they&#39;ve groked<br/>\n&gt; the value of creating only a small object graph for each test, max 7-8<br/>\n&gt; objects.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Here comes the hard part, they&#39;ve got legacy code. They sincerely want to<br/>\n&gt; do good stuff going forward, but their tests take ~25 minutes to run.<br/>\n&gt; Profiling indicates that there are ~35 tests over ~20 test classes that are<br/>\n&gt; slow. In almost every case slow tests are mixed in with fast tests. In<br/>\n&gt; addition many of these slow tests could be made fast (and more valuable) if<br/>\n&gt; we just made some clever use of fakes. However this changeover will take<br/>\n&gt; easily a couple of months of part time effort.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; In the world of NUnit we would just mark these as members of the category<br/>\n&gt; slow. In JUnit we either:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; - mark them as members of the category slow and resort to @suite<br/>\n&gt; annotations<br/>\n&gt; - mark them as members of the category slow and use maven tricks - helps<br/>\n&gt; the build server but not the individual developer running eclipse<br/>\n&gt; - move the slow tests to a separate source tree. Works well when you<br/>\n&gt; intentional write slow tests from scratch but not so much when you inherit<br/>\n&gt; this existing mess.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; As it stands I can waste alot of time with a client trying to overcome this<br/>\n&gt; issue when we should be practicing TDD, Mikado method, etc.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Again my key point for JUnit 5 before discussing new things like Lambda&#39;s I<br/>\n&gt; think the challenge should be to make the existing functionality as simple<br/>\n&gt; to use as possible.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Cheers<br/>\n&gt; Mark Levison<br/>\n&gt; Agile Pain Relief Consulting <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://agilepainrelief.com/notesfromatooluser\">http://agilepainrelief.com/notesfromatooluser</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; | Writing <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://agilepainrelief.com/notesfromatooluser/\">http://agilepainrelief.com/notesfromatooluser/</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Proud Sponsor of Agile Tour Gatineau Ottawa <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://goagiletour.ca/\">http://goagiletour.ca/</a>&gt; Nov<br/>\n&gt; 28, Toronto <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.torontoagilecommunity.org/display/PUBLIC/Home\">http://www.torontoagilecommunity.org/display/PUBLIC/Home</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 26 and Montreal <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://agilemontreal.ca/agile-tour-2012/\">http://agilemontreal.ca/agile-tour-2012/</a>&gt; 24<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed] </span></blockquote></div>",
