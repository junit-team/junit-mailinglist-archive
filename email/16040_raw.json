Of course it\n   will.  Either in time or=\r\n in programmers.  After all, we are talking about\n   writing more code, so =\r\nthe number of man.months is going to go up as\n   well.\n\n   The way to solve=\r\n this problem is to include testing in the planning\n   and project features=\r\n and deadlines accordingly, but for having been there as\n   well, I agree t=\r\nhat it&#39;s not always possible.\n\n   - Using debuggers less might be a good th=\r\ning *if* the developers find\n   bugs faster.  I have seen quite a few TDD e=\r\nnthusiasts choose not to use\n   debuggers for dogmatic reasons (&quot;because I =\r\nread it in a book&quot;) and then\n   spend hours writing tests or even println&#39;s=\r\n trying to reproduce a mysterious\n   bug that a breakpoint would have caugh=\r\nt in a few minutes.\n\n   Again, the solution here is to be pragmatic:  you h=\r\nave two tools at\n   your disposal (testing and debugger), both with their p=\r\nros and cons, and\n   you&#39;d be a fool to choose to use only one.\n\n--\nCedric\n=\r\nhttp://testng.org\n\n\n\nOn 2/9/06, frank zou &lt;frankz1998@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; Hi all,\n&gt;\n&gt; After lots of reading and trying, I think I understand the f=\r\nollowing\n&gt; benefits that Junit-base testing can give us:\n&gt;\n&gt; * more robust =\r\nsystem\n&gt; * clean / good design\n&gt; * less regression bugs\n&gt; * confidence to d=\r\no refactorying, especially at the later phase of the\n&gt; project.\n&gt; * and lot=\r\ns more...\n&gt;\n&gt; These are really good things, for open-source projects where =\r\nthere is\n&gt; no deadline pressure and resource could almost be thought as\n&gt; u=\r\nn-limitted. However, for commercial software development, is this\n&gt; still p=\r\nossible ?\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Although I knew JUnit and other JUnit-based open-source too=\r\nls for a\n&gt; couple of years, my company and team never really enbrace it. Th=\r\ne\n&gt; major reason is Product Managers always want to add cool features to\n&gt; =\r\nthe system quickly while programmers find the schedule is always too\n&gt; tigh=\r\nt to spend any extra time to write testing.\n&gt;\n&gt; I know from the mail list a=\r\nnd books that we can take lots of advantage\n&gt; of JUnit-based testing, I mys=\r\nelf have no real hands-on experience on\n&gt; it. So here are my questions:\n&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n * Will Junit-based testing make the project time longer or shorter ?\n&gt; Any=\r\n hard statistic data ? ( Here I mean commercial project rather than\n&gt; open-=\r\nsource project. )\n&gt;\n&gt; * One intersting point I found is that after Junit-ba=\r\nsed testing is\n&gt; introduced, programmers tend to use IDE debugger much less=\r\n than\n&gt; before.  This would save lots of time. Is that true ?\n&gt;\n&gt; * Some gu=\r\nys say JUnit is good for biz / util code testing. But for web\n&gt; application=\r\n development, where HTML/javascript would be root cause of\n&gt; lots of bugs, =\r\nJunit is not so powerful. Any comments ?\n&gt;\n&gt; * How can I convince managers =\r\nand programmers that JUnit-based is\n&gt; really possible for commercial softwa=\r\nre development ? Any differnece\n&gt; from open-source projects ?\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Can s=\r\nome Junit gurus shed some light here ?\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt; - Frank\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n=\r\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
