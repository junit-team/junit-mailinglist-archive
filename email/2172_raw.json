Look at the code.\n\nRight, but fail will only be called if the test fails, while assert\nwill be called to test if the test should fail.\n\nSo, code that dyamically counts assertions will count the above as\nhaving no assertions if it passes.\n\nSome people in this discussion seem to be assuming a static analysis of\nthe code to be an included, or perhaps the only, mechanism in the\nassertion counting. I can imagine (OK, no imagination, I have used)\ntools that do that, but I can&#39;t see the need for it in a lightweight\nunit testing framework. I&#39;m still unconvinced that dynamic counts are\nthat valuable, but at the very low cost of dynamic counts, the value\ndoesn&#39;t have to be too high.\n\nRegards,\n\nRob\n\n\n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nMake international calls for as low as $.04/minute with Yahoo!
