I have a test case of 6 test methods. As I\nfigured so far, each test method invokes setUp and tearDown methods\nonce. In setUp method I defined some user parameters (USER_ID, and\nsuch...) which are then passed to the test methods. I get these\nparameters from file and then put them into an arraylist (which is not\nentirely necessary, but hey...). What I need to know if there is a\nsimple way of passing the same USER_ID to all the test methods, and -\nafter all the methods have been executed - to pass the next USER_ID,\nand so forth... Basically, one USER_ID per test case execution/iteration.\n\nIterating through an arraylist in setUp method, since the testcase is\ninstantiated as many times as there are methods in that case, will\nmake it iterate through every n-th record in file, n being the number\nof methods. That&#39;s pretty much silly and useless.\n\nAnnotations (@BeforeClass and such) are a no-no.\n\nAny help is welcome, thanks.\nTomislav\n\n\n \n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n",
