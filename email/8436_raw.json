But\nwhat if a potential future interaction blows up because of a bug that is not\nexposed by the first test?  At this point I am back to being less confident\nthat my code is correct, and I have to search for the posibility that there\nis a bug in the interaction or a bug in the underlying objects that compose\nthe interaction.  At this point my scope of search is expanded costing me\nmore time than if the bug was exposed by a unit test.\n\nThink of testing a 4 wheel drive.  I could test the a component (axle) in\nunit fashion. &quot;This axle will survive 20,000 ftlbs of torque&quot;(I&#39;m not a\nmechanical engineer) This would give me level of confidence that the axle\nwould perform when put into the rest of the vehicle.  The other option is to\nskip all the unit tests and just put the truck together and take it into the\nfield and hammer it to see what breaks.  As the Test driver I would be more\nconfident in the truck that had the part unit tested.\n\nHope this helps\n\nMichael\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: news [mailto:news@...]On Behalf Of Mike Bresnahan\nSent: Friday, June 20, 2003 4:33 PM\nTo: junit@yahoogroups.com\nSubject: [junit] Re: Unit Testing vs Integration Testing\n\n\n&gt; Unit testing gives you confidence in your objects.
