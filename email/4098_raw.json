Usually, existing javadoc\nis missing badly examples in the javadoc comments. Doing it the way I\ndescribed it would bring 2 advantages :\n\n1/ You have a suite of unit test for your code that \nis always up to date (you run them often in the XP way of course)\n\n2/ You have associated documentation with examples that are always\nworking !\n\nQuestions :\n\n* It doesn&#39;t seem to be possible to get access to the source code using\neither XDoclet or Javadoc Doclet. First, is that true or is it an\noversight on my side ? How to implement it easily (of course, it is\nalways possible to go back to Javacc but I&#39;d rather not - I need\nsomething real simple). JavaML seem not to be fully ready either. Any\nidea ?\n\n* Do you guys would see an interest in this ? Would you use it ?\n\nThanks\n-Vincent\n\n\n\n",
