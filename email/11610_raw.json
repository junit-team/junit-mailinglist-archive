I have version\n1.0.0. It looks like version 1.0.1 has the elusive exactly() method. I\njust downloaded my version so this new change must have happened in\nthe past week or so. Oh well. It&#39;s late now and I have to go get my\ndaughter from day care. I&#39;ll pick up on this tomorrow. Thanx J.B.!\n\nCliff\nBTW:\nI was toying with the after() and onConsecutiveCalls() stuff and I\nstarted getting some interesting but inconsistent results. I&#39;ll write\nback tomorrow.\n\n--- In junit@yahoogroups.com, &quot;J. B.

Rainsberger&quot; &lt;jbrains@r...&gt;\nwrote:\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; Yes. Since it&#39;s just a stub, it&#39;s set up simply to return your\nvalue.\n&gt; &gt;  &gt;\n&gt; &gt; That&#39;s what I thought.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;  &gt; Invoke verify() at the end of the your test /and/ set the\n&gt; &gt; expectation to\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; &quot;at least five calls&quot; and not &quot;at least once&quot;, as you&#39;re doing\nnow. (I\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; don&#39;t know the precise syntax.)\n&gt; &gt;  &gt;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; That&#39;s what I need. I need the precise syntax to enforce a given\n&gt; &gt; number of invocations. There is no atLeastNumTimes() method that I can\n&gt; &gt; find to enforce this. I only see once() and atleastOnce() methods.\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; So change what you pass to expects(), then be sure to invoke\n&gt; &gt; verify() at\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; the end of the test.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Interestingly I haven&#39;t had the need to invoke verify at the end of my\n&gt; &gt; tests. I know it&#39;s good practice but it appears as though JMock gives\n&gt; &gt; immediate verification.\n&gt; \n&gt; It does, but only if something unexpected happens, and not if the \n&gt; something expected doesn&#39;t happen. So the 6th invocation fails fast,\nbut \n&gt; not the missing 5th.\n&gt; \n&gt;  &gt; Anyhows, what I really need is a good example\n&gt; &gt; of how to setup an expectation for a given number of invocations on a\n&gt; &gt; single method. I also want to incorporate different return values for\n&gt; &gt; each invocation. In essence what I&#39;m mocking is a custom interator.\n&gt; &gt; Could someone give me a good how-to on this?\n&gt; \n&gt; Let&#39;s see...\n&gt; \n&gt; It looks like you can use exactly().\n&gt; \n&gt; blah.expect(exactly(5))....\n&gt; \n&gt; Have you tried that yet?\n&gt; -- \n&gt; J.
