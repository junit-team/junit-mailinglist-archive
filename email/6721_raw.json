What blew me away was how quickly\neveryone I asked said &quot;You bet, when do you need it?&quot;.\n\nIn the same vein, I have Bryan Dollary extolling the virtues of IDEA\nfor TDD work (while I make the case for Eclipse), James Newkirk on\nNUnit (and if you&#39;re sing C# & NUnit, watch for James&#39; upcoming book\non the subject), Kay Pentecost on VBUnit, and a writeup on Agile\nModeling by Scott Ambler.\n\n&gt; But  I&#39;d still be gushing about the book if I wasn&#39;t a contributor. \n&gt; It all pays the same.  :-)\n\n&quot;Fame & glory, kid...
