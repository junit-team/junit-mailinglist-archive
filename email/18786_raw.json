The T1\n&gt; developer is not allowed to=\r\n refactor the &quot;architecture&quot; to aid testing\n&gt; and so to implement testing i=\r\ns actually very hard work and you end up\n&gt; being the only one who cares.  I=\r\nt&#39;s very frustrating.\n\nHi Shane,\n\nThank you for the correction.  I should h=\r\nave mentioned T3 developers\nwho advance on the technical career ladder (as =\r\nopposed to the\nmanagerial ladder) and become architects.  T3 architects who=\r\n don&#39;t\nthink about testability when designing the system are probably more\n=\r\n&quot;harmful&quot; than T3 managers.\n\nAlberto\n\nhttp://www.junitfactory.com\nGenerate =\r\nJUnit tests.
