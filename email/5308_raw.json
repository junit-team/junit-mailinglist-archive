Rainsberger [mailto:jbr@...]\n&gt;&gt; &gt;...\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;...\n&gt;...\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Do you have experience to back up this statement? I started learning\n&gt;&gt; Smalltalk using a combination of:\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; * Well-named classes\n&gt;&gt; * A primer on the syntax\n&gt;&gt; * SUnit\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;Agreed, I learned about Smalltalk whitout the benefit of SUnit.\n\nPoor man.\n\n&gt;When starting with java, I tried to do it the same way (VisualAge\noffers\n&gt;similar funcionality in the scrapbook).\n\nI like the scrapbook in VAJ. Always did.\n\n&gt;Switching to forte, I had a test class with a main method, where I\ntyped\n&gt;some code to see what it did.\n&gt;I believe that&#39;s a very common way to explore any programming\nlanguage...\n\nAn interpreter is best: I liked that when a first started with Ruby; I\nliked that with Smalltalk and I&#39;ve seen one or two in Java. I think\nthat interpreters are the perfect way to take the very first steps with\na language. Next is writing tests.\n\n&gt;Now I put all that exploring code in testcases, so I can use them as\n&gt;documentation later. \n\nExcellent. EVERYONE PAY ATTENTION.\n\n&gt;Wouldn&#39;t want to start counting how often I &quot;explored&quot;\n&gt;Class.isAssignableFrom(Class) - amongst others. Whenever I read the\n&gt;javadoc:\n&gt;\n&gt;   &quot;Determines if the class or interface represented by this Class\nobject\n&gt;is\n&gt;either the same as, \n&gt;    or is a superclass or\n&gt;    superinterface of, the class or interface represented by \n&gt;    the specified Class parameter.&quot;\n\nWould this not be clearer?\n\n    Determines whether the object &#39;that&#39; can be assigned to an object\n    whose type is the current Class object.\n\nThis is a special case of writing a comment that describes the\nimplementation, rather than explains the intent. A stupid comment, in\nother words.\n\n&gt;I start panicking. The method name does not help either\n&gt;(Class.isSuperTypeOf(Class) would be clearer).\n\nI think isAssignableFrom() is a fine name, and it even works without\ndocumentation:\n\n    assertTrue( this.getClass().isAssignableFrom(that) );\n\nClear enough for me. Even better would be:\n\n    assertTrue( this.canBeAssignedTo(thatClass) );\n\nThe method should just be on Object, or mixed in from\nRuntimeTypeInformation. Shame there are no mixins in Java...\n\n&gt;    public void testIsAssignableFrom(){\n&gt;        assertTrue(Number.class.isAssignableFrom(Integer.class));\n&gt;    }\n&gt;\n&gt;is much clearer to me, poor programmer.\n&gt;Meaning: &quot;an instance of class Integer can be assigned to a variable\nof\n&gt;type\n&gt;Number&quot;.\n\nPerfect.\n\n&gt;or &quot;Number is a super class of Integer&quot;.\n\nLess perfect; the above is more to the point. Number could, after all,\nbe an interface that Integer implements.\n\n&gt;BTW, JB, is this what you call learning tests ?\n\nYes, although I saw Kent first use the term in his Test-Driven\nDevelopment book.
