The only thing that can break is an invalid (null)\n&gt; reference, and you&#39;ve probably testing for that somewhere else.\n&gt; \n\nI followed that path until I was bitten some day: When delegating more than\none method - eg in a wrapper - I often code the delegation methods by typing\nin the first method, copying this method as often as needed and then renaming\nmethod names and delegation calls. Doing that without tests - and without a\npair coder - I introduced two nasty bugs... This becomes even more of an\nissue when the interface of both delegate and delegee grows, I let the IDE create\nthe method stub and evetually forget to fill in the method body. \n\nHas someone detected a fool-proof (Johannes-proof) way of writing delegation\ncode to prevent that kind of error? I guess delegation should part of the\nlanguage spec the same way implementation inheritance is. For instance, Ruby\ndoes that in a nice way.\n\nJohannes\n\n-- \n+++ GMX - Mail, Messaging & more  http://www.gmx.net +++\nNEU: Mit GMX ins Internet. Rund um die Uhr f�r 1 ct/ Min. surfen!\n\n\n",
