    "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-888859241\">Dear all<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve been TDD come code, which is fine; I&#39;ve a number of tests that show<br/>\nthe code to be working how I&#39;d expect.  I&#39;ve now come to add some more<br/>\ncode within another (set of) class(es).  In doing so I note some<br/>\ncommonality between this and the old code, so have abstracted it.  The<br/>\nold code still works - I know this because of its unit tests.  Now the<br/>\nquestion should I (at point of extraction) move/create a set of tests<br/>\nfor the extracted functionality?  Initially (pragmatically) I think not<br/>\nbecause the extraction is due to hygienic reasons and the code is<br/>\nalready covered (as I am testing the behaviour of class A - the fact it<br/>\nnow uses class B seems irrelevant) and I don&#39;t have time (the usual<br/>\ncaveat) to do this...  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd yet if I&#39;d hit upon the need for this extraction earlier in the<br/>\nprocess I&#39;d have written B first along with a set of tests then written<br/>\nA to use B and injected a fake B into A to drive its tests.  So from<br/>\nthat standpoint the later would have resulted in better unit test<br/>\ncoverage than the former. <br/>\n<br/>\nHow do other people handle this type of refactoring and unit test<br/>\nmanagement and what they do?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks  <br/>\n<br/>\nJonathan<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------<br/>\nServicePower Business Solutions Ltd<br/>\nPetersgate House, St Petersgate<br/>\nStockport, SK1 1HE<br/>\nENGLAND<br/>\nTel: +44(0)161 476 2277<br/>\nemail: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:j.oddy@...\">j.oddy@...</a><br/>\nweb: www.servicepower.com<br/>\n------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",
