Apologies for unclear writing (perhaps,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;unclear thinking ...)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; It happens.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;I want to write a method M which given a class C which is supposed<br/>\n&gt; &gt;to implement interface I will return a suite which runs the abstract test<br/>\n&gt; &gt;cases ATC for I with respect to the implementation C. I happens to be<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Graph and the C&#39;s are implementations of Graph and there are enough<br/>\n&gt; &gt;C&#39;s that writing out explicit subclasses of ATC for each C is a pain.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;This makes it easy for the writers of the different C&#39;s to run the<br/>\n&gt; &gt;abstract test cases.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; With the greatest love and respect, that first sentence does not appear to<br/>\n&gt; be English. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It&#39;s English. Perhaps rather more tersely punctuated than desirable for easy<br/>\nparsing ...<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; You have an abstract test case AbstractTestGraph. There are a bunch of<br/>\n&gt; implementations (subclasses) of Graph. You want to be able to generate on<br/>\n&gt; the fly test cases for each implementation (subclass) of Graph.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yes. Specifically I don&#39;t want to have to write out essentially the same code<br/>\nonce for each test subclass; the concrete test class differ only in their names<br/>\n(incidental, although useful when they fail ...) and in the class of object they<br/>\ninstantiate (some subclass of Graph).<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; If that is what you want, then it shouldn&#39;t be that hard. Create a<br/>\n&gt; TestSuite object consisting of dynamic subclasses of AbstractTestGraph,<br/>\n&gt; each of which overrides makeGraph() to answer its particular implementation<br/>\n&gt; of Graph. As I wrote, dynamic invocation handlers should do the job.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It&#39;s generating those dynamic subclasses of AbstractTestGraph that&#39;s the<br/>\nproblem for me. Am I missing something in the reflection API? <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;What&#39;s important is not to be able to create a suite of them all (although<br/>\n&gt; &gt;that might be nice), but to be able to trivially able to create a suite<br/>\n&gt; &gt; for each one to be plugged into the locally appropriate test-cases.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; You want to generate code? or generate the implementation at runtime?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>The latter - as an implementation of &quot;write concise code which does the<br/>\njob&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;[When I say &quot;suite&quot; am I being sloppy? I really mean &quot;a test that runs<br/>\n&gt; &gt;lots of tests&quot;.]<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Tests don&#39;t run tests. TestRunners run tests.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I really mean &quot;a test that when run results in the running of lots of tests.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;So far as I can tell, it would be easy in Java if classes nested inside<br/>\n&gt; &gt;methods<br/>\n&gt; &gt;were allowed to be public. I suspect the restriction was not reviewed when<br/>\n&gt; &gt;they added reflection to the official language ...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; They are if they are class-level (static).<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yes, but then they&#39;re not nested inside methods, which rather loses the point<br/>\nof parametisation. Hmm. Perhaps I&#39;m missing a trick with non-static inner<br/>\nclasses. (The trouble with dynamic inner classes being that their constructors<br/>\nwon&#39;t match the pattern expected by junit ...)<br/>\n<br/>\nWill cogitate. Much other stuff to do as well.
