The notion seems to be th=\r\nat each method in a class, or perhaps each public method, should have a uni=\r\nt test.\n\nI think this is wrong. I think, as J.B. said, that in such a case =\r\nyou should concentrate on testing features, not simply methods.\n\nI would sa=\r\ny that for new code, where you&#39;re writing tests along with your production =\r\ncode, it might make sense to try for a test per (public) method. But that&#39;s=\r\n because in this case you have the benefit of thinking about the testing at=\r\n the time you&#39;re writing the code. I think you&#39;re more likely to design you=\r\nr code in such a way as to have this make more sense. (The &quot;testing influen=\r\nces design&quot; notion.)\n\nThe problem I see with mindlessly (or even mindfully)=\r\n writing a test for each method, just to satisfy someone&#39;s idea that code c=\r\noverage is good, is that you&#39;re likely to (1) invest a lot of (or even a li=\r\nttle) time; and (2) generate a lot of test code (which will have to be main=\r\ntained, don&#39;t forget), for what will turn out to be little or no benefit. I=\r\n would bet that the marginal number of bugs found by &quot;complete&quot; per-method =\r\ntests over a more sensible per-feature approach, both now and forever in th=\r\ne future, is very close to zero. At least that&#39;s my impression based on my =\r\nown experiences.\n\nMore is not always better.\n\nI would be very curious to kn=\r\now if anyone can report on actual (measured, quantitative) experiences that=\r\n either support or refute this.\n\n - Alan Bram\n   alan@...\n\r\n------=_NextPart_000_000F_01C1CE69.6C5E1E80\r\nContent-Type: text/html;\n\tcharset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN&quot;&gt;\n&lt;HTML&gt;&lt;HEAD&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;META http-equiv=3DContent-Type content=3D&quot;text/html; charset=3Diso-8859-1=\r\n&quot;&gt;\n&lt;META content=3D&quot;MSHTML 6.00.2600.0&quot; name=3DGENERATOR&gt;\n&lt;STYLE&gt;&lt;/STYLE&gt;\n&lt;=\r\n/HEAD&gt;\n&lt;BODY bgColor=3D#ffffff&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;In this di=\r\nscussion, apparently we have been talking \nabout &quot;retrofitting&quot; unit tests =\r\nfor old code that never before had them.
