Why do you have it there instead of in the test itself?\n\nIf you&#39;re using this as a &quot;catch-all&quot; test that you want to run after \nevery other test, that&#39;s still probably a bad idea (for the reasons J. \nB. gave).\n\nYou probably want to use some flavor of a TestDecorator (see \nhttp://junit.sourceforge.net/javadoc/junit/extensions/TestDecorator.html)\n\ndwh\n\n\nJ.

Rainsberger wrote:\n\n&gt; Ranjeet Sahay wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Hi,\n&gt; &gt; I am bit curious as when tearDown is called, as what point resources are\n&gt; &gt; void.\n&gt; &gt; Simple Test code :\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; 1. protected void tearDown() {\n&gt; &gt; 2.    System.out.println(&quot;tear down 1&quot;);\n&gt; &gt; 3.     assertTrue(&quot;Size is incorrect&quot;,v.size()==1);\n&gt; &gt; 4.     System.out.println(&quot;tear down 2=&quot;+v.size());\n&gt; &gt; 5.   }\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Lines 2&3 are executed but not line 4. Is this expected behavior ?\n&gt;\n&gt; It depends: what&#39;s v.size()? I bet it&#39;s not 1.\n&gt;\n&gt; If tearDown() throws an exception, life is bad, because it stops\n&gt; executing and you never find out why. I think this has been discussed at\n&gt; length in this group, but since I never throw an exception from\n&gt; tearDown(), I don&#39;t know anything about it.\n&gt;\n&gt; To answer your question, read the source for method runBare():\n&gt;\n&gt; try {\n&gt;      setUp();\n&gt;      runTest();\n&gt; }\n&gt; catch (...) {\n&gt;      ...\n&gt; }\n&gt; tearDown();\n&gt;\n&gt; This is executed for each test.\n\n\n\n\n\n",
