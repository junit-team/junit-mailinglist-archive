Mockito is interesting, in that the\nr=\r\nelease notes, how-to doc, etc., are baked directly into the javadoc.\nThis d=\r\nidn&#39;t immediately appeal to me, because I&#39;ve found that\nlong-form text and =\r\ncode samples in javadoc are a pain to maintain,\nbecause of the interaction =\r\nof HTML and Java syntaxes.  Do you know if\nthe mockito team uses tooling th=\r\nat makes it easier?\n\n&gt; The process would then be a case generating the java=\r\ndoc into the site\n&gt; repo on github, committing and publishing it.\n&gt;\n&gt; I thi=\r\nnk this should be as automated as possible.\n\nYes.  Of the code I have perso=\r\nnally written for JUnit over the last 8\nmonths, easily over half has been a=\r\nutomation of build, release, and\ndocumentation.\n\n&gt; JUnit is a bit off on\n&gt; =\r\nit&#39;s founder&#39;s XP credentials.\n\nTo be fair, to my knowledge, no one&#39;s getti=\r\nng paid to work 40-hour\nweeks on JUnit, so other XP practices also have to =\r\nbend.  :-)\n\n&gt; , and part of that seems to be an allergy\n&gt; to Maven.\n\nI&#39;m no=\r\nt sure about allergy.  JUnit predates the first glimmer of maven\nby at leas=\r\nt three years, and we&#39;ve been fairly enthusiastic about\ncommunity contribut=\r\nions to make working with JUnit and maven easier.\n\n&gt; We should be able to r=\r\nelease JUnit from a button on a build\n&gt; server :)\n\nDonations toward acquiri=\r\nng cycles happily accepted.  ;-)\n\n   David Saff\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; On 08/09/2011 22:43,=\r\n Stefan Birkner wrote:\n&gt;&gt; The information about JUnit is across three diffe=\r\nrent places: junit.org, junit.sourceforge.net and github.
