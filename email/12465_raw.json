B. Rainsberger and Ron Jeffries invite you to join us in OpenSpace\nat XP Day Toronto on February 19, 2005 to explore what is happening in\nthe software development market and in agile software development\ntoday. Come to network and swap ideas, and join with our invited\nexperts to influence what happens on a local scale.\n\nWithin the Agile Software Development community, people have been\nsaying for a while now that we have nearly consumed the Enthusiasts\nand the Early Adopters, and that we&#39;re up against the problem of\nCrossing the Chasm to the mainstream market of Pragmatists,\nConservatives, and Skeptics.\n\n(Learn more about the Technology Adoption Lifecycle curve at\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crossing_the_Chasm)\n\nMeanwhile, the economic conditions in the world have put competitive\npressure on agile proponents, leading to a proliferation of\ndifferentiated styles of agile: XP, Scrum, Crystal, and even to some\ngrowing corporate incursions such as Enterprise XP and announcements\nfrom Microsoft.\n\nAt the same time, owing to improved telecommunications and other\ntechnologies, and to the growth in excellent software development\nskills in countries all over the world, people who need software have\na new menu of alternative ways to get their software: home grown,\npurchased, contracted nearby, contracted overseas. Each of these\napproaches offers new challenges to those who acquire software, and to\nthose who develop software in one or more of those venues.\n\nWe have invited members of the international Extreme Programming\ncommunity via various XP-related mailing lists, as well as local\nsoftware communities in southern Ontario, eastern Canada and the\nnorth-eastern US. To help bridge the gap between industry and\nacademics, we have also invited Toronto-area software companies as\nwell as faculty and students from area universities and colleges. And\nwe anticipate that our invited speakers will drop in to lend their\nexperience to various discussions.\n\nThe agenda for our conversations in OpenSpace will be up to you, based\non your perception of the challenges and opportunities in bringing XP\nand Agile practices to your work. You will also be asked to take\nresponsibility for reporting your ideas and proposals. Your initiative\nwill be essential to our success. Organizations have used Open Space\nTechnology successfully across Canada and around the world to enable\nspirited and productive dialogue. This approach will allow you to\nfocus on those issues for which you have a passion to discover\nsolutions and strategies. An interest in software development is all\nthat you need to bring to the event. Familiarity with Agile methods,\nor a desire to know more about them will be helpful. A desire to learn\nwhat you can and to contribute what you can, is essential. It&#39;s not\nnecessary to be practicing XP or any Agile method to attend. There are\nno magic bullets here, just people with valuable experiences and a\ndesire to do better in the future.\n\nIt&#39;s not necessary to be practicing XP or any Agile method to attend.\nThere are no magic bullets here, just people with valuable experiences\nand a desire to do better in the future.\n\nGoals: By the end of this meeting, we want to have:\n\n     * Recognition of the common aspects of all agile methods, and any\n       important differences\n     * Broad understanding of what goes into the decision process for\n       selecting a software development approach: forces, alternatives,\n       dimension\n     * Strategies for individuals and groups wanting to inject more\n       Agile practices into their work\n     * New acquaintances in the software field, potentially leading to\n       new collaborations or business alliances\n     * Recommendations for actions by individuals and organizations\n       interested in software development and the agile methods\n     * Commitments from participants to carry these ideas forward to\n       the next level\n\nOur commitment to you: You will be putting in a full day of your time\nso that we can move forward toward our collective vision. In turn, as\norganizers, we make the following commitments to you.\n\n     * Individual discussion groups will have an opportunity to post\n       their results for all participants to review;\n     * Proceedings of the sessions will be published on the web by\n       Sunday evening;\n     * A voluntary directory of participants will be provided to\n       facilitate further collaboration between participants after\n       the event.\n\nTo find out more about Open Space as a meeting approach you might like\nto check out: www.spiritedorg.com, the site maintained by Toronto&#39;s\nforemost OST trainer. The meeting approach will be new for many of\nyou, so expect some pleasant surprises. An interesting story about\nwhat happened when Reebok used Open Space for Product Development can\nbe found at http://tinyurl.com/3slw2: &quot;You never know who&#39;ll bring in\nyour next 20 million dollars.&quot;\n\nYour hosts:\n\nRon Jeffries is the senior author of Extreme Programming Installed,\nand was the on-site XP coach for the original Extreme Programming\nproject. Ron has been involved with Extreme Programming and Agile\nmethods for over eight years, presenting numerous talks and publishing\npapers on the topic. Microsoft has just released Ron&#39;s latest book,\nExtreme Programming Adventures in C#. Ron is also the proprietor of\nwww.XProgramming.com, a well-known source of XP information.\n\nRon is an independent consultant, and is one of the creators of Object\nMentor&#39;s popular XP Immersion course. He has advanced degrees in\nmathematics and computer science, and has been a software developer\nfor more years than most of you have been alive. His teams have built\noperating systems, compilers, relational database systems, and a large\nrange of applications. Ron&#39;s software products have produced revenue\nof over half a billion dollars, and he wonders why he didn&#39;t get any\nof it.\n\n     I&#39;m looking forward to some exciting discussions about how things\n     are done today, how XP and the other Agile methods fit together,\n     and what we can do to make our software development lives better.\n\nJ. B. (Joe) Rainsberger is the author of JUnit Recipes: Practical\nMethods for Programmer Testing, and has spent the last four years\nbecoming a better programmer by learning how to be a better tester. He\nis a prominent member of the JUnit community, but also a regular\ncontributor to the XP community at large. He will be shaping the\nprogram of the Agile 2005 conference in Denver, Colorado as the chair\nof the tutorials committee. J. B. has recently launched a new web\nsite, www.MasterProgrammer.info, which brings together resources for\nprogrammers to move along the road from apprentice to master.\n\n     I am thrilled to make Open Space a part of XP Day Toronto 2005.\n     Tutorials are an important part of any conference, but the real\n     magic happens in the hallway conversations that dot the landscape\n     of most conferences I have attended. With Deborah Hartmann as our\n     faciliator and Ron Jeffries providing the inspiration, this\n     promises to be an enjoyable and productive event. I will even have\n     to duck out of the XP Project Room to attend a session or two!\n\nYour Facilitator:\n\nDeborah Hartmann is an active proponent of Agile practices, and is a\nCertified ScrumMaster (Practitioner). Deborah has persevered in the\nsoftware industry since the early 80&#39;s, and during her extended\nconsulting experience often thought &quot;there&#39;s got to be a better way!&quot;\nDeborah promotes approaches like XP, Scrum and OpenSpace as means to\nproduce better ideas, teams and products. Deb sponsored the &quot;Growing\nAgile Practices&quot; OpenSpace event held in Toronto in 2004. This will be\nher first opportunity to facilitate an OpenSpace event, under the\ntutelage of Larry Peterson, one of Canada&#39;s foremost OpenSpace\ntrainers.\n\n-- \nJ. B.
