Therefore, you are not testing that the connection to the=\r\n database or the that the database actually works - we assume they do becau=\r\nse they are out of our scope. This of course assumes you are not writing yo=\r\nur own JDBC driver.\n\nI was pointed to using mock objects and the like; howe=\r\nver what I ended up doing is using setup to run scripts that put specific i=\r\nnformation into the database to test conditions that I wanted - in essence =\r\njuicing the data to test the handling of that data under a limited number o=\r\nf conditions.\n\n\nChip\n-----\nProgramming: Its not just a job - its an indentu=\r\nre \n\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: Patel, Rakesh [mailto:rakesh.patel@m=\r\netapack.com]\nSent: Thursday, July 17, 2003 12:48 PM\nTo: &#39;junit@yahoogroups.=\r\ncom&#39;\nSubject: [junit] JUnit, Ant and databases\n\n\nHi,\n\nwhat is the best way =\r\nto verify database updates in the db? I really do not\nwant to write jdbc co=\r\nde in the the JUnit cases if i can avoid it.\n\nWe got round the issue of run=\r\nning specific sql scripts in the\nsetUp()/tearDown() methods by calling Ant =\r\nprogrammatically with a buildfile\ncontaining the required code. Works reall=\r\ny well and means we can use Ant\nfunctionality in our test cases.\n\nThanks\n\nR=\r\nakesh\n\n\n\nTo unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\njunit-unsubscrib=\r\ne@yahoogroups.com\n \n\nYour use of Yahoo!
