Now I fully understand why our lawyers object against CPL and I am surprised that Sun lawyers previously accepted that clause.<br/>\n<br/>\nBtw. I am trying to understand ways to make open source projects profitable[2]. So far I thought only GPL with commercial licensing is an option, but the CPL trick is also cute.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have one question, however: I can imagine buying a commercial license is good for closed source projects. But how can a commercial license be suitable for an open source project like NetBeans? If we want to stay open source, we cannot have a commercial license on one of our libraries! We need to have an open source one. We need to let 3rd parties to take parts of our IDE and use them in an open source manner. I am sure we are not the first ones to have this problem, and you have some solution, right?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks in advance for your answer. Meanwhile we&#39;ll start shaping up description of our needs with our lawyers.<br/>\n-jt<br/>\n<br/>\n[1] <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eclipse_Public_License#cite_note-patent_litigation_change-2\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eclipse_Public_License#cite_note-patent_litigation_change-2</a><br/>\n[2] <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://wiki.apidesign.org/wiki/WhyGPL\">http://wiki.apidesign.org/wiki/WhyGPL</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a>, Kent Beck &lt;kentb@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Dear Jaroslav,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Thank you for the message. It is not practical to change the license for JUnit because of the difficult of identifying and notifying contributors.

Our new lawyers seem to be concerned about the JUnit license. True, JUnit&#39;s use of Common Public License is unique and sort of archaic. I don&#39;t know about any other (important) project using this license anymore.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Right now we are holding our release and getting ready to remove JUnit from our standard installation. Silly, I know, JUnit is necessary part of any serious Java development, but there is not much we can do. Except to ask:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Don&#39;t you want to relicense JUnit to some more commonly used license? EPL would be fine. At least I have not heard any complain about EPL from our new lawyers yet. Dual licensing to CPL & EPL probably too.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Thanks for reading my post and sorry for bothering. It just make me sad to see our software being crippled due to artificial licensing constraints.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; On behalf of about 800000 active users of NetBeans IDE,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Jaroslav Tulach<br/>\n&gt; &gt; NetBeans Platform Architect<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>",
