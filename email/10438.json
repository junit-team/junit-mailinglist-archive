The problem I had was where JUnit was<br/>\ninstalled. If the directory path to the JUnit directory has a space in<br/>\nit (&quot;C:&#92;Documents and Settings&quot; in his case; &quot;C:&#92;Program Files&quot; in my<br/>\ncase), the class locator has a problem with the space. He suggested it<br/>\nmight be because it converts it to the hex %20 representation. This<br/>\ndoes not seem to cause a problem for the JAR files located through the<br/>\nclasspath, only those loaded explicitly. I moved my install directory<br/>\nfor JUnit to C:&#92;JavaDev&#92;JUnit, changed my classpath for the junit.jar,<br/>\nand it ran fine.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis should probably be in the FAQ as it seems a lot of people hit it<br/>\nunder Windows, especially as Sun&#39;s default install for their Java<br/>\ndirectory is under Program Files.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have not moved it to my Sun box to test it there yet.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;rikard_land&quot; &lt;riceland@s...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; I get the same error during installation test <br/>\n&gt; (&quot;ClassNotFoundException&quot; in test &quot;testJarClassLoading&quot;). The <br/>\n&gt; file &quot;test.jar&quot; (with path) is included in classpath, as well as <br/>\n&gt; current directory. I use Java SDK 1.4.2.03.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; JUnit seems to run fine apart from this, but I suppose I will have <br/>\n&gt; problems as soon as I start fiddling with jar files... <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Did you ever solve it?  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Regards,<br/>\n&gt; Rikard </span></blockquote></div>",
