But at\nsome point it must be used by an actual intended-to-be-public public method.\nOnce that public method has been built and tested, we can change the\nmodifier of the supposed-to-be-private method to private.  That means we\nhave to remove/comment out the tests that explicitly accessed it: we know\nthe private method is still working properly because the public method(s)\nthat use it still run green.\n\nWe can&#39;t keep all our tests; many of them are just scaffolding to help build\nprograms.  Once they&#39;re of no more use we should discard them.  This is the\nsort of refactoring of the test suites required to run all our tests in less\nthan 10 mins.  \n\nWe certainly shouldn&#39;t violate the structure of our code just to run some\ntests.  Of course using reflection to get at the private methods is a\ndifferent kettle of fish and sounds like a neat way around the problem for\nthose cases when we really need to test the private method directly.  Didn&#39;t\nsomeone say they were going to post some code? ;-)\n\nregards, APC\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: jakob@... [mailto:jakob@...]\nSent: 15 January 2001 23:52\nTo: junit@egroups.com\nSubject: [junit] Re: test with private methd\n\n\nHi There.\n\nVery often you don&#39;t need methods to be &quot;private&quot; to protect them \nfrom being called from the outside, but &quot;protected&quot; will do the job, \nallowing access only to the class + subclasses of it. \n\nHere&#39;s then some simple suggestions:\n\nA.1) Create a subclass of the class you want to test. Put this class \nin your test package.\n\nA.2) Create a simple delegation method in the subclass with public \naccess that calls the protected method. You can also put this method \ndirectly in the class you want to test, and just remove it before \nreleasing. This causes a lot of out commenting though :-)\n\nAnd something I sometimes do before testing smaller areas...\n\nB.1) change the method access to public for the duration of the test. \nThen change it back to private. This also gives some problems in, \nthat you cannot execute automatic tests.\n\n\nIf these suggestions won&#39;t do, I see no other way than looking into \nwhat reflection might do for you.\n\nRegards,\nJakob Jenkov\n\n\nTo unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\njunit-unsubscribe@egroups.com\n\n\n\n",
