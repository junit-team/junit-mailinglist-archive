    "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-526803765\">I have inherited some code which runs a suite of JUnit test cases (via<br/>\njunit.textui.TestRunner.doRun(mySuite)) and outputs the results of the<br/>\ntest case either as &quot;.&quot; for a success, or &quot;.F&quot; for a failure, followed<br/>\nby the errors and a summary of the run results. So if I have three<br/>\ntest cases in the suite, and the first and third test cases succeed,<br/>\nthen the output file looks like &quot;..F.&quot; followed by the errors and a<br/>\nsummary of how many successes/failures. There are about 80 test cases<br/>\nin the suite I&#39;m working with, and it is very time consuming and error<br/>\nprone to try to figure out which tests succeeded and which ones failed<br/>\nfrom a long list of dots and dot-F&#39;s. What I would like instead is to<br/>\nhave the report look something like this:<br/>\n<br/>\ntest-01-01: success<br/>\ntest-01-02: failure<br/>\ntest-02-01: success<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;errors&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;summary&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI have looked at the JavaDoc for junit.textui.TestRunner and there is<br/>\nno way to specify how the final report comes out, more specifically no<br/>\nway to tell it to print the name of the test case and the result<br/>\nrather than either &quot;.&quot; for success or &quot;.F&quot; for failures.<br/>\n<br/>\nCan anyone advise me how I can modify this behavior? Am I stuck and<br/>\njust need to write a parser to convert the &quot;..F.&quot; to a meaningful<br/>\nreport as to which tests succeeded or failed (as in the above example)?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks in advance for any suggestions.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--James</div>",
