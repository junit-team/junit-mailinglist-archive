In a worst case we \ncan assume that any method could throw a runtime exception as well as \ncertain language constructs such as a[n] or a.foo() (accordingly AIOOBE \nand NPE).\n  This can be slightly optimized with some cached info about possible \nmethod exceptions created from simple inter-method DFA.\n\n&gt;And I agree in this simple case that it&#39;s probably true you would want\n&gt;it to pop out of here NumericFormatException but in the abstract it&#39;s\n&gt;important for people to know the exception could occur when testing and\n&gt;decide a) they want it to fly out or b) they don&#39;t and want to do\n&gt;something else.

So even if you have\n&gt;&gt;100% code coverage there can still be nasty bugs lurking ....\n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;   Well, this is actually can be covered by the branch coverage (we \n&gt;just have to take into the account some implicit branches caused by \n&gt;exceptional execution flow), but it will obviously require more effort \n&gt;to handle all the branches.\n&gt;\n&gt;   From other hand we don&#39;t really have to cover parse method in your \n&gt;example because exceptional case most likely will affect the caller \n&gt;code and that is where erroroous outcome will caise most of the \n&gt;troubles. Though it can be easily reproduced with mocks... but of \n&gt;course not for static methods. :-)\n&gt;\n&gt;   Using DFA (like it is done in Agitator) allows to have sort of \n&gt;shortcut that reduces number of hardly possible branches. That is why \n&gt;I felt it worth to mention it here.\n&gt;\n&gt;   regards,\n&gt;   Eugene\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;From: junit@yahoogroups.com [mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com] On\n&gt;&gt;Behalf Of Eugene Kuleshov\n&gt;&gt;Sent: Monday, November 21, 2005 12:32 PM\n&gt;&gt;To: junit@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;&gt;Subject: Re: [junit] coverage testing\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;Kent,\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;Aren&#39;t you guys doing this already in Agitator?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;regards,\n&gt;&gt;Eugene\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;Kent Mitchell wrote:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;One other issue is that coverage (even path coverage) follows a\n&gt;&gt;&gt;classic interpretation of &quot;paths&quot; being based on the structure of\n&gt;&gt;&gt;the code.  But for an exception throwing language there is other\n&gt;&gt;&gt;possible &quot;paths&quot; that are triggered by behavior of the called\n&gt;&gt;&gt;code.  Consider:\n&gt;&gt;&gt;      \n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;public static void int parse (String s) {\n&gt;&gt;&gt;  return Integer.parseInt(s);\n&gt;&gt;&gt;}\n&gt;&gt;&gt;      \n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;Classically this has exactly one code path and gets 100% coverage\n&gt;&gt;&gt;if you pass in &quot;1234&quot; but behaviorally it has two paths because\n&gt;&gt;&gt;parseInt can throw an exception.  So ... you really need &quot;data\n&gt;&gt;&gt;coverage&quot; which is a nebulous concept to measure at best.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;      \n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;Kent\n&gt;&gt;&gt;      \n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n",
