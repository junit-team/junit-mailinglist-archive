I&#39;ve now come to add some more\ncode within another (set of) class(es).  In doing so I note some\ncommonality between this and the old code, so have abstracted it.  The\nold code still works - I know this because of its unit tests.  Now the\nquestion should I (at point of extraction) move/create a set of tests\nfor the extracted functionality?  Initially (pragmatically) I think not\nbecause the extraction is due to hygienic reasons and the code is\nalready covered (as I am testing the behaviour of class A - the fact it\nnow uses class B seems irrelevant) and I don&#39;t have time (the usual\ncaveat) to do this...  \n\nAnd yet if I&#39;d hit upon the need for this extraction earlier in the\nprocess I&#39;d have written B first along with a set of tests then written\nA to use B and injected a fake B into A to drive its tests.  So from\nthat standpoint the later would have resulted in better unit test\ncoverage than the former. \n\nHow do other people handle this type of refactoring and unit test\nmanagement and what they do?\n\nThanks  \n\nJonathan\n\n------------------------------------\nServicePower Business Solutions Ltd\nPetersgate House, St Petersgate\nStockport, SK1 1HE\nENGLAND\nTel: +44(0)161 476 2277\nemail: j.oddy@...\nweb: www.servicepower.com\n------------------------------------\n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n",
