My question was sparked<br/>\nKOS&gt; because I was in what I would call a laborous position - multiple code paths<br/>\nKOS&gt; so multiple test cases. I had 30 test cases for one method, amounting to 300<br/>\nKOS&gt; lines of code. Is this tedious or difficult. In JUnit world, does tedious ==<br/>\nKOS&gt; difficult?<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, it does.  Quick question.  How many lines does that method have?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMichael Feathers<br/>\nwww.objectmentor.com</div>",
