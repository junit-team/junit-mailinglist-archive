Many of the articles there are directed towards the<br/>\nbeginner and will help you greatly as you learn about JUnit. Google is<br/>\nuseful when there&#39;s something you need, but don&#39;t know what it is.<br/>\nJust type a description in, press enter and see how much help it can<br/>\nbe. I&#39;ve found quite a few useful things that way. Another tip with<br/>\nGoogle is to search on the specific error message that you have, often<br/>\nyou&#39;ll find forum discussions about that exact error, with a good<br/>\nchance of a solution being given as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs you learn and start having questions, you will also find the JUnit<br/>\nFAQ very helpful. The questions that it answers really are the<br/>\nfrequent ones that most of us had asked or wondered about and Mike<br/>\nClark does a wonderful job of collating it. Here is a link:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://junit.sourceforge.net/doc/faq/faq.htm\">http://junit.sourceforge.net/doc/faq/faq.htm</a><br/>\n<br/>\nWhen you are ready to start asking more questions on the JUnit mailing<br/>\nlist, please consider following all of the advice in Eric Raymond&#39;s<br/>\nvery helpful document: &quot;How to ask questions the smart way&quot;, available<br/>\nat his website. Here is a link:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html\">http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as books are concerned, I recommend Pragmatic Unit Testing by<br/>\nHunt and Thomas for beginners. JUnit recipes by Rainsberger is good<br/>\nonce you&#39;re past the basics. There are other good books out there, but<br/>\nthese are my recommendations.<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope that this helps.<br/>\n<br/>\nSimon<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On 2/20/06, praveshpappu &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:praveshpappu@...\">praveshpappu@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; i want to know that can i learn junit while i have no knowledge<br/>\n&gt; about junit but i know basic java programming and c programming.<br/>\n&gt; if yes then please give me an idea about junit that how to install, how<br/>\n&gt; to learn and please also tell me how can i built my carrier by using<br/>\n&gt; junit.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nwww.simonpeter.org </span></blockquote></div>",
