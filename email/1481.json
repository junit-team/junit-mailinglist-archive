    "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1783467543\">Jason,<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; However, I believe that (in most cases) the public interface of <br/>\n&gt; any part of<br/>\n&gt; a system should be designed in such a way that when it is tested the<br/>\n&gt; programmer can be assured that he/she hasn&#39;t broken anything.  The<br/>\n&gt; package-scope clients usually have a public interface of their <br/>\n&gt; own which can<br/>\n&gt; then be tested separately from the classes they interact with.  <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This is fair enough in a &quot;write tests first&quot; situation; I agree<br/>\nthat the tests of the public methods should be exhaustive enough<br/>\nthat they exercise any protected or private methods that are <br/>\nutilised by the public methods.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, the situation I described, and a situation for which I<br/>\nthink JUnit is an excellent tool, is one in which someone is <br/>\nrefactoring an existing code-base.  I&#39;ve inherited 15,000+ lines<br/>\nof code, and want the freedom of being able to &quot;smell a code smell&quot;<br/>\nand get right in there and fix it up, irrespective of whether the<br/>\n&quot;smell&quot; occurs in a public, private, or protected method.  However,<br/>\nbefore I change ANYTHING in a system that is in production, and<br/>\nit to all intents and purpose, working, I have to ensure that I<br/>\ndon&#39;t break existing functionality.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf my methodology is to &quot;smell the bad smell, write a Unit Test to<br/>\nconfirm how I believe the protected/private method is working, <br/>\nrefactor the offending code, and then IIABDTTPMIFI&quot; (if it ain&#39;t<br/>\nbroke, don&#39;t tell the project manager I fixed it) is guaranteed<br/>\nby rerunning of the JUnit test.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn this instance, I very much see the need to be able to use JUnit<br/>\nto test protected and private methods.<br/>\n<br/>\nFWIW, I found the JUnitX package at www.extreme-de.com, which<br/>\nserves my needs perfectly, and also plugs in to my favourite<br/>\narchitecture level IDE, Together UML.<br/>\n<br/>\nGlad my occasional thread has prompted so much useful (for me)<br/>\ndiscussion !<br/>\n<br/>\nBest wishes,<br/>\n<br/>\nSteven</div>",
