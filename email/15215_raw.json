You are right that with &quot;keep junit running&quot;\n&gt; option in debug mod=\r\ne &quot;Run&quot; action does not fail, but it\n&gt; does not execute the test either. I&#39;=\r\nve added tracing to the\n&gt; test method and it is just not being called. I st=\r\nill wonder\n&gt; what am I doing wrong here?\n&gt; \n&gt;   I am using Eclipse 3.2M1...=\r\n\n\nI think you&#39;re right.  For me, it works (and runs the code!) when \nrerunn=\r\ning individual test method instances /that were found using \nthe standard T=\r\nestSuite(TestCase) constructor/.  But for dynamically \ngenerated test cases=\r\n, it doesn&#39;t rerun them.  Looks like an Eclipse \nbug to me.\n\n\n\n(For lurkers=\r\n:  The Eclipse &quot;Keep JUnit running after a test run when \ndebugging&quot; option=\r\n is on the run configuration screen.
