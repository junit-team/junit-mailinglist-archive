It was in\n&gt; this message:\n&gt; \n&gt; http://groups.yahoo.com/group/junit/message/11398\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;ll just ask this second time, because it seems like there was a lot\n&gt; of fast posting going on  right them, so maybe it got missed.\n&gt; \n&gt; Any help, pointers, or disagreements would be greatly appreciated.\n\nJust so you know, I didn&#39;t respond because I didn&#39;t follow it. I don&#39;t \ndo a lot of multithreaded programming, so I didn&#39;t feel I could \ncontribute to your question.\n\nAs for patching JUnit, that&#39;s not likely to happen. Is there a generic \nextension you&#39;d like to contribute to the community?\n-- \nJ. B.
