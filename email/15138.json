I am pretty sure that<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;facade is not only case for this.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I have to admit that I can&#39;t make the connection between this<br/>\n&gt; paragraph<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and the subject of this thread.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Let me give an example. Imagine you have a statefull facade under<br/>\n&gt; &gt; test with has 5 methods: first one take no params, second - one param,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; third - two params, etc.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Should we follow your rules and break this facade into 5 classes?<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Should we then write separate unit test class for each of those new<br/>\n&gt; classes?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I still don&#39;t see the connection yet, so let me ask a question: do these<br/>\n&gt; 5 methods (among other things) initialize the same set of fields in the<br/>\n&gt; stateful bean? or completely different fields?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; If the answer is &quot;the same set of fields&quot;, then I&#39;d keep them on the<br/>\n&gt; same stateful bean class. This is the same as having 5 test cases that<br/>\n&gt; use the same fixture objects.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; If the answer is &quot;completely different fields&quot;, then I absolutely would<br/>\n&gt; put them on separate stateful bean classes. I would think that was<br/>\n&gt; obvious. This is the same as having 5 test cases that use completely<br/>\n&gt; different fixture objects (and want them to be fields--that part is<br/>\n&gt; important).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; The way I see it: there should be single test class with several<br/>\n&gt; &gt; parameterized test cases (so several parm generators) and test case<br/>\n&gt; &gt; would test a single test. In order to keep such construction compact you<br/>\n&gt; &gt; can move most of the code into the declarative test definition, like how<br/>\n&gt; &gt; input should look like and what to assert on the output, then test code<br/>\n&gt; &gt; itself could just iterate trough the rules for each given test case<br/>\n&gt; &gt; (before and then after test). Unfortunately this leads to soft-typed<br/>\n&gt; &gt; dynamic bindings and evaluation and as a result practically usable only<br/>\n&gt; &gt; in completely generated tests.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; That surprises me, since I have been using this technique successfully<br/>\n&gt; for five years with completely hand-written tests. I must be missing<br/>\n&gt; something you&#39;re trying to tell me.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; It seems like you really want a single test case per production code<br/>\n&gt; class. I have never wanted that, and I doubt I&#39;ll be able to convince<br/>\n&gt; you about why that&#39;s a bad idea. I suppose you benefit from it in a way<br/>\n&gt; that I don&#39;t. I doubt arguing over it will get us anywhere, so I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; offering you a draw on that topic.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; My point is pretty straightforward: we have these refactoring rules we<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; often follow and we usually say that we should refactor tests like we<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; refactor production code, so why wouldn&#39;t we apply these refactoring<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; rules to tests?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I don&#39;t quite agree with this. Tests should be simple enough to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; require no refactorings at all. Applying OOP patters to the tests may<br/>\n&gt; &gt; lead to fragile test code that will require too much maintenance,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; especially if code under test is being structurally changed.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; This is /very/ interesting.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &quot;Applying OOP patterns to test may lead to fragile test code that will<br/>\n&gt; require too much maintenance.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Shouldn&#39;t we then conclude that<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &quot;Applying OOP patterns to any system may lead to fragile code that will<br/>\n&gt; require too much maintenance&quot;?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Are you saying that refactoring makes systems more fragile?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; (After all, please remember that test code is still just code.)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Why wouldn&#39;t we follow those rules with JUnit test case classes?<br/>\n&gt; The<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; first rule extracts common setup code into setUp() and fixture<br/>\n&gt; &gt; objects.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; The second splits test case classes that have multiple fixtures<br/>\n&gt; into<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; separate test case classes. This leads to test case classes<br/>\n&gt; organized<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; around fixtures.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; As for one test case per model class, that&#39;s a natural place to<br/>\n&gt; start,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; because it&#39;s simple, but once that test case class becomes complex,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; refactor as usual.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; That usually would lead to confusion and will require special tools<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;to track down all the test cases for given class.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I have /never/, /ever/ wanted to track down all the tests for a given<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; class. I /have/ wanted to track down all the tests for a given<br/>\n&gt; /method/,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; which is dirt simple in any decent IDE. (In Eclipse, I hit<br/>\n&gt; Ctrl+Shift+G.)<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Can you then run ALL tests you found in a search view?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Yes. I run all the tests, which includes all the tests I found in that<br/>\n&gt; search view. I run all the tests all the time.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Can these results guarantee that changed method under test didn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; &gt; affected other methods and you don&#39;t have to run all tests for them too?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I suppose not, because I don&#39;t care about that: I run all the tests<br/>\n&gt; anyway.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Let me ask you: how does keeping one test case class per production cod<br/>\n&gt; class &quot;guarantee that changed method under test didn&#39;t affect other<br/>\n&gt; methods without running all the tests for them too&quot;? How do you know the<br/>\n&gt; system-wide impact of a change without running all the tests for the<br/>\n&gt; entire system? (I don&#39;t think the way we organize tests helps us at all<br/>\n&gt; here.)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; You /believe/ this? or it&#39;s your experience? In my /experience/ it<br/>\n&gt; just<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; isn&#39;t that much of an issue.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; It could be not an issue for unit testing of the isolated classes,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; but it is quite different if those classes have more or less complex<br/>\n&gt; &gt; dependencies (e.g. those that may be injected by IoC container in real<br/>\n&gt; &gt; app, but mocked or stubbed in a test time). That perhaps problem with<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the toolset because such testing usually introduces lot of dynamic<br/>\n&gt; &gt; dependencies only resolved or even generated in the runtime.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I notice you didn&#39;t answer my question, even though you wrote this<br/>\n&gt; directly underneath my question. :) I used to have a lot of very<br/>\n&gt; passionate opinions until I started following a simple rule: Don&#39;t claim<br/>\n&gt; X is better than Y until you&#39;ve done both for a while and can measure<br/>\n&gt; the difference.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I use a different rule, which gives quite different results. ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nJames<br/>\n<br/>\nTake care.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; --<br/>\n&gt; J.
