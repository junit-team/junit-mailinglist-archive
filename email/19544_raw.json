Would it handle your current situation?\n&gt;\n&gt; As Cedric pointed out, this only works if a test is a member of only one\n&gt; group.  As so many others do, many of my tests are annotated to be in\n&gt; multiple groups.  For instance, &quot;nightly&quot; and &quot;quick&quot; and &quot;bug&quot; meaning\n&gt; &quot;I want CruiseControl to run this test every night.  Also, this test is\n&gt; quick (and is therefore suitable for our continuous build).  Finally,\n&gt; this test illustrates a bug which is not yet fixed.&quot;\n\nI agree your situation requires multiple groups.  It also seems that\nChristian&#39;s original need can be met with what&#39;s currently in the\ncurrent version of junit + cpsuite, without waiting for this\ndiscussion to complete, so that seems worth pointing out.\n\n&gt; &gt; So, questions for the community:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; 1) Should something like ClasspathSuite be incorporated into JUnit?\n&gt;\n&gt; I believe so.  I certainly need functionality like that and currently\n&gt; have to go to an extension to get it.  Assuming there are many other\n&gt; people in the same boat, why not build it right in?\n\nI myself use cpsuite on enough projects that I&#39;m very tempted to build\nit in.  On the other hand, Johannes has done a great job responding to\nbug reports and feature requests on cpsuite: it&#39;s certainly more\nmature than if we had built it ourselves and maintained it at our\ncurrent pace.  We&#39;ll look at it for 4.5.\n\n&gt; &gt; 2) Should something like JUnitExt&#39;s categories be\n&gt; &gt; incorporated into JUnit?\n&gt;\n&gt; Yes, especially if it allows you to annotate a test case - and\n&gt; preferably even a test method - as being a member of multiple groupings.\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; 3) If yes to the above, what should the API look like?\n&gt;\n&gt; As far as the categories go, I would like to see a simple method-level\n&gt; annotation that looks like this:\n&gt;\n&gt; @TestGroups={&quot;nightly&quot;, &quot;quick&quot;, &quot;bug&quot;}\n\nAny takers on identifying categories with classes?\n\n@TestGroups({Nightly.class, Quick.class, Bug.class})\n\nI&#39;m thinking:\n\n- auto-completion\n- refactoring\n- easy hook for running (just run Nightly.class to get the Nightly build)\n- easy place for further customization (@BeforeClass, @AfterClass, etc)\n\nThanks,\n\n   David Saff\n\n",
