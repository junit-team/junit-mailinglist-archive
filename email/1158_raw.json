Either way because of the exception the test\nmethod is exited at the point of the exception.  So no\nthe rest of the test is not executed.  In cases where\nyou need to do clean up work before exiting you should\nhave a try catch block around the test code and in the\ncatch block rethrow the exception.  You will also need\na finally block to perform your cleanup work.  See an\nearlier posting of mine for some sample code.\n\n--- Joseph Vaughan &lt;jvaughan@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; What is the flow after a fail condition is reached\n&gt; in a test?\n&gt; \n&gt; Does the rest of the test still execute? \n&gt; Is the behavior the same for a failed assert() and\n&gt; an explicit fail()?\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt; joe\n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
