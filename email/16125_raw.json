Here is spring: http://sourceforge.net/projects/springframework.\nI suggest you go to the files section and download one of the files marked\n&quot;with dependencies&quot; so you it includes everything needed to compile and run.\nFor velocity go to http://jakarta.apache.org/velocity/index.html and then\nthe downloads section and so on. They both have ant scripts to run the tests\nso that should get you easily started on where to find the tests etc. Good\nluck.\n\n-T\n\n2006/2/17, Kamal Ahmed &lt;KAhmed@...&gt;:\n&gt;\n&gt; Teemu,\n&gt;\n&gt; Could you please send me the URL, where I can find these test cases for\n&gt; Spring and Velocity\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt; -Kamal.\n&gt;\n&gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; From: junit@yahoogroups.com [mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com] On Behalf Of\n&gt; teemu kanstren\n&gt; Sent: Friday, February 17, 2006 3:54 PM\n&gt; To: junit@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Subject: Re: [junit] which open-source project(s) could be used as example\n&gt; of learning testing ?\n&gt;\n&gt; For research purposes I have gathered data on a bunch of OSS projects and\n&gt; their JUnit tests. I never ran appfuse but I guess I should give it a go\n&gt; if\n&gt; it has good testing. What I did notice is Spring had something around\n&gt; 3000+\n&gt; tests that varied from testing 0 classes to testing 100+ classes so I\n&gt; guess\n&gt; you got a lot of different tests to look at there. Then ant also has 1000+\n&gt; tests and so on. Most I ran had around 500+ and for example velocity I\n&gt; think\n&gt; was around 50 or so. Spring also runs those tests relatively fast and good\n&gt; with little effort needed from someone who doesnt know it (that is not too\n&gt; tricky db setups etc) so I guess its ok. But I think it all depends on you\n&gt; definition of best practices and stuff. I dont think its too simple but I\n&gt; guess it might be im just too complicated myself :o. Also for learning\n&gt; purposes it depends who is doing the learning, in what context and with\n&gt; what\n&gt; background and lots of other stuff. If you can define what you want to see\n&gt; in it maybe it will be easier to suggest something.\n&gt;\n&gt; ps since you all are going to ask what an earth is a test that tests 0\n&gt; classes, well according to the source comments it is an empty test case\n&gt; needed to make eclipse test runner run some tests created using\n&gt; inheritance\n&gt; hierarchies and so on...:)\n&gt;\n&gt; -t\n&gt;\n&gt; 2006/2/15, frank zou &lt;frankz1998@...&gt;:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Hi all,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Lots of open-source projects are using TDD/Unit Testing. Do you have\n&gt; &gt; any ideas of which project(s) could be used to learn the &quot;BEST\n&gt; &gt; PRACTICES&quot; of using Unit Testing ?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; e.g, someone said &quot;AppFuse&quot; is cool for this purpose. Any comments and\n&gt; &gt; / or other projects ?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Thanks,\n&gt; &gt; - Frank\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
