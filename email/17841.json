This does presume that the provider programmer knows more <br/>\n&gt;about the problem domain than the client programmer, but if the provider <br/>\n&gt;doesn&#39;t, then why are they publishing an API for others to use in the <br/>\n&gt;first place?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;None of us are experts in every domain we work in. We need to rely on <br/>\n&gt;the wisdom of others who are experts in those domains, as encapsulated <br/>\n&gt;in the libraries they&#39;ve published, rather than asserting that we always <br/>\n&gt;know what&#39;s best for everything and in every situation. Of course, we <br/>\n&gt;can each be experts in some fields, and those are the fields in which we <br/>\n&gt;publish libraries for the use of other, non-experts. (I have seen <br/>\n&gt;libraries designed by non-experts, and they cause more harm than good.)<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>That does seem patriarchical.  To me, library development is just <br/>\nanother form of development.  Interestingly enough, you mention <br/>\nstatistics in another post.  After I finished school my second project <br/>\nin the workplace was a library for statistical analysis.  I&#39;m not an <br/>\nexpert in statistics by any means, but I worked closely with the initial <br/>\ngroup of users.. they were largely mathematicians and statisticians, a <br/>\nfew were chemists and physicists, and I developed a library that I <br/>\nsuspect may still be used today.   At the time, we were developing it as <br/>\na common library for research and production.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think that one advantage that I had was that I was not an expert.  I <br/>\nsat with people and we went back and forth about the meaning of <br/>\noperations and what interfaces would be useful.  I remember a couple of <br/>\nconcepts that I proposed, purely because they seemed like good object <br/>\nfactoring, that ended up being considered part of the domain.  It was a <br/>\nfun project.<br/>\n<br/>\nMichael Feathers<br/>\nwww.objectmentor.com</div>",
