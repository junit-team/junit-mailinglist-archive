MockObjects are NOT just a way of testing code,\nthey are a tool used to design loosely coupled, well factored systems. \nIf you can easily mock out the whole of an encompassing system in order\nto test one itty-bitty unit, you PROBABLY have done a very good job of\nfollowing the creme-de-la-creme principles of Object Oriented\nProgramming.  I don&#39;t look at them as kludges.\n\nThe real issue may not be the test code.  It may be in the design of the\nproduction code, &quot;may&quot; being the operative word here since I don&#39;t\npresume to pass judgment on your code base.\n\nHTH,\n=jason\n\nOn Mon, 2003-06-16 at 16:48, robert_difalco wrote:\n&gt; Is there a way to get each test method to run in it&#39;s own JVM? I am \n&gt; finding that setUp and tearDown are not enough. I have a lot of code \n&gt; that has to reset static state such as caches each time a test is \n&gt; run, code that is only needed for unit testing. If each test method \n&gt; ran in it&#39;s own JVM, my testing code would not require me to make \n&gt; changes in the code I am testing.\n&gt; \n&gt; It&#39;s not just singletons but also caches that should be initialized \n&gt; once for a JVM. And, honestly, if you think about it, each test \n&gt; method SHOULD be atomic. Mock objects seemed kind of like a kludge \n&gt; for tests not being run atomically.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thoughts?\n&gt; \n&gt; R.\n\n\n",
