We all know how a radio works.  It&#39;s\n&gt; interface\n&gt; &gt; is the same no mat=\r\nter where you go--you have a control to \n&gt; change the \n&gt; &gt; station and a co=\r\nntrol to change the volume.  There are several\n&gt; models\n&gt; &gt; of the radio, a=\r\nnd in a store, there are many instances of each\n&gt; model.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;[...]\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; You can only really do black box testing in this type of\n&gt; environment=\r\n.\n&gt; &gt; You have the advantage of knowing what the component does.  You\n&gt; don=\r\n&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; know how it does it--and from the perspective of using the \n&gt; compon=\r\nent \n&gt; &gt; you don&#39;t care.\n&gt; \n&gt; Yes. But from the perspective of developing t=\r\nhe component, you *do* \n&gt; care. I am sure that radios get white box tested =\r\nat the plant.\n\nThe most important thing is that the component obeys the con=\r\ntracts\nof its interface.  I do use assertions for the internals of the\nclas=\r\ns--something that JUnit cannot do.\n\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; I have created a test harness us=\r\ning JUnit for my components, so\n&gt; that I\n&gt; &gt; can test several component typ=\r\nes with one TestCase.  It&#39;s a\n&gt; beautiful\n&gt; &gt; thing.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Now, If I tri=\r\ned to write a white-box test on my component, I run\n&gt; into\n&gt; &gt; some serious=\r\n setbacks.  That white-box (or micro test) is tied to\n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; component i=\r\nmplementation.  I cannot reuse that test on another \n&gt; &gt; implementation of =\r\nthe same component interface.  That is a serious \n&gt; &gt; drawback to me.\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\nA very serious drawback of not adjusting tests to implementation \n&gt; details=\r\n is that sufficient tests for one implementation are most \n&gt; probably insuf=\r\nficient for another. That doesn&#39;t mean that you can&#39;t \n&gt; reuse them - it&#39;s =\r\njust that it isn&#39;t safe relying on them.\n\nTrue.  However I do not throw awa=\r\ny tests--I add them.  As we find more\nways of breaking the component, we ad=\r\nd that test to the component&#39;s\ntestcase.  That introduces regression testin=\r\ng--and ensures that all\nimplementations of a component don&#39;t break when a n=\r\new regression is\nadded.\n\nTwo truths:\n\n* You can&#39;t know all the design from =\r\nthe beginning.\n* You can&#39;t know all the tests from the beginning.\n\nIt is an=\r\n iterative process.  As things fail, you add a regression test,\nthen you fi=\r\nx the problem.  The order is important--write the test before\nyou fix the p=\r\nroblem.\n\n\n",
