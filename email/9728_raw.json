We do all of this, but I feel like something&#39;s\n&gt; missing:  some sort of validation of the layout.\n\nWhat does &#39;validation of the layout&#39; mean?  I suspect that if you can\nclarify this, you will have answered your question.\n\nThere are probably at least three questions to be dealt with:\n\n1\tIs the data being presented valid?\n2\tIs the PDF (or whatever) representation of the text/graphics\n\tcorrect?\n3\tIs the data being rendered as expected?\n\nThe first and second are traditional unit testing problems.  You do the\nfirst kind of testing, Adobe or whoever presumably has done the second.\n\nPerhaps an example of a failure in the third area would be output where\ndata that should be in tables appears in the body of the text or vice\nversa, or data that should be represented as a pie chart appears as a\nbar graph instead.  So you want to make assertions like\n\n\tassertTrue ( outputIsPieChart(datasetA) );\n\n&gt; Especially for applications whose whole purpose is report generation,\n&gt; I wonder how people are doing this (if at all)?\n\n--\nJim Dixon  jdd@...   tel +44 117 982 0786  mobile +44 797 373 7881\n\n\n",
