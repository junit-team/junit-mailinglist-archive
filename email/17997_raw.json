There is a  \nhigher scripting layer more tailored to testing applications.\n\nOn Sep 21, 2006, at 12:53 PM, Kamal Ahmed wrote:\n\n&gt;\n&gt; I would like to take a look at the framework which you have developed.\n&gt;\n&gt; For the simulation testing, I am looking at\n&gt; http://jemmy.netbeans.org/samples.html\n&gt; &lt;http://jemmy.netbeans.org/samples.html&gt;  to see if it can also be  \n&gt; used for\n&gt; Eclipse UI&#39;s.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; The user tests should be plug-in tests that come as close as  \n&gt; possible to\n&gt;\n&gt; simulating user actions and testing UI appearance, down to simulating\n&gt;\n&gt; mouse clicks (I&#39;ve recently written a framework that makes this much\n&gt;\n&gt; easier, but it&#39;s not clear yet whether it will be released.   \n&gt; Working on\n&gt;\n&gt; such a thing on your own, if you get time and permission, can teach  \n&gt; you\n&gt;\n&gt; a lot about how Eclipse is built).\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n \nYahoo!
