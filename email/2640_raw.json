I\n&gt; don&#39;t think that you can write 200+ pages about JUnit.  The chapter about \n&gt; JUnit is about 20 pages and describes how to write a test case, a suite and\n&gt; execute tests.  Nothing new if you have access to the documentation.\n\nOne certainly could write another 100+ pages about Junit (BTW, there&#39;s\nanother chapter in the book which covers some Junit internals) but IMO\nthe general techniques are more important than the tool itself.\n\n&gt; What is more interesting about this book is the presentation of several \n&gt; testing methods (mock objects for ex.).  I think this book is worth reading\n&gt; but if you don&#39;t want to learn German (...) you will find plenty of other \n&gt; books written in a language you better understand.\n\nThere *may be* an English translation sometime next year but I hope that\nother books about test first and the application of Junit will be\npublished by then. The english speaking XP community is so numerous that\neverything else would be a shame...\n\nJohannes\n\n",
