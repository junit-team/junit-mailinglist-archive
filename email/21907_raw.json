I want to write a small utility to rename the p=\r\nictures in a controllable way, but prefixing something like \n&quot;RND&quot;, a set o=\r\nf random digits, and the original name.  For example, if the original was D=\r\nCIM1001.jpg, I want the class to rename the file to &quot;RND4356332_DCIM1001.jp=\r\ng&quot;.  Windows can then show the photos in a &#39;random&#39; order, but I can still =\r\nfigure out the real photo name, in case someone wants a copy.  Sounds simpl=\r\ne.\n\nI want to build this, using TDD.\nI figure that I need to build tests, a=\r\nnd get green bars in eclipse in the following order:\n-instantiate my photoR=\r\nandomizer class\n-pass it several different paths, and have them be validate=\r\nd (null, empty, non-existing, very long, very short, etc...).\n\nthat was eas=\r\ny.\nbut my next question, is now what?\nIf I was writing this without TDD, my=\r\n next step, would have been to iterate through the directory, and rename al=\r\nl of the files according to my scheme.  I can&#39;t see an operational advantag=\r\ne to exposing any of this to outside, or make it more than one method, for =\r\ntesting purposes.\n\nmaybe what I should do, is have a method that iterates t=\r\nhrough the appropriate directory, generates a random number, and then passe=\r\ns both pieces of information to another method which renames the target fil=\r\ne.  This doesn&#39;t seem like a very good way to do it, but then I would at le=\r\nast be able to test the renaming.\n\nWhat am I missing?\n\n\n",
