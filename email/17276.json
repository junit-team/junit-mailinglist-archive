Best JUnit tester is the senior software developer. But senior  <br/>\nguys hate<br/>\nto write test cases.<br/>\n<br/>\nSenior guys who hate writing tests are not senior guys.  Writing  <br/>\ntests is a matter of professional ethics.  The only way to truly know  <br/>\nthat the code you have written works, and works in the whole system,  <br/>\nis to have, and run, a comprehensive set of tests.  Code coverage for  <br/>\nthese tests should be very close to 100% (i.e. high 90s).  If you  <br/>\ndon&#39;t have this, then you don&#39;t KNOW that your code actually works.   <br/>\nAnd shipping code that you aren&#39;t as certain as possible about is  <br/>\nunprofessional.<br/>\n<br/>\nI wear a green band on my wrist that says &quot;Test First&quot;.  (http:// <br/>\nbutunclebob.com/ArticleS.UncleBob.GreenWristBand)<br/>\nIt is a symbol of my commitment to produce the best code I can, and  <br/>\nto be sure that it works to the best of my ability.  It reminds me to  <br/>\nwrite tests, to write them first, and to write them diligently.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe argument about &quot;TIME&quot; is laughable.  It is like saying that we  <br/>\ndon&#39;t have time to test, but we DO have time to debug.  That&#39;s an  <br/>\nunprofessional attitude.  Time spent writing tests is time that will  <br/>\nprevent us from having to debug.  Time spent writing tests is time  <br/>\nspent designing, is time spent thinking, and is time spent making  <br/>\nsure that our code can be checked again, and again, and again.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyone who says that they don&#39;t have time to write tests should not  <br/>\nbe writing code.<br/>\n                 |<br/>\n<br/>\n----<br/>\nRobert C.
