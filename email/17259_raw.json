However, \nthat&#39;s a bit of a non-starter for a single codebase component as our QA \nrun uses the TextUI TestRunner and our developers tend to use Eclipse&#39;s \nRemoteTestRunner - I&#39;d be up against some pretty stiff competition.\n\nAs TestSuite#isTestMethod is private I&#39;m unable to modify the naming \nconvention that JUnit searches for, so I&#39;ve plumped for extending \nTestSuite#runTest(Test,TestResult). If I refactor to an improved \nsolution, I&#39;ll post my findings!\n\nThanks,\n\nSteve.\n\n--\nStephen Smith, MEng (Wales).\nhttp://www.stephen-smith.co.uk/\n\nKent Beck wrote:\n&gt; Steve,\n&gt;  \n&gt; To run just certain tests, you could write your own test runner. As\n&gt; mentioned in the JUnit Pocket Guide, writing runners is a surprising rare\n&gt; but useful technique. A simple way to do this is to pass your own TestResult\n&gt; as a parameter to you test suite:\n&gt;  \n&gt; ...Test suite= ...\n&gt; TestResult result= new TestResult() {\n&gt;   protected void run(final TestCase test) {\n&gt;     // do whatever you want to do here\n&gt;   }\n&gt; };\n&gt; suite.run(result);\n&gt; return result;\n&gt;  \n&gt; I hope this helps.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Cheers,\n&gt;  \n&gt; Kent Beck\n&gt; Three Rivers Institute\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   _____  \n&gt; \n&gt; From: junit@yahoogroups.com [mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com] On Behalf Of\n&gt; Stephen Smith\n&gt; Sent: Monday, July 31, 2006 10:32 AM\n&gt; To: junit@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Subject: Re: [junit] Re: Filtering by method in JUnit 3.8-style tests\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Setting aside JUnit 4.x temporarily, is there any way using the JUnit \n&gt; 3.8.x API I can filter out particular test methods based upon a set of \n&gt; criteria, without resorting to implementing a suite() method on each \n&gt; individual TestCase?\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt; \n&gt; Steve.\n&gt; --\n&gt; Stephen Smith, MEng (Wales).\n&gt; http://www.stephen- &lt;http://www.stephen-smith.co.uk/&gt; smith.co.uk/\n&gt; \n&gt; Michael Schechter wrote:\n&gt;&gt; That&#39;s odd - it works just fine for me. However, trying to filter on\n&gt;&gt; more than one method doesn&#39;t seem to be intuitively obvious, and\n&gt;&gt; nothing really seems to work.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; The code I use to get one test to run is as follows (it&#39;s from the\n&gt;&gt; test class&#39;s main() method):\n&gt;&gt; JUnitCore core = new JUnitCore();\n&gt;&gt; Request testRequest = Request.method(aTestClass, someArguments[0]);\n&gt;&gt; core.run(testRequest);\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I have no idea how to extend this model to being able to specify\n&gt;&gt; multiple methods, however.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; In addition, I really hope that someone starts documenting all of the\n&gt;&gt; nifty new features in JUnit 4.x - the current level is somewhat\n&gt;&gt; (frustratingly) incomplete. The basic features have been covered by a\n&gt;&gt; number of writers - the more complex, such as this issue, still seem\n&gt;&gt; to be missing.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I think JUnit has the potential to become even more popular with a\n&gt;&gt; clearer examination of the framework on which it is built. There seems\n&gt;&gt; to be a great deal of power and flexibility available - it&#39;s just\n&gt;&gt; really unclear as to how to get at it.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Thanks in advance!\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Michael Schechter\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; --- In junit@yahoogroups. &lt;mailto:junit%40yahoogroups.com&gt; com, David Saff\n&gt; &lt;saff@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Shannon,\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; You are right--this doesn&#39;t currently work in JUnit 4.1.

I create and run the test like this:\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Request r = Request.method(OldStyleTestCase.class, &quot;testSomeMethod&quot;);\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; jcore.run(r);\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The outcome is that all test methods are run, not just the one test\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; method I specified. I also tried using a custom filter, but the filter\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; never gets called because the runner for this class is\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; org.junit.internal.runners.OldTestClassRunner which does not implement\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Filter.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Do I need to write my own runner to get this to work?
