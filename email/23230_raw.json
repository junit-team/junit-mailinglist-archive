Thank you for the good work.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; I was wondering, what made you choose TestRule to be an abstract class\n&gt;&gt; and not an interface? This is so much of a pain.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; JUnit4 provides a number of base classes for Rule implementations already\n&gt; (Verifier, ExternalResoruces, etc). Anyone wanting to reuse that behavior\n&gt; already had to lose the inheritance slot.\n&gt;\n\nThat&#39;s true. And I do prefer &#39;cannot inherit sometimes&#39; than &#39;cannot inherit\never&#39;.\n\n\n&gt;  In your position, I&#39;d also be frustrated.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; The class being empty, I don&#39;t get it.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; The idea was to guide people away from an improper usage of Rules.\n&gt;&gt; For example, calling Timeout.apply in the middle of a test method is\n&gt;&gt; so likely to be the wrong thing to do, that we wanted to make it\n&gt;&gt; difficult.  If there were some way for a rule to expose one interface\n&gt;&gt; to the framework, and another to test writers, that would be ideal.\n&gt;&gt; This seemed like the next-best solution.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\nSeems logical to me. Didn&#39;t realize that the benefit was hidden in the\n&#39;protected&#39; keyword :-)\nWe could check at runtime that the method is being called properly but that\nwould be less elegant and could be tricky.\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; One of my custom Rules needs to extend a class already.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; I would also be interested in understanding the use case.\n&gt;\n&gt; Since there is only one method in TestRule, it&#39;s very easy to use\n&gt; delegation instead of inheritance to reuse the code in your base class.\n&gt;\n\nThe class I inherit from has dozens of methods. That&#39;s not the best use case\nof delegation. However, I ended up doing exactly that.\n\nOverall when I design code, I prefer interfaces over inheritance, but I\n&gt; believe we should optimize for developers that use Rules over developers\n&gt; that create new Rule implementations; it&#39;s by far the most common case. A\n&gt; large number of Java developers use IDEs, and having the IDE suggest a\n&gt; completion that a test should never call is a poor and confusing experience.\n&gt;\n\nAgree 100%.\n\nThanks for the insights,\n\nDavid.\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n",
