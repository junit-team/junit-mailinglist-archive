In the git branch, Rule is an <br/>\n&gt;&gt; annotation and ClassRule an interface so I don&#39;t understand what you <br/>\n&gt;&gt; mean by asymmetry.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; What should be MethodRule?<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Changing existing rules is inevitable, since MethodRule#apply operates <br/>\n&gt;&gt; in the context of a FrameworkMethod and an instantiated target object, <br/>\n&gt;&gt; neither of which are available at class scope.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Also, I&#39;m not happy about encouraging more extra-test state as this reduces the chances that tests are independent.
