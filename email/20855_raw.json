One of the ideas is\nto find a general way to run suites faster by running tests in parallel. To\nfind effective parallelization strategies, we need data on test run times.\nRather than build big infrastructure to do this (which would undoubtedly be\ncool), I&#39;d like to start with the simplest thing that could possibly work.\nSo:\n\nIf you have a long-running test suite and\nYou run it using Ant and\nYou can use the XML formattter (&quot;&lt;formatter type=&quot;xml&quot;/&gt;&quot;) and\nYou don&#39;t mind sharing your test names with me confidentially\n\nWould you please zip your reports and email them to me. If they&#39;re too big\nfor email, please let me know and we&#39;ll figure out a backup plan. I&#39;d\nappreciate any context you can provide--how long the suite has been in\ndevelopment, the experience level of the developers, whatever else you think\nwe might need to know.\n\nThe first data set I looked at was from DevCreek--&gt;90M test runs from\nproduction coding representing more than 50 person-years of development. To\nmy surprise, the test runs exhibit a power law distribution (way lots of\nfast tests, a few very long running tests, plot a histogram log-log and you\nget a straight line). I have no idea what this means, but it brings to mind\nthe Asimov quote, &quot;The most exciting phrase to hear in science, the one that\nheralds new discoveries, is not &#39;Eureka!&#39; (I found it!) but &#39;That&#39;s funny\n...&#39;&quot; I&#39;ve found many power law distributions in the static and dynamic\nstructure of code, but the mechanisms influencing test run times seem to be\ncompletely different than those influencing code structure.\n\nAnyway, I&#39;d love to validate those findings. The Ant XML format seems like a\ngood place to start. Alternatively, you could send me one or more files with\ntest run times one per line.\n\nQuestions and comments appreciated.\n\nYours in science,\n\nKent Beck\nThree Rivers Institute\n\n\n",
