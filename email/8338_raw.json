I try very hard to not actually write to\nthe database, and leave that for automated integration tests*.  My unit\ntests use some kind of mock framework to simply verify that the code\nthat *I* wrote made the calls to the framework that I expected it to\nmake.  Then I depend on the framework to do the right thing in the\n&#39;real&#39; case.\n\nYou&#39;ll get problems if you misunderstand how to use the framework, but\nthat&#39;s something best caught in integration tests, especially when\nyou&#39;re talking about having to restart JVMs.  \n\nKevin\n\n*Currently our &#39;integration tests&#39; are achieved through monkey-based\nautomation.  That is, our smart QA people must behave like trained\nmonkeys and execute scripts for our applications &quot;automatically&quot; when\nwe have a new build.  I recommend avoiding this route in favor of\nautomation tools or real monkeys.  We&#39;re evaluating the former\ncurrently, although I&#39;m advocating the latter.  If you can&#39;t have fun\nat work, why work?  Philistines.\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
