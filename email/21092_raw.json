Can=\r\n anyone directly me to a primer that will help? \n\nI would also be intereste=\r\nd in any servlet based runners that have been \ndeveloped (couldn&#39;t find tho=\r\nse either). I know that Junit \nis &quot;extendable&quot;, but I don&#39;t see any clear d=\r\nocumentation of what \nclasses to extend, and how to link them together (and=\r\n I don&#39;t really \nhave time to walk through all the Junit source).\n\n** btw, =\r\nNo, I&#39;m not trying to test servlets - there are lots of tools \nfor that, JU=\r\nnitEE is the only Servlet runner I&#39;ve ever seen and I want \nto run my test =\r\nwithin a full J2EE container (no mocks). Unfortunately \nno-one has updated =\r\nthat project for 4.x.\n\nTIA\n\n\n",
