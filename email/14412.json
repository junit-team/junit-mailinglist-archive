    "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-849165356\">Jason and Andrew,<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you for your perspective that JUnit should include a graphical test<br/>\nrunner. I understand you to be saying that you don&#39;t use IDEs, at least not<br/>\nall the time, and you would like a friendlier presentation of test results<br/>\nthan what is available from the textual test runner.<br/>\n<br/>\nOur thinking about the role of graphical runners in the base JUnit release<br/>\nevolved in a couple of steps. First, we noticed that JUnit depended on AWT<br/>\nand Swing classes even though those classes didn&#39;t seem central to the<br/>\nframework. This is an aesthetic point, but aesthetics often lead us in the<br/>\nright direction so we trust them. Breaking this dependency required breaking<br/>\nJUnit into two parts, core and UI. Once we had broken JUnit up we came to<br/>\nthe second step of deciding who should be responsible for the UI. Ant and<br/>\nthe IDEs already have their own user interface and represent the (vast?)<br/>\nmajority of JUnit usage, so there is little value added by maintaining<br/>\nseparate UIs. With our limited time to support JUnit, it didn&#39;t make sense<br/>\nto continue maintaining the graphical runners ourselves.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe aren&#39;t against standalone runners in general. One of our goals with JUnit<br/>\n4 is to make writing runners easier. However, we seldom have code in the<br/>\nJUnit distribution that we didn&#39;t write and there is a widely established<br/>\ncommunity of JUnit extenders. Because of this we are comfortable letting go<br/>\nof the graphical runners and encouraging people to write and publish their<br/>\nown. If there is anything more we can do to aid in this endeavor, please let<br/>\nus know.<br/>\n<br/>\nSincerely yours,<br/>\n<br/>\nKent Beck<br/>\nThree Rivers Institute<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a>] On <br/>\n&gt; Behalf Of Jason Rogers<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Monday, August 22, 2005 7:05 AM<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: RE: [junit] Some questions about JUnit 4<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; On Mon, 2005-08-22 at 09:50 +0100, Clarke, Andrew wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Was I the only person to be saddened by this announcement?  <br/>\n&gt; Maybe I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; &gt; just being sentimental here but the Graphical TestRunner&#39;s green<br/>\n&gt; &gt; bar/red<br/>\n&gt; &gt; bar was one of the earliest delights of Junit.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Besides, as a casual user of Java I have yet to find the energy to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; learn<br/>\n&gt; &gt; an IDE.  When I do have to code Java I generally use my normal text<br/>\n&gt; &gt; editor and the graphical test runner, which I find is quicker and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; easier<br/>\n&gt; &gt; to use than the text version.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; I know Kent has an evangelising streak - automated unit testing,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; xp/agile, etc - which he has used well in the service of <br/>\n&gt; the software<br/>\n&gt; &gt; community but I think insisting on the use of an IDE is a <br/>\n&gt; crusade too<br/>\n&gt; &gt; far.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I was disappointed by this news as well.  I do use an IDE for most of<br/>\n&gt; the day, but when I have to work remotely I use &#39;vi&#39; over SSH <br/>\n&gt; and a GUI<br/>\n&gt; TestRunner on my local machine.  So personally, I would like <br/>\n&gt; to have at<br/>\n&gt; least one graphical TestRunner. (Yes, I know that I could set up many<br/>\n&gt; IDEs to do the same thing -- Eclipse for instance -- but that chews up<br/>\n&gt; too many resources on my laptop.)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Kent, perhaps you would consider adding a community section to CVS and<br/>\n&gt; allow us to add code there.  You can document this portion of the<br/>\n&gt; repository as being &quot;unwarranted&quot; (whatever that would mean). <br/>\n&gt;  It would<br/>\n&gt; allow for the community to add their $0.02.  I don&#39;t think <br/>\n&gt; anyone wants<br/>\n&gt; to make more work for you or Erich, but it would be nice to <br/>\n&gt; have an easy<br/>\n&gt; way for everyone to use JUnit in a way that is comfortable to them.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -- <br/>\n&gt; Jason Rogers<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ<br/>\n&gt; liveth in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the<br/>\n&gt; faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me.<br/>\n&gt; (Galatians 2:20)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------ Yahoo!
