We run a nightlybuild regression, so the next morning I<br/>\ncan see if I missed anything (sometimes the failures are well<br/>\nremoved from the actual class that was changed).<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, we would like to be able to record historical data of the<br/>\nfluctuations.  In the past, manually, we have found that the<br/>\nerrors/failures go up when we get above a certain velocity.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for any insight that can be provided.<br/>\n<br/>\nDianne Doss<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nDear Doss,<br/>\n<br/>\n              If you are generating JUnit Report through Ant, definitely you<br/>\nshould write one build.xml file. Before generating new report, why not you<br/>\ntake copy of the previous report.  In Ant API  contains copy tag and move<br/>\ntag. So<br/>\nfirst step you take a back up using Copy/ Move tag.<br/>\nSecond step you clear your old report using delete tag.<br/>\nThird step create report folder again.<br/>\nFinally you generate new report.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPaul Domnic J.<br/>\n<br/>\nScandent Group<br/>\n4th Floor, KRM Centre,<br/>\nNo.2, Harrington Road,<br/>\nChetpet,<br/>\nChennai 600 031<br/>\nIndia<br/>\n<br/>\nTel:+91 44  5211 8090<br/>\nFax:+91 44  5211 8068<br/>\nImportant Email Information :- The  information  in  this  email is<br/>\nconfidential and may  be  legally  privileged.
