I have some common setup and\nteardown tasks that are shared amongst several test classes. For example I\nread test data from an xml file used by each test class that contains global\ninformation like Locale and Timezone. Another is removing test data from the\ndb. These are not tasks I want to do once per test class but once per test\nmethod in several test classes. I would think it makes more sense to pull\nout these common tasks from each test class and either put them in a\nutility/helper class or create a base test class that each test class will\ninherit. The dilemma I have is which approach is better. Creating a utility\nclass or creating a base test class that is inherited. The common tasks are\nnot package specific, meaning they are not targeting a specific suite of\ntest classes so my initial thought is to create a utility class for these\ncommon tasks to reside. This may seem to be more of a general java design\nquestion but was hoping someone can give me some pointers.\n \nThanks,\nScott\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n",
