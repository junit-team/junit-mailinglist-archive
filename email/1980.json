JUnit is actually very good for<br/>\nsome types of ATs because it is such a well designed automated testing<br/>\nframework.  They aren&#39;t violating any premises, for as Matthew said they are<br/>\nusing it for UTs in the way it was meant.  But, if it happens to work for<br/>\ntheir ATs, why not use it?<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you would still like to get into the debate of what is a &quot;UNIT&quot; though,<br/>\nfeel free.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Jason</div>",
