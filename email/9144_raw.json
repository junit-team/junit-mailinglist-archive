Use JUnitX if you need access to \nprivate parts. Refactoring without tests is like walking a tightrope \nwithout a net. You can do it, but I wouldn&#39;t.\n\n&gt; Given a class Foo for which I want to create a mock object:\n&gt; \n&gt; public class Foo {\n&gt;       public void doSomething() {\n&gt;             ...\n&gt;       }\n&gt; }\n&gt; \n&gt; What is the better approach? To define an interface that only the\n&gt; mock object and the original object implement or to subclass Foo?\n\nMy advice: Extract the narrowest interface that could possibly work and \nimplement it.\n\n&gt; I don&#39;t see a reason to to use an interface if it is only going to be\n&gt; implemented once (not counting the mock object, I can achieve the\n&gt; same overriding methods). Am I missing something? Or is it &quot;good\n&gt; design&quot; to specify the contract of a class with an interface even if\n&gt; there is not going to be more than one implementation ever?\n\nFirst, you don&#39;t know how many implementations there will ever be. Even \nif you really think you know, you don&#39;t. That&#39;s nothing bad about you -- \nno-one knows.\n\nNext, I am experimenting with the following Java implementation pattern. \nA refactoring, I think.\n\n    * Replace private/public separation with interface/implementation \nseparation.\n\nIn other words, rather than make methods private, which can hurt \ntesting, extract a client interface and ship it to the client. Hide \ncreating instances behind factories. In other words, do like JDBC, JMS, \nEJB...\n\nI like it. Thoughts?\n-- \nJ. B.
