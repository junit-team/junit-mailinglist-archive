It isn&#39;t part of JUnit itself.\n\nJtf\n\nOn 12/29/06, junitheadache &lt;bohs01@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Hi Bob,\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Actually, I&#39;ve already done the &quot;by hand&quot; part, where by i used a\n&gt; template of sorts to fill in information i needed, and used\n&gt; Equivalence partitioning and boundary analysis to pick suitable\n&gt; values.\n&gt;\n&gt; I was actually considering writing from scratch the production codes\n&gt; to read in the template and generate teh code, however my final goal\n&gt; was to integrate it with JUnit and I thought it would be easier if I\n&gt; could just build ontop of JUnit&#39;s existing source code for\n&gt; generating the test class template it currently has.\n&gt;\n&gt; The problem now is, I cant seem to find the code of JUnit that\n&gt; generates the test class template... this is the part where i badly\n&gt; need help. I&#39;ve dled the JUnit 3.8.1 source code and look through\n&gt; them, but either I am missing it or its not there.\n&gt;\n&gt; It might be in the Junit runtime class files, however the source\n&gt; codes for those are unavailable on sourceforge?\n&gt;\n&gt; Need Help,\n&gt; Jimm\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In junit@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Bob Runstein&quot; &lt;rrunstein@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; On 12/27/06, junitheadache\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;bohs01@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Hi all,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I am currently working on auto generation of test\n&gt; &gt; &gt; cases for TDD for\n&gt; &gt; &gt; my honors year project. And was considering\n&gt; &gt; &gt; modifying JUnit such\n&gt; &gt; &gt; that it will auto generate some test cases based\n&gt; &gt; &gt; values flagged by\n&gt; &gt; &gt; users.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; How about considering a project where you generate the unit tests\n&gt; by\n&gt; &gt; hand and then auto generate the production code from them? Now\n&gt; that\n&gt; &gt; would be something!\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Bob\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n-- \n\nhttp://www.developertesting.com/\n\n",
