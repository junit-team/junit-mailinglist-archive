There were a few\nclasses in the repository, so the first task I set for\nmyself was adding unit tests for them, as none\nexisted.  As I started trying to craft tests for what\nI thought the classes were doing, it led to me moving\nthe old classes into another (backup) package, and\nrewriting new tests and classes in the regular\npackage.  While writing the tests I saw things I\ndidn&#39;t like, classes that were doing too much or too\nlittle, etc.  In the end, I had a better understanding\nof what the old classes were supposed to do, and the\nnew classes worked much better than the old ones from\nthe spike.  \n\nNow, I will admit, at that time I was only dealing\nwith about 8-10 classes, so going that route wasn&#39;t as\npainful as it could be with ten times that number. \nWith a huge number of classes, I might take a slightly\ndifferent approach.  For example, taking the classes\ninvolved in the greatest number of customer complaints\n(bug reports, whatever) OR the classes dealing with\nsomething the customer wanted changed, and writing\ntests for those and changing the classes as needed.\n\n-Eric\n\n--- Alan Bram &lt;alan@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; In this discussion, apparently we have been talking\n&gt; about &quot;retrofitting&quot; unit tests for old code that\n&gt; never before had them. The notion seems to be that\n&gt; each method in a class, or perhaps each public\n&gt; method, should have a unit test.\n&gt; \n&gt; I think this is wrong. I think, as J.B. said, that\n&gt; in such a case you should concentrate on testing\n&gt; features, not simply methods.\n&gt; \n&gt; I would say that for new code, where you&#39;re writing\n&gt; tests along with your production code, it might make\n&gt; sense to try for a test per (public) method. But\n&gt; that&#39;s because in this case you have the benefit of\n&gt; thinking about the testing at the time you&#39;re\n&gt; writing the code. I think you&#39;re more likely to\n&gt; design your code in such a way as to have this make\n&gt; more sense. (The &quot;testing influences design&quot;\n&gt; notion.)\n&gt; \n&gt; The problem I see with mindlessly (or even\n&gt; mindfully) writing a test for each method, just to\n&gt; satisfy someone&#39;s idea that code coverage is good,\n&gt; is that you&#39;re likely to (1) invest a lot of (or\n&gt; even a little) time; and (2) generate a lot of test\n&gt; code (which will have to be maintained, don&#39;t\n&gt; forget), for what will turn out to be little or no\n&gt; benefit. I would bet that the marginal number of\n&gt; bugs found by &quot;complete&quot; per-method tests over a\n&gt; more sensible per-feature approach, both now and\n&gt; forever in the future, is very close to zero. At\n&gt; least that&#39;s my impression based on my own\n&gt; experiences.\n&gt; \n&gt; More is not always better.\n&gt; \n&gt; I would be very curious to know if anyone can report\n&gt; on actual (measured, quantitative) experiences that\n&gt; either support or refute this.\n&gt; \n&gt;  - Alan Bram\n&gt;    alan@...\n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
