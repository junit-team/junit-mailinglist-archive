[...] I\nwant to display some\n&gt; information at Type column in JUnitReport. But it\nseems that only the\n&gt; Assert Fail/Error information can be displayed. I\nwant to display some\n&gt; Assert Sucessful information which I need in order\nto make the report\n&gt; more detailed.\n\nI understood what you wanted to do but, due to the way\nJUnit works,\nit&#39;s not possible without some heavy lifting. The\nbasic issue is that\nthere&#39;s no &quot;event&quot; created for a successful assertion.\nOnly exceptions\nthrown by the code under test or the test method\nitself create a\n&quot;failure&quot; event.\n\nTo put it another way, there&#39;s no way for JUnit to\ntell whether you\nexecuted one, two or a dozen assertions somewhere\ninside your test\nmethod. That is, unless you instrument the bytecode\nsomehow (with\nwhich I cannot help since it&#39;s really not my field of\nexpertise) and\nadd the necessary logging to where the assertion\nmethods are invoked.\n\nOn 10/31/06, Bo Liu &lt;hitliubo@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; A guy said I could achieve my goal though modifying\nXSL.\n&gt; But I&#39;ve no idea about that.\n\nMe neither.
