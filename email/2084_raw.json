Sorry about that.\n\nNo, and that is by design. One of the key requirements of unit testing is \n&quot;Report for each test only &#39;pass&#39; or &#39;fail&#39;.&quot; Five assertions failures is no \nmore broken than one. It supports a specific technique and changing it would \nbe a Bad Thing, in the authors&#39; eyes. I agree with them.\n\nCan you factor into multiple tests? Why do you care about the number of \nfailed assertions in a test?\n\nYou may not appreciate the question. (&quot;I *did* think about this, you know!&quot;) \nAnswer it, anyway. You may be surprised what we can tell you.\n\nJBR.\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nGet your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com/intl.asp\n\n\n",
