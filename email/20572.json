    "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1324339283\">To figure out what was happening, I wrote a few tests, set some<br/>\nbreakpoints and saw what was going on.  However, what I saw seems to<br/>\ndisagree with the other observations in this thread.  This is what I<br/>\nexecuted: <br/>\npublic class DoubleTest extends TestCase {<br/>\n    public void testDouble () {<br/>\n        assertEquals( 12.3d, 12.4d );<br/>\n    }<br/>\n}<br/>\nI set break points in the various methods of Assert and confirmed that<br/>\n assertEquals( Object, Object ) was invoked with two Double<br/>\nparameters. Now Object.equals would always fail because these<br/>\nparameters are not at the same address in memory.  According to the<br/>\ndocumentation for 1.5 the Double.equals method creates long&#39;s from the<br/>\nIEEE specified bits for the double value and compares their values for<br/>\nequality.  This was in fact the behavior I saw during my tests.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis may not help explain the other behavior Nattapong saw, but at<br/>\nleast the behavior I saw conforms to the Principle of least astonishment.<br/>\n<br/>\nDavid Putnam<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;nat_tul&quot; &lt;natta@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Roger Glover&quot; &lt;glover_roger@&gt; <br/>\n&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;J.

However,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the outcome surprise me. Assertion success but<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; obj1.equals(obj2) return false.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; What&#39;s going on inside assertEquals() operation? Is this<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; what it&#39;s suppose to be?<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As I stated, albeit not very clearly the first time (Curse you<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Rich Text Editor(Beta)&quot;!), I suspect that the culprit here is<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that &quot;Assert.assertEquals(Object, Object)&quot; is not being called<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; at all. This is borne out by the fact that a J2SE 1.4 compiler<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and a JavaSE 1.5 compiler treat the same call completely<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; differently.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I *SUSPECT* that the 1.5 compiler is unboxing the Double<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; objects into primitive longs and that the method that is<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; *ACTUALLY* called is &quot;Assert.assertEquals(long,long)&quot;. This<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; accounts for the behavior since the integer parts of your two<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; numbers are the same. &quot;Assert.assertEquals(long,long)&quot; yields<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; successful after the Doubles are converted (truncated) to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; longs.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; That&#39;s almost certainly what is happening, and good deduction.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Thank you very much!<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Now we ask the question, what&#39;s the better answer? Defeat the  <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; purpose of assertEquals(Object,Object) or letting programmers  <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; hoist themselves on their own petards?<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; JUnit could detect this situation, but if it did, I&#39;d prefer  <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; it to warn the programmer rather than fix the problem, because  <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I want to encourage programmers to improve their design:  <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; either the test should compare the Double values with a  <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; tolerance, or perhaps the production code ought not to use<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Doubles.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Well if that is the best solution (and I must say that I like it<br/>\n&gt; &gt; better than the status quo) then the easiest way to do that would<br/>\n&gt; &gt; probably be to create a bogus &quot;Assert.assertEquals(double,double)&quot; <br/>\n&gt; that:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; A) is deprecated (Yes, I mean it. A new method that is deprecated and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; with no intent ever to remove it). The javadoc should point to the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 3-double overload as the preferred alternative and explain why.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; *AND*<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; B) is implemented to unconditionally throw<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &quot;UnsupportedOperationException&quot; (or similar unchecked standard<br/>\n&gt; &gt; exception) with a message that indicates that you should use the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 3-double overload instead.<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m agree with this choice. Since it&#39;s not preferred to be used with <br/>\n&gt; Double so some Exception should be threw.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; -- Roger Glover<br/>\n&gt; &gt;    Object Partners, Inc.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Nattapong Sirilappanich<br/>\n&gt; Engineer, National Language Development - GCoC & TSC Thailand<br/>\n&gt; Software Group, IBM Thailand Co., Ltd.<br/>\n&gt; e-mail: natta@...<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>",
