Where I have seen it fail miserably and repeatedly is when \n&quot;external&quot; testers (converted programmers) try to write object-level \ntests for code they&#39;re not permitted to or don&#39;t know how to change.\n\nYou&#39;re the first person to tell me they had this working, so I&#39;d never \nthought it possible before. I&#39;m glad to hear it&#39;s working for you, and \nI&#39;ll keep it in mind the next time this discussion rolls around.\n\nTake care.\n-- \nJ. B.
