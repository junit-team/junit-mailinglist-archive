I connect to a data provider via an IP address. They have\n&gt; provided an API which I implement, and get callbacks from them with\n&gt; the data. I can create a mock of one of their classes - but since\n&gt; it&#39;s not hooked up to their IP, there&#39;s no data in it.\n&gt; \n&gt; I suppose I could decompile their class and put some data in it - but\n&gt; at that point, am I really testing my interaction with their classes -\n&gt; or with one of my own munging?\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks for any suggestions.\n\nIf you have access to /good/ documentation that /clearly/ describes the \nbehavior behind their API, then you can try simulating it and see how it \ngoes.\n\nAn alternative is to write simple Learning Tests against their (live) \nAPI, then use that information to program your mocks.\n\nIt might be worth mocking one level further up, abstraction-wise. Then \nyou can test-drive an implementation of your own API that hides all the \ncomplicated callback stuff, that connects to a live one of whatever they \nhave, but not have to test your business logic against their \ninfrastructure component. Without more specific information, I can&#39;t \nmake a clearer suggestion. :)\n\nGood luck.\n-- \nJ. B.
