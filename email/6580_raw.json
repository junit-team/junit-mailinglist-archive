So far I have used Ant\n&gt; &gt;to write test-scipts (based on the command line interface for my \n&gt; &gt;application). Of course, these test are not really unit tests, but \n&gt; &gt;application tests. Nevertheless, they are very useful.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;My question is therefore, does anybody have any ideas about \n&gt; &gt;converting already existing Ant based tests to JUnit?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Basically, I am using some Ant functionality to copy directories \n&gt; &gt;files, call javac, and define some properties. I wouldn&#39;t like to \n&gt; &gt;rewrite all the scripts in Java, but calling Ant from JUnit turns \nout \n&gt; &gt;to be a bit ackward as well. Are there any other tools I might \nwant \n&gt; &gt;to use?\n&gt; \n&gt; Well, JUnit tests are written in Java, but you don&#39;t want to rewrite\n&gt; your tests in Java, so why do you want to use JUnit? I would say,\n&gt; &quot;Don&#39;t bother.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; What pain do you feel by not having these tests written in Java?\n&gt; \n\nI don&#39;t care if they are not written in Java, but I thought it would \nbe nicer to have all tests under a single test system. So I also \nlooked at calling ANT from JUnit, but didn&#39;t find an easy way to do \nthat.\n\n\n\n",
