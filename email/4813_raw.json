Rainsberger&quot;\n&lt;jbr@...&gt; writes:\n&gt; Quoting Vladimir Bossicard &lt;vladimir@...&gt;:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I dont think it can replace your print statements\n&gt; &gt; &gt; because when you are printing, you are &lt;b&gt; discovering\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;/b&gt; rather than &lt;b&gt; verifying &lt;/b&gt;.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; but once you have discovered, you can verify that the class acts \n&gt; the \n&gt; &gt; same way over and over again.  If you keep your print statements, \n&gt; you&#39;re\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; discovering each time your run you tests, which is a lost of \n&gt; time.\n&gt; \n&gt; What&#39;s more, you may not need your print statements to discover. \n&gt; Here is a \n&gt; common trick I use.\n&gt; \n&gt; Suppose I want to debug something by checking a value. I write the \n&gt; smallest \n&gt; test case possible to get to that point. If possible, I write this \n&gt; assertion:\n&gt; \n&gt; assertEquals( &quot;&quot;, objectInUse.getValueToCheck())\n&gt; \n&gt; This will fail and tell me what &#39;valueToCheck&#39; is, instead. Now I \n&gt; verify by \n&gt; hand and use that as the new expected value.\n&gt; \n&gt; assertEquals( &quot;myNewExpectedValue&quot;, objectInUse.getValueToCheck())\n&gt; \n&gt; If the value to check is buried somewhere, then I need access to it. \n&gt; A \n&gt; collecting parameter will help, at least until I refactor the object \n&gt; under test \n&gt; to be easier to test on its own. With the collecting parameter, I \n&gt; can grab the \n&gt; value at the right moment and assert its value afterwards.\n&gt; \n&gt; ValueCollector valueCollector = new ValueCollector();\n&gt; ObjectInUse objectInUse = new \n&gt; ObjectInUse(otherConstructorParameters, \n&gt; valueCollector);\n&gt; // stimulate objectInUse\n&gt; assertEquals( &quot;myExpectedValue&quot;, \n&gt; valueCollector.getValue().toString());\n&gt; \n&gt; Of course, if I&#39;m forcing myself to do a good job, I work harder at \n&gt; writing the \n&gt; smallest possible test. I learn as much as I can about the objects \n&gt; that \n&gt; ObjectInUse collaborates with. I refactor ObjectInUse to make it \n&gt; easier to fake \n&gt; out its collaborators. Now I can write a really small, fast test.\n&gt; \n&gt; etimes, I just put \n&gt; junit.framework.Assert.fail(objectToCheck.toString()) in \n&gt; my production code. It&#39;s better than printing a value, because I \n&gt; have the exact \n&gt; stack trace at my fingertips. After checking by hand, I might change \n&gt; it to a \n&gt; useful assertion. I might even leave it in there until I can write a \n&gt; better \n&gt; test. I try not to wait more than ten minutes before writing the \n&gt; test. :)\n&gt; \n&gt; J. B.
