Those types of tests are also called\ndeveloper-tests for that reason.\n\nIf you want to specify your system with tests &quot;up front&quot; sort of to\nhave a checklist &quot;when that thing is green it is done, take the next\nread thing and continue&quot; I think automated acceptance testing with FIT\nor similar is what you need. Those tools are complementary to\ndeveloper tests (it is not either or).\n\nI got the impression that you thought that someone else (like a\ntester) specifies what should be done as a test and then checks it in\nand someone else (a developer) implements it. When doing TDD you can\nnever check in code that does not compile or fails any developer\ntests. I got that impression reading between the lines in this\ncomment:\n\n&gt; But practically, I can&#39;t write such a test as a Java class in Eclipse\n&gt; without it failing to compile and thus breaking our automatic build\n&gt; procedures.\n\nCompilation errors are also failures so as soon as something doesn&#39;t\ncompile you fix it but adding the code to fix the compilation problem.\nRobert C Martin puts it like this:\n\n&quot;Over the years I have come to describe Test Driven Development in\nterms of three simple rules. They are:\n\n1. You are not allowed to write any production code unless it is to\nmake a failing unit test pass.\n   2. You are not allowed to write any more of a unit test than is\nsufficient to fail; and compilation failures are failures.\n   3. You are not allowed to write any more production code than is\nsufficient to pass the one failing unit test.&quot;\n-- Robert C Martin\n\nIt is elaborated here:\nhttp://butunclebob.com/ArticleS.UncleBob.TheThreeRulesOfTdd\n\nOf course it is possible that I read too much between the lines.\n/Joakim Ohlrogge\n\n",
