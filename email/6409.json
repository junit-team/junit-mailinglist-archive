The<br/>\nimportant thing, however, is to instill the notion of OO purity, which is<br/>\nharder, perhaps, than just teaching the language.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor example: the GoF patterns book is a must, but I think it is not a text<br/>\nthat you can give to someone until they have a grounding in OO techniques.<br/>\n<br/>\nYour thoughts?<br/>\n<br/>\nManuel Amago.<br/>\n<br/>\n-----------------------------------------------<br/>\nDISCLAIMER<br/>\nI know this group is not for this type of question, which is why I<br/>\nexplicitly labelled this thread as OT (Off Topic).  I hope you will forgive<br/>\nmy impertinence.  ;)<br/>\nBut, I greatly value the opinions of the people on this list, and I trust<br/>\nyour opinion on this particular issue.<br/>\n<br/>\n--------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nmail2web - Check your email from the web at<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://mail2web.com/\">http://mail2web.com/</a> .</div>",
