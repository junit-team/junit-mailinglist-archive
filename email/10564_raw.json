I&#39;m sure the archives have more, but here&#39;s\none of the suggestions I found interesting:\n\nTurn the sense of the test around.  Instead of a test for the bug that\nalways fails, turn it into a test for the erroneous behavior.  This\ntest will pass as long as the bug is in your code.  (which can make\nsense if you think of it as testing your assumptions about your\nlibrary)\n\nOnce the &quot;server guys&quot; get around to fixing it, your test will fail\nagain, and hopefully your test documentation will explain what it is\nyou need to do.\n\nOf course, if the nature of this bug is that the server-side fix will\njust fix it without changes on your end, I&#39;d be tempted to just send\nthe test to the server-side guys and forget about it.\n\n-Kevin\n\n--- Jonathan Oddy &lt;j.oddy@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Dear All,\n&gt; \n&gt; a developer noticed a UI bug [...] in certain  circumstances the \n&gt; server sends an additional erroneous event to the client.\n\n\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nGet better spam protection with Yahoo!
