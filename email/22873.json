They have to manually select to use the new version that has just appeared in the repo, and this way if their tests start failing, they will know that they can either fix them to work with the new version of junit, or revert to the previous version.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Interesting.  I was under the impression that it was possible to<br/>\n&gt; simply depend on the _latest_ version of a package--indeed, that the<br/>\n&gt; ability to get upgraded versions automatically was one of the<br/>\n&gt; benefits/risks of maven.  Perhaps I&#39;ve just learned something new.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   David Saff<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; I am considering of taking up on this task with pushing junit to the public Maven repo, but I have to first learn what is exactly the process for this (perhaps signing up at Apache as contributor, or smt).<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Bogdan<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a>, David Saff &lt;david@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; On Tue, Aug 17, 2010 at 6:28 PM, pniederw &lt;pniederw@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; I&#39;ve noticed that JUnit includes an (outdated) version of Hamcrest.
