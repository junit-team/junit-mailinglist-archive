A few weeks (maybe months) after you start<br/>\nusing JUnit seriously, you&#39;ll realize you need to use data driven test<br/>\ndesign to eliminate duplication of test code.  When we got to that<br/>\npoint, we wrote some handy-dandy Java utility code to make it easy to<br/>\nextract rows of data from an Excel spreadsheet.  Then we can cycle<br/>\nthrough a single JUnit test 300 times with different data.  We&#39;ve found<br/>\nit&#39;s often easier to understand the test data if it&#39;s in a tabular<br/>\nformat (a spreadsheet) than if it&#39;s written directly into the Java code.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nTodd.</div>",
