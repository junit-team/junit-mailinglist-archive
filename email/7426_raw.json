Thats how I \n&gt; understand Design by Contract. You write your method definition and \n&gt; then you write the contract for it. Then you implement your method. \n\nAnd then you need to somehow run the system through different scenarios,\nso it seems to me.\n\n&gt; Now the great thing: When you compile your code the implementation \n&gt; can be checked whether it obeys the contract. If not, a compile error \n&gt; is thrown. That it!\n\nHave you tried this? AFAIK, contracts are checked at runtime, not\ncompile time.\n\nDon&#39;t know about JML, though I wonder how they would do it at compile\ntime...\n\n&gt; No JUnit test needed! Not TDD needed! Besides \n&gt; this, a contract serves as a documentation.\n\nUnit tests do that, too. They even serve as examples on how the code is\nexpected to be used - DBC doesn&#39;t do that.\n\n&gt; And it can use invariants \n&gt; which JUnit will always lack of.\n\nOTOH, DBC can&#39;t test the interaction of several objects as intensive as\nJunit can.\n\n&gt; Now come on and don&#39;t tell me: &quot;We always used JUnit, most people do, \n&gt; why do you little inexperienced programer think you have a better \n&gt; idea than people like Gamma or Fowler?&quot;\n\nI&#39;d rather suggest to *try* both your idea and Junit (and possibly even\nTDD) for a reasonable time and *then* report about your findings.\n\n&gt; I am not satisfied with the JUnit and TDD &quot;paradigma&quot;.\n\nThat&#39;s OK.\n\n&gt; They are \n&gt; originated because of a *poverty* in Java programing language. If \n&gt; Java would support proper Design by Contract and a compiler for that \n&gt; than no one would bother with JUnit and TDD.\n\nThat somehow contradicts the existence of EiffelUnit, doesn&#39;t it? See\nhttp://c2.com/cgi/wiki?DesignByContractVsProgrammerTests\n\nBTW, there are implementations of DBC for Java - and TDDers using it are\nreporting that DBC and Junit are rather complementing.\n\nRegards, Ilja\n\n\n",
