I suppose one possibility is that the assert is \n&gt; run, passes and \n&gt; you&#39;re surprised. That should shock you immediately and not \n&gt; allow you to \n&gt; forget. :)\n\nMaybe both, but foremost the first -- I&#39;d like to know that the assert was\npicked up.  \n\nWhile I know the goal is to add assertions that should fail, I do sometimes\nend up with assertions that pass immediately, and I can&#39;t always figure out\na way to have avoided that.\n\n",
