We use a very unknown (and very bad in my\nopinion) framework called JCoffee which uses Entity\nBeans (CMP of course) internally.\n\nSince I don&#39;t know very much about &quot;native&quot; Entity\nBeans, it is maybe hard to describe to you our design.\n\nOkay, I&#39;ll read Chapter 11 and come back to you if it\ndoesn&#39;t solve my question.\n\nBut can you (or someone else) please tell me this:\n- Do you test validation rules with JUnit (such as\nmaxLength(10))?\n- Do you test your Java finder methods (internally EJB\nQL, HQL, SQL or whatever)?\n- Do you test pre-initializations of business objects\ninstances (like Article, Customer...)?\n\n\n--- &quot;J. B. Rainsberger&quot; &lt;jbrains@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; haefeleuser wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Do we do too much testing here? How do you test\n&gt; these things? Or don&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; you test them or only some of them? Is there any\n&gt; code example of such\n&gt; &gt; a test? What about the finders and the validation\n&gt; rules: Do you test them?\n&gt; \n&gt; DAOs are merely a facade to the persistence\n&gt; mechanism. As such, they \n&gt; only map data types and construct SQL statements, if\n&gt; that. Test that: \n&gt; does the DAO properly look up the right EJB in JNDI?\n&gt; I recommend having \n&gt; a constructor for each DAO that accepts a Context\n&gt; which you can fake \n&gt; out. In the fake context, put a mock entity bean\n&gt; component interface and \n&gt; tell it to expect the right method name with the\n&gt; right parameters.\n&gt; \n&gt; Since the persistence mechanism is CMP EJB, test the\n&gt; entity beans \n&gt; themselves in the container only to the extent\n&gt; you&#39;re paranoid about CMP \n&gt; not working. I don&#39;t recommend trying to test your\n&gt; bean class with \n&gt; fake/mock CMP interfaces. That&#39;s painful. You could\n&gt; write some tests to \n&gt; verify the CMP metadata by merely parsing the\n&gt; deployment descriptors.\n&gt; \n&gt; This is mostly covered in Chapters 10 and 11 of\n&gt; _JUnit Recipes_.\n&gt; -- \n&gt; J.
