I document everything. even tests! Especially since I am in a large company setting, if the next guy comes along at looks at my tests, he can see some of the comments I have made. Maybe not make some of the same mistakes. etc... It is never, ever, a bad idea to document.\n\n\n&quot;J. B. Rainsberger&quot; &lt;jbrains@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;So said icepickorama on 2003-06-30 --------------------\n&gt;Hi,\n&gt;\n&gt;Does anyone know of an existing tool or method one could use to\n&gt;generate a report of unit tests in a source file?  I find that I\n&gt;usually write my unit tests (using JUnit of course) and then I create\n&gt;another document which duplicates a lot of the comments that already\n&gt;exist in my test code (essentially each test has a description of\n&gt;what&#39;s being tested).  I think it would be incredibly useful if there\n&gt;were a way to generate these automatically, maybe using javadoc tags?\n&gt;Has anyone seen or used something similar?\n\nA silly question: why are you writing comments describing what the test does? Doesn&#39;t the source code already say that?\n\n\nJ. B.
