Whenever I find it difficult to write a test for a \n&gt; method,\n&gt; I\n&gt;  &gt; ask myself whether it&#39;s the method&#39;s fault.\n&gt; \n&gt;     As a newbie to junit I&#39;m still trying to understand how to judge if when\n&gt; its &#39;difficult&#39; to write a test for a method. My question was sparked\n&gt; because I was in what I would call a laborous position - multiple code paths\n&gt; so multiple test cases. I had 30 test cases for one method, amounting to 300\n&gt; lines of code. Is this tedious or difficult. In JUnit world, does tedious ==\n&gt; difficult?\n\nI think &quot;tedious == difficult&quot; answers false, so tedium is not as strong \na warning signal as difficulty; however it /is/ a warning signal.\n\nIf you want to learn how to make those judgments, then I believe you \nhave to practice. Presumably your method is structured like this.\n\nbigMethod:\n     someCode\n     if (condition)\n         truePart\n     else\n         falsePart\n     end\n     moreCode\nend\n\nIn other words, let&#39;s say there&#39;s a top-level &quot;if&quot; statement.\n\nSo make bigMethod look exactly like the above. Extract everything else \ninto methods. Now, can you test someCode, truePart, falsePart and \nmoreCode on their own? If not, apply the same refactoring again, and \nagain, and again... eventually you&#39;ll see how you could fix the testing \ntedium with refactoring.\n\nIf your testing tedium is due to wanting to run the same test with 100 \ndifferent sets of data, you need better tests (Parameterized Test Case). \nIf your testing tedium is due to high cyclomatic complexity, you need \nbetter production code (refactor, extract method, move method, and so on).\n\nTake care.\n-- \nJ.
