I have no problem with<br/>\n&gt;&gt; saying that a TestCollector dynamically creates a TestSuite from a<br/>\n&gt;&gt; collection of TestCases.  That is understandable.  I do have a<br/>\n </span></blockquote>problem<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; with the TestCase being treated as a TestSuite though.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;OK, I&#39;ll try to address this one.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;TestCase is a mechanism to allow fixture reuse.  An instance of a<br/>\n&gt;TestCase builds a fixture, runs a single test, and tears down the<br/>\n&gt;fixture. By allowing TestCase to contain multiple tests (i.e. public<br/>\n&gt;void testXXX() methods) you can share a fixture definition.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Put another way, TestCase is NOT a way to conceptually group tests. <br/>\n&gt;Each TestCase subclass represents a fixture, and contains a group of<br/>\n&gt;tests that run in the context of that fixture. Once you realize this,<br/>\n&gt;you&#39;ll find yourself switching (as I did some time ago) from having a<br/>\n&gt;TestCase for each class you are testing (with a overly generic fixture<br/>\n&gt;of which pieces were used by the different tests) to organizing tests<br/>\n&gt;around the fixtures, with less regard for the classes being tested by<br/>\n&gt;each TestCase.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;TestSuite is a mechanism for grouping a collection of TestCase<br/>\n </span></blockquote>instances<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;and running them sequentially.  So, TestCase has the ability to create<br/>\n </span></blockquote>a<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;TestSuite containing all instances of itself (using reflection to<br/>\n </span></blockquote>create<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;an instance for each constituent test).  Also, you have the ability to<br/>\n&gt;create explicit TestSuites by subclassing TestSuite and writing a<br/>\n </span></blockquote>custom<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;suite() method.  This is useful for collecting together groups of<br/>\n&gt;smaller TestSuites which can be other custom TestSuites, or TestSuites<br/>\n&gt;generated by TestCases.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Both TestSuite and TestCase implement the Test interface. The<br/>\n&gt;TestRunners work with things that are Tests, hence we can point at any<br/>\n&gt;Test (ie TestSuite or TestCase) and recursively run all the contained<br/>\n&gt;tests.  The internal nodes are TestSuites and the leaves are<br/>\n </span></blockquote>TestCases.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;I hope that makes things clearer.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Renaming TestCase to TestFixture would have made it clearer for me in<br/>\nthe beginning. The use of the term &quot;test case&quot; to represent a<br/>\ncollection of tests with common fixture is a nonstandard use of the<br/>\nterm. It sounds to me like nothing more than a name that looked good at<br/>\nfirst, but wasn&#39;t changed when perhaps it could have been. Everything<br/>\nis a TestSuite, although most of them are automatically generated for<br/>\nus. Once I made that connexion, everything became clear.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Anyone think this would make a good topic for the TDD Coad Letter?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yes.<br/>\n<br/>\nJ.
