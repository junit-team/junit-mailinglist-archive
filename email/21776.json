I&#39;ll check out CPsuite and TestNG.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nDavid Saff wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; We&#39;ve made a couple passes at a built-in grouping system in the past,<br/>\n&gt; but our first couple passes didn&#39;t seem to fit in well with the rest<br/>\n&gt; of the design.  Looking at the code now, it looks like a much easier<br/>\n&gt; feature, perhaps for early 4.8.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Question: would you rather see the tests as ignored, or not see them at all?<br/>\n&gt;   <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;m glad to hear you folks are aiming to support this use case!<br/>\n<br/>\nI could see people wanting both behaviors. In my case, I don&#39;t want to <br/>\nsee them at all.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe problem I&#39;m trying to address is that this project recently added a <br/>\ndatabase to the mix, so  a small number of tests have increased AllTests <br/>\nrunning time by 20x. Developers now run the tests a lot less. I want to <br/>\ngive them a single FastTests target to run that gets everything except  <br/>\nones I&#39;ve marked as slow.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn previous projects, I&#39;ve also tagged tests that depend on particular <br/>\nshared resources, like some common app server or database, or an <br/>\nexternal, not-always-reliable test server. For those, I&#39;d lean more <br/>\ntoward being able to ignore them, as turning them off would be temporary.<br/>\n<br/>\nWilliam</div>",
