What doesvTestNG do to prevent me from=\r\n\nmaking mistakes when using mutable state?\nb) I have occasionally made mist=\r\nakes where immutable objects become\nmutable.  Stupid mistakes, to be sure, =\r\nbut that&#39;s why I write tests.\n\n\n&gt; &gt;  In JUnit 3.8, you can use TestSetup fo=\r\nr this state, and in JUnit 4, you\n&gt; can\n&gt; &gt;  use @BeforeClass with statics\n=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; Statics are extremely problematic with integration tools (ant, maven\n&gt; =\r\nor IDE&#39;s) and they are also inherently a lot less thread-safe,\n&gt; therefore =\r\npreventing you from leveraging parallelism.\n\n\nI&#39;ve written tests that use s=\r\ntatic state and work fine from ant, but I don&#39;t\nknow everything.  Can you f=\r\nill me in?\n\n\n&gt; &gt; or you can search Google for &quot;JUnit\n&gt; &gt;  OneInstance.class=\r\n&quot;, which will give you a solution allowing you to only\n&gt; &gt;  instantiate you=\r\nr test class once.\n&gt;\n&gt; Similary, I have always found JUnit tests hard to ru=\r\nn reliably when\n&gt; they start depending on specialized runners.  Do the Ecli=\r\npse and IDEA\n&gt; plug-ins support @RunWith?\n\n\nEclipse: Yes, natively.\nIDEA: I=\r\n believe there was a bug a while back.  I&#39;ve put it on my todo list\nto try =\r\nit out on the latest public beta (assuming there is one), but if\nsomeone ha=\r\ns already tried it, I&#39;d love to know.\n\nJust to be clear, JUnit 4 can replic=\r\nate both &quot;one instance for all tests&quot;\nand &quot;one instance for each test&quot; beha=\r\nvior in a way that works seamlessly\nwith, I know, ant and Eclipse, and will=\r\n eventually be possible, when bugs\nare fixed, in other runners.  Of course,=\r\n each tool must be opinionated in\nits defaults, but I assume that most tool=\r\n users appreciate the final\ndecision being up to them.  I&#39;d ask about TestN=\r\nG, but this is the JUnit\nlist.  :-)\n\nAnyway, I think the confusion of the o=\r\nriginal author is still\n&gt; justified:  since both the constructor and setUp(=\r\n) are invoked before\n&gt; every test method, why have both?\n\n\nI&#39;ll leave it up=\r\n to the original author to say whether several good-faith\nattempts to answe=\r\nr that exact question have failed.\n\n   David Saff\n\n\n[Non-text portions of t=\r\nhis message have been removed]\n\n\n",
