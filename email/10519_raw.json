This is nice, but I would like to see a couple of things.\n&gt; \n&gt; 1. I would like a checkbox which means add all those testmethods but\n&gt; commented out initially. This would save my usual next action which is\n&gt; to go through manually commenting them out - in some classes, this is\n&gt; a lot of work.\n&gt; \n&gt; 2. I would like to see a checkbox and textfield which would allow me\n&gt; to append a suffix to each testmethod. At my present stage of using\n&gt; JUnit, I find I start out with the test method given me by JUnit\n&gt; automagically,  then I populate the body with my test, then I\n&gt; copy/paste the testmethod, add 001 to the end of the first of them,\n&gt; 002 to the end of the second one, and go on to edit the body of the\n&gt; second of these testmethods.\n&gt; \n&gt; (I know I said a couple, but pretty please..?)\n\nTwo comments.\n\nFirst, you do not appear to be talking about JUnit, but rather about \nsome IDE containing features for &quot;helping&quot; you write JUnit tests. If so, \nthen that has nothing, whatever, to do with JUnit.\n\nSecond, do not number tests. Name your test methods according to the \nspecial case they test. For example: testWithdrawOverdrawn(), \ntestWithdrawInvalidAmount(), testWithdrawInvalidAccount(), and so on.\n\n&gt; 3. It would be great if while viewing an existing testcase file, I\n&gt; could bring up some JUnit wizard that lets me add more testmethod(s)\n&gt; from the base or, I guess, even some other, class.\n\nAdding test methods consists of just writing methods. No wizard should \nbe required, in any IDE.\n-- \nJ. B.
