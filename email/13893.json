I could use<br/>\nsome advice.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome background: I&#39;ve come into a project that has no<br/>\ntest coverage and has some pretty aggregious code...<br/>\nmeanwhile new features are being slowly added.  The<br/>\nthing feels like it&#39;s on the verge of imploding, and<br/>\nthis is the calm before the storm.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m going through the process right now of adding test<br/>\ncases, but as I write them I&#39;m constantly fighting the<br/>\nurge to fix stuff.  My question: is it better to write<br/>\nall the tests first, then go back to fixing what&#39;s<br/>\nbroken, or to fix the bugs and &quot;smelly&quot; code as you go?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n__________________________________ <br/>\nDiscover Yahoo! <br/>\nUse Yahoo! to plan a weekend, have fun online and more.
