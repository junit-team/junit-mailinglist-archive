Anything can be overdone, and therefore result =\r\nin loss of benefit.  The trick is optimizing your outcome.\n\nI don&#39;t think t=\r\nhat most people who are truly practicing TDD (following the intent, if not =\r\nthe letter) could be &quot;obsessed over tests to the exclusion of customer sati=\r\nsfaction&quot;.\n\nI look at TDD as being driven largely by customer need.  If I d=\r\non&#39;t understand the customer need (and therefore how to satisfy them), then=\r\n I don&#39;t know what to test for.  If I don&#39;t know what to test for, I don&#39;t =\r\nknow what to write.  Therefore, if my tests are based on meeting customer n=\r\need (which drives customer satisfaction), then I inherently should improve =\r\ncustomer satisfaction with every test I write, because it will result in co=\r\nde that meets their needs.\n\nBeing focused on the customer, though, I will a=\r\nlso realize that writing umpteen-million tests for one piece of functionali=\r\nty, to the detriment of not creating other necessary functionality, would n=\r\not enhance customer satisfaction.  :)\n\nIt&#39;s a balancing act, but well worth=\r\n the effort.\n\n\nmy two cents,\nDianne\n\n\n-------------- Original message -----=\r\n--------- \nFrom: &quot;C=C3=A9dric Beust =E2=99=94 &quot; &lt;cbeust@...&gt; \nOn 8/1=\r\n5/06, J.
