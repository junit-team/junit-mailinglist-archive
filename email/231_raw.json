Just extract\nthat, update that file, and readd it to the jar.

I&#39;ve had a look in the FAQ and found the\n&gt; relevant passage.\n&gt; The problem is I can&#39;t find the\n&gt; junit.util.excluded.properties file so that\n&gt; I can exclude log4j. Where ought it to be?\n&gt;\n&gt; Incidentally, I&#39;ve now downloaded Junit 3.4 which I was going to use\n&gt; instead.  However the sourceforge download doesn&#39;t have any of the\n&gt; TestRunner classes.  However some of the postings on this\n&gt; list imply that\n&gt; 3.4 *does* have the UI components.  Where can I find them?\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;m sorry to keep asking questions, I guess I&#39;ve got my stupid head on\n&gt; today.  thanks for your time, APC\n\n\n",
