Factories for\n&gt; instance.  \n\nI think Jason was including the factory approach in the\n&#39;globals/static&#39; category, especially since you say:\n\n&gt; The Factory could be globally\n&gt; accessible, if that makes sense or pass it in at creation time. \n\nI think the question he was getting at (or at least one that I run\ninto) is how to create static factories that do useful things (like\nhand out database connections), but still use mockObjects for unit\ntesting.\n\nUsing threadlocals seems like an interesting approach, although I&#39;ll\nadmit I kind of feel bad for doing it.  Can someone think of specific\nproblems with this approach, as it otherwise seems like a good idea: \nMy unit tests get to specify the static factories for their test\nenvironment, and it avoids stepping on the toes of other tests. \nFurthermore, my test can configure the factories in a number of ways,\ntesting a number of possible configurations.\n\n\n&gt; Let&#39;s say I have a DBQuery that obviously needs a DatabaseConnection\n&gt; to do much of its work.  The query doesn&#39;t need the connection for\nits\n&gt; full life-span, only for the short period of time in which to run \n&gt; against the DB, perhaps the rest of the time is doing maintenance\nwork \n&gt; or creating Record objects to represent a row in the DB, etc.  So, I \n&gt; make a Factory (in this case probably a pool) available from which\nthe \n&gt; query can grab a connection when it needs it and then give it back.  \n&gt; The connection too has things that it may need only for a short\nperiod \n&gt; of time and can give them up -- i.e. a Prepared or CallableStatement.\n \n&gt;\n&gt; It can get the statement from a factory it has access to and then\ngive \n&gt; it back when it&#39;s done.\n\nRight -- how do you use MockObjects with that?\n\n-Kevin\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
