I wrote my test class, and i saw that the side effects <br/>\noccured as i planned.<br/>\n<br/>\nI create a new method, without return, that basically verifies some <br/>\nconditions, and so it call the other methods (already tested) in <br/>\nacordance with these conditions.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, my doubt is the following one:<br/>\n<br/>\nHow i make the test of this new method without remaking the test <br/>\nalready done?</div>",
