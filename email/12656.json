    "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1225722556\">Paul -<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for the reply.  Unfortunately, we are already doing that.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe run a nightlybuild with tests.  It copies the previous results to a backup-reports directory, cleans the reports directory, and then creates the current results html files.  Then, we send out an e-mail to the team, with the links to the various reports (for different &#39;chunks&#39; of code), both current and previous.<br/>\n<br/>\nEvery morning, I am opening those reports and copying the highest level data (from the summary section -&gt; #tests, #failures, #errors) into an excel spreadsheet.<br/>\n<br/>\nCurrently, we are trying to get our testing back under control - many iterations of allowing people to say their stories were complete without appropriate - or even working - tests.  Additionally, in the past, we have found that we have a velocity treshhold - after which our testing goes downhill.  So, we have a need to maintain this historical information, over the life of the project.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am looking for a way to automate this.  What I&#39;m thinking of is:<br/>\nwhen the reporting functionality totals the summary numbers, it could also output to another file type (ideally, straight into an excel spreadsheet; minimally, into a file that can be used as a data source for a spreadsheet) a configurable data set: date, time, #tests, #failures, #errors, #time.<br/>\n<br/>\nDianne<br/>\n<br/>\n-------------- Original message -------------- <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nDianne Doss asked<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIs there an automated way to output the summary data (#tests,<br/>\n#errors, #failures) from my JUnit Report to an external file<br/>\n(possibly xls, or a file accessible by spreadsheet) in order to<br/>\nmaintain a history of our results?<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the ideal world, there would never be any errors or failures, but<br/>\nthe point of the testing is to make us confident in making code<br/>\nchanges.  We run a nightlybuild regression, so the next morning I<br/>\ncan see if I missed anything (sometimes the failures are well<br/>\nremoved from the actual class that was changed).<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, we would like to be able to record historical data of the<br/>\nfluctuations.  In the past, manually, we have found that the<br/>\nerrors/failures go up when we get above a certain velocity.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for any insight that can be provided.<br/>\n<br/>\nDianne Doss<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nDear Doss,<br/>\n<br/>\n              If you are generating JUnit Report through Ant, definitely you<br/>\nshould write one build.xml file. Before generating new report, why not you<br/>\ntake copy of the previous report.  In Ant API  contains copy tag and move<br/>\ntag. So<br/>\nfirst step you take a back up using Copy/ Move tag.<br/>\nSecond step you clear your old report using delete tag.<br/>\nThird step create report folder again.<br/>\nFinally you generate new report.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPaul Domnic J.<br/>\n<br/>\nScandent Group<br/>\n4th Floor, KRM Centre,<br/>\nNo.2, Harrington Road,<br/>\nChetpet,<br/>\nChennai 600 031<br/>\nIndia<br/>\n<br/>\nTel:+91 44  5211 8090<br/>\nFax:+91 44  5211 8068<br/>\nImportant Email Information :- The  information  in  this  email is<br/>\nconfidential and may  be  legally  privileged.
