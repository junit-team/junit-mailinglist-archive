If you get the code to break, how \nare you going to repeat it? And then how are you going to know if you&#39;ve \nfixed the bug?\n\nMuch better to throw *every* possibility at the code, rather than just a \nrandom selection. You&#39;d be surprised at the number of bugs this \nuncovers. I&#39;ve discovered quite a few bugs in the JDK itself by \nexhaustively testing some things Sun never bothered to do more than \nsample testing on. I just found another one this morning. There are 32 \ncharacters in the ISO-8859-7 encoding that Java 1.5 can&#39;t correctly \nencode. (This one&#39;s a regression. It worked in 1.4.)\n\nIf the problem space is so large that you really can&#39;t test every \npossibility, then write a program to generate random samples and *log* \nany that fail so you can add them to the test suite. That way you can \nrun the few failing tests repeatedly until (and after) they&#39;ve been \nfixed. However the actual generation of the random samples should be \nseparated from your unit test suite.  Random generation of test data is \nantithetical to test driven development. Test driven development \nrequires reproducible tests.\n\n-- \nElliotte Rusty Harold  elharo@...\nXML in a Nutshell 3rd Edition Just Published!\nhttp://www.cafeconleche.org/books/xian3/\nhttp://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0596007647/cafeaulaitA/ref=nosim\n\n",
