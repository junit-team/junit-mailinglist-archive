Because testdata you will be having all sorts of data.Once if you know the scenario of the test you should be in a position to generate you own test data instead of using real data.<br/>\n <br/>\nReal data will be there or not in the real time environment. so data uploading and data remove will happen eveyday in the real time environment. so you will not be getting different kind of test data for your test scenarios. so try to use only test data instead of real data.<br/>\n <br/>\nThanks to all !!!!<br/>\nPraveen<br/>\n<br/>\nAnurag Setia &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:anuragsetia2000@...\">anuragsetia2000@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\nWe normally use test data only.. just that the schema is filled with data from the live db schema every week.

One of our projects runs daily against <br/>\nthe stock markets, so the data changes daily. In addition to new data <br/>\nfrom the daily trading, stock symbols change, and change back again <br/>\nweekly. So using the live data would result in constant breakage of test <br/>\ncases.<br/>\n   However, I agree that real data has exactly the kind of real-world <br/>\nanomalies that one needs to test against, and I know of no way to fake <br/>\nthose kinds of data.<br/>\n<br/>\n  So, we use several test databases, which are snapshots of the <br/>\nreal-world data from the live sites. This way we have static datasets to <br/>\ntest against, but we have all the kinds of data anomalies that our <br/>\nsoftware encounters in the real runs.  It requires a bit of storage, but <br/>\nonce we have a set of test cases to run against, we never have to touch <br/>\nthem again.  As the project has grown, and we have discovered new tests <br/>\n(to handle anomalies that we had not seen previously) we add a new test <br/>\nsuite that references a new snapshot of the real-world environment, <br/>\nwhile the older test cases continue to refer to their own snapshots.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis seems to work for us, in a fairly dynamic real world domain,<br/>\n<br/>\nJim<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJames P.

With &quot;test data&quot; <br/>\n&gt;I mean data which I create in my test program and which I persist in <br/>\n&gt;the database. After the test finished, I delete the test data (with an <br/>\n&gt;EntityGarbageCollector).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;But our new project leader thinks we should use only real data (&quot;one <br/>\n&gt;dataset for all tests&quot;). I don&#39;t think that this would work. We need <br/>\n&gt;both strategies I think, even if one solution seems to be redundant.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;To only use real test data has big disadvantages in my opinion:<br/>\n&gt;- if data changes (real data does), then tests break<br/>\n&gt;- you need much more real data than test data to cover all the <br/>\n&gt;boundaries and use cases<br/>\n&gt;- if you add real data or remove real data from the dataset, tests <br/>\n&gt;might break<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;What do you think about it?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>---------------------------------<br/>\nYahoo!
