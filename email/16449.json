One might get really<br/>\nconfused by the mixture of different conventions (as I did, having<br/>\nstarted the research).<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you want to focus on the newest version od JUnit, watch out reading<br/>\nthe tutorials. As I said, the two versions have totally different<br/>\nnaming conventions, the older one being deprecated by the new one.<br/>\nHere&#39;s a brilliant advice on how to recognize the two styles:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.instrumentalservices.com/content/view/45/52/\">http://www.instrumentalservices.com/content/view/45/52/</a><br/>\n<br/>\nSad but true, if I hadn&#39;t found that very article, I would still be<br/>\nconfused. Even though the docs attached to the downloadable version of<br/>\nJUnit 4.0 cover the new convention, the samples are still unchanged. <br/>\n<br/>\nHave fun learning, as I&#39;m having for a few days :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAnna Skawi&#324;ska</div>",
