A protected method is\naccessible within the package. The alternative to your point 4) is to make\nyour methods &#39;package&#39; and have your Test class in the same package. (IMHO\nit is near the first solution, a kind of pollution: private methods are ued\nwithin a class in specific conditions. They should be tested with these\nconditions by the public method or the package).\n\n\n",
