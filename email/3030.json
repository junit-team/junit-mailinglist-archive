Do you know that a counter which should be decreasing is increasing<br/>\ninstead (or never going down)? Do you see a duplicate element come up in<br/>\nwhat should be a unique traversal? Is there something that is exposed<br/>\nwhich you can check to determine that the loop really won&#39;t terminate or<br/>\nsomething you could expose? There probably isn&#39;t much chance, but<br/>\nif you could, it might make your life easier.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Sat, 20 Oct 2001, David Corbin wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; I found a bug, so I want to write a test that exposes that bug.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; How does one write a unit test that exposes an infinte loop?

How do you expose it with out the test<br/>\n&gt; hanging?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The only solution I can see is to use two threads, and set a maximum time<br/>\n&gt; for the test to run.  While I&#39;ve done it before, I really hate putting a<br/>\n&gt; time-limit specific tests, as every system behaves differently, and they<br/>\n&gt; behave differently at different times (it&#39;s that non-deterministic thing<br/>\n&gt; that I didn&#39;t understand in college :)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thanks for any input....<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; David Corbin<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\">junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
