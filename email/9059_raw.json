B. Rainsberger&quot; &lt;jbrains@r...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt; &gt;So said rahuls_25 on 2003-08-07 --------------------\n&gt; &gt;Hi,\n&gt; &gt;I am a newbie to JUnit and my company uses automatic build to run \n&gt; &gt;test cases written in Junit for each java class. But, we are not \n&gt; &gt;testing EJBs currently as it would involve creating .ear file and \n&gt; &gt;testing. So, can anybody tell me what is the best way to test \nEntity, \n&gt; &gt;session and message beans and servlets? Is there anyway to test \nJSPs?\n&gt; &gt;Any samples/links provided will be much appreciated.\n&gt; \n&gt; My coauthor and I will devote approximately 100 pages to this in \nour upcoming book. Please understand that we can&#39;t do it by \ntomorrow. :)\n&gt; \n&gt; Since you are testing code already written, my strong suggestion is \nto start by testing through the end-user interface or using a package \nlike Cactus. Thorough and fast testing of EJBs requires a certain \ndesign approach that not many people take.\n&gt; \n\nI just read an article titled as &quot;Test Infect Your Enterprise \nJavaBeans&quot; from java.sun.com. I am not sure the approach presented \nthere is still recommended or not as it is dated back to 2000. The \nweb page link is  \n\nhttp://developer.java.sun.com/developer/technicalArticles/J2EE/testinf\nect/#resources\n\nThanks & Regards!\n\n\n",
