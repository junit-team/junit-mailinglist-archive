I \nd=\r\non&#39;t see\n&gt; how the assertion would fail though. Nor do I think it would be =\r\na \ngood test\n&gt; but I guess that depends on what you write in the constructo=\r\nrs of \nyou\n&gt; classes I guess.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message ha=\r\nve been removed]\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
