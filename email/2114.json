I�ll volunteer to do some (or most) of the<br/>\nrewriting, with Vladimir acting as the final editor.  We can save the<br/>\noriginal comments page as a background link for the summary page.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf we base the examples on the sample code shipped with JUnit, we<br/>\nshould be able to expand these �Best Practices� topics into a very<br/>\nuseful tutorial for new users. <br/>\n<br/>\nMany thanks to J. B. Rainsberger for taking the time to put this<br/>\ntogether.<br/>\n<br/>\nMike<br/>\n<br/>\nPS to J. B. Rainsberger.  I�ve communicated with you on other issues.<br/>\n I think you could make a valued contribution in helping to rewrite<br/>\nthe summaries.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- Vladimir Bossicard &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:vladimir@...\">vladimir@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; Is it possible for people to just submit request, so that we<br/>\n&gt; won&#39;t overwrite<br/>\n&gt; &gt; each other&#39;s change?  I can see that this will become a hot topic<br/>\n&gt; and there<br/>\n&gt; &gt; will be cases that several people changing it at the same time.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; and people with different point of views trying to expose &quot;or<br/>\n&gt; impose&quot; their ideas.  I think it&#39;s a great tool and hope that<br/>\n&gt; people will be responsible and not screw up everything.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; So let&#39;s give it a try and see the result in a couple of weeks.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -Vladimir<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nMake international calls for as low as $.04/minute with Yahoo!
