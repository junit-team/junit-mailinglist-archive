I am responsible to test an application that periodically \nsends a microsoft document thing to my mailbox. I can specify what \nemail address i can send my microsoft document to. I was wondering \nif there is a way in Junit that I can actually make sure that there \nis a document in my mailbox. Is the testing for such kind of \napplication possible with Junit? Is there a better suited tool for \ntesting such kind of application? Any help on this matter would \nappreciated. Thanks! ..\nAbhishek\n\n\n\n",
