As a matter of fact VisualAge Websphere Test environment is a real snail & lookups can take sometimes many seconds. My problem is the fact that the potential real issue is the latency in the response. <br/>\n<br/>\nI was wandering if someone could help in defining a way to avoid the overhead of the System.currentTimemillis() coded in the JunitPerf. On the production environment the biggest part of the response time is divided in three parts - believe - : <br/>\n  1. CurrentTime access<br/>\n  2. Naming access<br/>\n  3. CurrentTime access<br/>\n<br/>\nTo reduce the influence of the timing, I can loop the Naming Access, but then I get the caching kicking in.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf someone had an hint to keep the test as simple as possible (no looping on all the Names to access)...<br/>\n<br/>\nTx,<br/>\n<br/>\nThomas,</div>",
