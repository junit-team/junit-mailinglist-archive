Selenium seems to be\n&gt; &gt; nice, since it a=\r\nllows someone without much (or none at all)\n&gt; &gt; programming experience, as =\r\nour Product Owner to create those tests\n&gt; &gt; with Firefox Selenium IDE plug-=\r\nin.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; But time has come to integrate those tests to other JUnit tests=\r\n, so\n&gt; &gt; these can be run on CI server.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Is there any know-how or li=\r\nnk which could help. I already visited\n&gt; &gt; mavenium (http://mavenium.source=\r\nforge.net/index.html) and\n&gt; &gt; maven2-selenium plug-in\n&gt; &gt; site(http://mojo.=\r\ncodehaus.org/selenium-maven-plugin/index.html), but\n&gt; &gt; documentation is no=\r\nt quite clear, or at least I couldn&#39;t run my tests.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; As I understood=\r\n, selenium-rc should run automatically if defined in\n&gt; &gt; pom.xml and then S=\r\nelenium JUnit tests should run fine. What about\n&gt; &gt; jetty? Is it run implic=\r\nitly, or some server should be run? If not\n&gt; &gt; automatically, should it be =\r\nrun manually? In this case CI doesn&#39;t make\n&gt; &gt; sense, since you have to dep=\r\nloy application to some other server.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Huh...too many questions, I g=\r\nuess. I would be happy to have at least\n&gt; &gt; some answers.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; In genera=\r\nl, we much prefer Selenium Core to Selenium RC (which we\nhad used\n&gt; for a w=\r\nhile).  You can write all your Selenium Core tests in JUnit and\n&gt; they&#39;ll r=\r\nun in the browsers.  We even run our Se Core tests in\nparallel for\n&gt; maximu=\r\nm speed.\n&gt; \n&gt; We started an eLearning album called Mastering Selenium, yet =\r\nwe\naren&#39;t very\n&gt; far along on it.  When it gets more mature, you could chec=\r\nk it out,\nif you\n&gt; like.   Just ping me about it.\n&gt; \n&gt; -- \n&gt; best regards,\n=\r\n&gt; jk\n&gt; \n&gt; Industrial Logic, Inc.\n&gt; Joshua Kerievsky\n&gt; Founder, Extreme Prog=\r\nrammer & Coach\n&gt; http://industriallogic.com\n&gt; 866-540-8336 (toll free)\n&gt; 51=\r\n0-540-8336 (phone)\n&gt; Berkeley, California\n&gt; \n&gt; Learn Code Smells, Refactori=\r\nng and TDD at\n&gt; http://industriallogic.com/elearning\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; [Non-text port=\r\nions of this message have been removed]\n&gt;\n\n\n\n",
