Perhaps\n&gt;   every heretofore uncharted business domain may provide\n&gt;   artistic freedom for a software developer, but pretty soon,\n&gt;   it becomes yet another &quot;patternizable&quot;, &quot;automated testable&quot;\n&gt;   piece of software.\n\nThe software becomes those things, but not the work it takes to get to \nthat point. No process definition can make that work happen the way it \nneeds to happen. People have to think. CMM appears to be about \nMcDonaldizing work. You cannot McDonaldize building software, although \nyou can (and should!) McDonaldize other kinds of work.\n\n&gt;  &gt;  From what I understand the goal of CMM is to define a\n&gt;  &gt; process that even\n&gt;  &gt; a monkey could follow. Monkeys do not write software; people do.\n&gt; \n&gt;   perhaps the monkey refers to &quot;code monkeys&quot;...\n\nAt a minimum, but it is not limited to coding.\n\n&gt;   Again, my point is that a large part of software being built today\n&gt;   is grunt-work, which can and should be codified in a process.\n\nA large of part of building software today is gruntwork because we&#39;re \nnot pushing the reusable libraries that could remove the gruntwork.\n\nI cannot believe how much work I had to do to build a HardcodedResultSet \nin Java for my tests. It amazes me that NO ONE ON THE PLANET has made \nthis available on the web and publicized it. That floors me. That&#39;s why \nI&#39;m going to do it. That&#39;s why I use Jakarta Commons. I don&#39;t want to \nbuild what I can buy -- or even get free!\n\nThe gruntwork happens when people don&#39;t choose to reuse.\n\n&gt;  &gt; It drives towards more uniform results, certainly; but I don&#39;t know\n&gt;  &gt; about &quot;better software&quot;.\n&gt;  \n&gt;   At the end, if you&#39;re saying the concept of the CMM is BS, I don&#39;t\n&gt; agree. \n\nSince that is not what I said, don&#39;t worry.\n\nI said that a software company claiming it was CMM Level 5 is BS. I just \ndon&#39;t believe a software company could be CMM Level 5 and stay in \nbusiness. Other industries, yes; software, no.\n\n &gt; The very fact that we&#39;re using JUnit and other tools to\n&gt; complement our laziness (laziness being a compliment, of course, in\n&gt; software development) is evidence that we are trying to get from\n&gt; Initial to Repeatable (this word is JUnit all the way) to Defined\n&gt; to Managed to Optimized (refactor mercilessly).\n\nTrue, but it&#39;s the PRACTICES that are moving to CMM Level 5, and not the \nactual work of writing the software. We can&#39;t turn the brains off.\n\n&gt; if you&#39;re saying the process (documentation, documentation and more\n&gt; documentation) is flawed, I&#39;m with you.\n\nThat&#39;s true, too; although tangential to my point.\n\n&gt; Finally, I just took a look at http://www.sei.cmu.edu and found out\n&gt; that they&#39;re sunsetting the CMM and moving to CMMI, so maybe they\n&gt; did find out that most people out here cared two hoots about the\n&gt; process...\n\n&lt;shrug /&gt;\n-- \nJ.
