So i implemented a runner which i am discussing in a pull request http=\r\ns://github.com/KentBeck/junit/pull/503 as well.\n\nIf we introduced an annota=\r\ntion, e.g. @TypeSafe or @FailSafe, then the ClassNotFoundException could be=\r\n avoided due to an absent class in the classpath.\nWhat&#39;s your opinion?\n\n\nBR=\r\n, Tibor\n\n\n\n--- In junit@yahoogroups.com, &quot;sebastian_4711&quot; &lt;usenet@...&gt; wrot=\r\ne:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hello,\n&gt; \n&gt; we start using categories in a project to distinguish un=\r\nit and integration tests using database. Our requirement is to run unit tes=\r\nts from within Eclipse and using Maven.\n&gt; \n&gt; The experience was rather disa=\r\nppointing. \n&gt; \n&gt; The support for categories in Eclipse is completely missin=\r\ng.  Maven plugin did not work out of the box as the wrong test executor was=\r\n instantiated. Once this was fixed, we found that the category class must b=\r\ne available in the class path of all projects, else the plugin fails with a=\r\n ClassNotFoundException. \n&gt; \n&gt; Why are categories not plain strings as in T=\r\nestNG? This would prevent class not found exceptions and in addition remove=\r\ns the requirement to have a dependency on the single module containing the =\r\ncategories. If you like you can still use String constants to be &quot;name safe=\r\n&quot;.\n&gt; \n&gt; Evaluating TestNG as an alternative lead to the following results:\n=\r\n&gt; - Good support in the Eclipse Plugin and Maven\n&gt; -- Groups (=3D categorie=\r\ns) are found by the Eclipse plugin\n&gt; - TestNG does not create a new instanc=\r\ne per test. As a consequence all fields must be set in @BeforeMethod. Using=\r\n a normal constructor causes unexpected results.\n&gt; - @BeforeMethod is not e=\r\nxecuted, if a group is specified. There is a @BeforeGroup annotation which =\r\nmakes the whole thing much more complex.\n&gt; \n&gt; Best Regards\n&gt; \n&gt; Sebastian\n&gt;=\r\n\n\n\n",
