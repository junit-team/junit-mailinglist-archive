It looks promising, but I have not tested it.  My next &quot;spare time&quot; \n&gt; project is to retrofit the parsing I mentioned above to use HTMLParser.\n\nHTMLParser does handle lots of dirty html, and its been built ground-up with a large suit of tests taken from real-world html. I started the project 2 years back, as other parsers looked too complex to me at the time (most of them still do). \n\nRight now, the HTMLParser project is entering an interesting phase. Together with Josh Kerievsky, we&#39;ve been continuously refactoring and adding capabilities to do unit-testing of html and xml content - this helped us to unit-test xsl stylesheets. \n\nFor html testing, the parser treats html as dirty xml, and there is a method - assertXmlEquals() - this does the job of xml comparison - with the advantage of being able to comapre &quot;dirty xml/html&quot;  - tags don&#39;t need to be closed. And yet, tag sets like \n&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;  and &lt;td/&gt; will be considered equivalent. \n\nKen, if you need any help in using the parser, feel free to post questions on the htmparser-user list.\n\nRegards,\nSomik\n********************************************\n  Somik Raha                     \n  Extreme Programmer and Coach   \n  Industrial Logic, Inc.          \n  somik@...      \n  http://industriallogic.com \n  Voice : 510-540-8336      \n  Toll-free : 866-540-8336           \n  Fax   : 510-540-8936            \n********************************************\n.. the major danger in vertical thinking is not that of being trapped \nby the obvious but of failing to realize that one may be trapped by\nthe obvious.
