I think the Stream abstraction is really elegant and\n&gt;  &gt; much prefer to work with it than directly with files.\n&gt;\n&gt;  No reason we can&#39;t have both.\n\nWhile that is true I don&#39;t feel constrained having only one.\nI see very limited additional value of a method like that. But hey,\nthat is just me, I would certainly not suffer if it was there unless I\nwas in a project where someone used it in a place where\nStreams/Readers would be a better choice, which in my book is the\nmajority of situations.\n\n&gt;\n&gt;  Also, why do I have to write that loop every time? How often have you\n&gt;  wanted to read only one line from that BufferedReader? Where the hell is\n&gt;  BufferedReader.readLines() that returns an array or List of lines?!\n\nI have never (as far as I remember) wanted to read just one line from\nthe reader but I typically process them one at the time so I might\naswell do that /while/ reading from the stream rather than read all\nlines from the stream into memory and /then/ loop through the strings\nto process them one at the time.\n\nOf course sometimes I don&#39;t care about lines at all...\n\n&gt;  &gt; Of course, that is just one mans opinion that may change after working\n&gt;  &gt; with Ruby,\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;  That&#39;s always possible.\nIndeed\n\nCheers!\n/Joakim Ohlrogge\n\n",
