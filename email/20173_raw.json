In the olden days,\n&gt; &gt; with Eclipse 3.0 and JUnit 3.8, I could select a=\r\n single test\n&gt; &gt; method in the Outline view and run just that method.\n&gt; &gt; N=\r\nowadays, whenever I try to do that, Eclipse&#39;s test runner\n&gt; &gt; runs all the =\r\ntests in the class. The results are shown in a\n&gt; &gt; tree, and the tests I di=\r\ndn&#39;t ask to be run are all under a\n&gt; &gt; node called &quot;Unrooted Tests [Runner:=\r\n JUnit 4]&quot;.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; So, I figured there must be some simple explanation, an=\r\nd\n&gt; &gt; immediately did a Google search. And it found nothing on\n&gt; &gt; topic. S=\r\no I searched the Eclipse documentation and website\n&gt; &gt; for &quot;unrooted tests&quot;=\r\n and again got nothing. So I searched on\n&gt; &gt; this Yahoo Group&#39;s message arc=\r\nhive, and again found nothing.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Am I the only person in the world wh=\r\no has ever had this\n&gt; &gt; problem with running a single test method from Ecli=\r\npse? Or\n&gt; &gt; am I searching for the web&#39;s most suppressed secret?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; So=\r\nmeone please tell me you&#39;ve seen this problem too! And why\n&gt; &gt; is there not=\r\nhing written up about these mysterious &quot;Unrooted\n&gt; &gt; Tests&quot; in all the plac=\r\nes I looked?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Cheers,\n&gt; &gt; Todd.\n&gt; &gt; ----\n&gt; \n&gt; .\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; [N=\r\non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt;\n\n\n\n",
