I see this to be very critical for methods<br/>\nfailing and resulting in exceptions. this way user could simultaneously<br/>\nsay what is related message resulting failure along with the exact stack<br/>\ntrace.<br/>\nWhat would be the purpose? You get better information simply by letting<br/>\nthe original exception propagate. That is, by not intercepting it. If<br/>\nthe exception is a checked exception, simply add that exception type to<br/>\nthe test method&#39;s throws clause. In my opinion, more tests are crippled<br/>\nby trying to catch exceptions and &quot;re-throw&quot; them with fail() than by<br/>\nany other testing antipattern. The main, but not the only, legitimate<br/>\nuse of fail() is to cause test failure when you expected an exception to<br/>\nbe thrown but it was not. For example (JUnit 3):<br/>\npublic void testConnect_badURL() {<br/>\n     try {<br/>\n         service.setURL(&quot;https://bogus.site.danger.com&quot;);<br/>\n         service.connect();<br/>\n<br/>\n         fail(&quot;Should have thrown IOException&quot;);<br/>\n     } catch (java.io.IOException ioe) {<br/>\n         assertNotNull(ioe);<br/>\n         assertEquals(&quot;Unable to connect: https://bogus.site.danger.com&quot;,<br/>\n             ioe.getMessage());<br/>\n     }<br/>\n}<br/>\nIn the case where you are using what you expect is a good URL and it<br/>\nstill throws the bad URL exception, you should, instead 0f catching the<br/>\nexception and manufacturing a failure, just let it pass through and<br/>\ncause an error. For example:<br/>\npublic void testConnect_goodURL() throws java.io.IOException {<br/>\n     service.setURL(&quot;https://perfectly.legitimate.serviceURL.com&quot;);<br/>\n     HttpsURLConnection connection = (HttpsURLConnection)<br/>\nservice.connect();<br/>\n     assertNotNull(connection);<br/>\n}If the connect() method throws an exception here, this code gives you<br/>\nexactly what you are looking for, full exception message and stack trace<br/>\ndata, without resorting to try-catch and fail().<br/>\nAlso, junit does not give the count of no of test cases passed.. it says<br/>\ntotal, failed and errors only.. would be happy to see total passed and<br/>\nits % to encourage people to work on fixing others.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother need, which I had been badly looking for was no of asserts which<br/>\nhave been executed.. this tells me how much of auto testing has been<br/>\ndone.<br/>\n<br/>\ni.e assertEquals() assertNotNull all these calls should have a way<br/>\nreport to total assertcounter.<br/>\nI have no opinion on any of these. I don&#39;t need them, but I can<br/>\nunderstand why someone else might want them.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- Roger Glover<br/>\n     Object Partners, Inc.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed] </span></blockquote></div>",
