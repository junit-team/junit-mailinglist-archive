Code coverage analysis should be your guide in making \n    &gt; decisions about\n    &gt; whether testing through public APIs provide thorough \n    &gt; enough test coverage\n    &gt; (80%? 95%?, depending on the quality you&#39;re shooting for \n    &gt; and (relevant to\n    &gt; that) the industry you&#39;re in).  Naturally, coverage \n    &gt; analysis will inform\n    &gt; your testing decisions, which in turn will likely inform \n    &gt; your design\n    &gt; decisions.\n\nWell put!  This is something I have often alluded to in my own company, but\nstill eludes me frequently.  For that reason I wrote a utility that\nintegrates with VAJ to keep the metrics coming as far as what is tested and\nwhat is not.  This is not a code coverage analysis; all it does is report on\nwhich classes are tested and which are not, and of the ones that are - how\nmuch of their public interface is tested.\n\nThanks for the thoughts Scott.\n\n-Jason\n\n\n",
