There is a lot of information out there, and also a lot of<br/>\nfree and open code, but this data is not organized in the way Perl is,<br/>\nsuch as with the Perl CPAN, and as a result I am definitely getting<br/>\noverwhelmed and frustrated.  (Perhaps Larry Wall spoiled me.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI would be really grateful if anywone could point me to some excellent<br/>\n&quot;step by step&quot; information for getting started with Eclipse and JUnit.<br/>\n I should mention that I will be needing to work with the<br/>\nSpringFramework, and ultimately customizing the fancy new messaging<br/>\nsystems such as AMPQ.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs soon as I get &quot;turned around&quot; I will be documenting everything I am<br/>\ndoing probably on the Wikiversity site, which is a great place.<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you very much in advance, John<br/>\n<br/>\nPS, if you are interested in the business model I am working on/with<br/>\nand the group we are forming, and our philosophy, etc, etc, please ask.</div>",
