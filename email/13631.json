I am sure your code won&#39;t crash if the method<br/>\n&gt; is called without these prerequisites, it&#39;s just that it won&#39;t be doing<br/>\n&gt; anything useful (no-op or throwing an exception), so testing it in these<br/>\n&gt; conditions will be useless:  you need to set up these prerequisites before<br/>\n&gt; you invoke the method.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Properly designed public methods rarely have prerequisites. Exceptions <br/>\nare normally only used for exceptional conditions in the environment (in <br/>\nwhich case they&#39;re checked exceptions) or precondition violations (in <br/>\nwhich case they;re runtime exceptions).<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Seriously, can you take any two method invocations following each other in<br/>\n&gt; your code, swap them, and your code still works?!?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>The code still does something reasonable from the standpoint of the <br/>\nobject. Obviously the algorithm may be changed. For instance, I can call <br/>\ndrawLine before drawRect, in which case the rect is drawn on top of the <br/>\nline if they overlap, or I can call them in the reverse order in which <br/>\ncase the line is drawn on top. But from the perspective of a Graphics <br/>\nobject neither order is wrong.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe problem comes about when people design APIs that require something <br/>\nlike g.initializeContext(), g.setColor, and g.setFont before I&#39;m allowed <br/>\nto call g.drawLine. Any initialization that&#39;s necessary for an object to <br/>\nget into its correct state should be performed in the constructor.<br/>\n<br/>\nComplicated sequences of code execution are relics of procedural <br/>\nthinking. In object oriented programming we pass messages to objects. We <br/>\nmay send any message to any object at any time. Which messages we send <br/>\nwhen depends on what we want the objects to do. However, good objects <br/>\nbehave according to spec regardless of the order in which the methods <br/>\nare invoked. They do not say some method sequences are legal and some <br/>\nare illegal. This is because the classes and objects are the fundamental <br/>\nunits, not the functions and algorithms. This is the difference between <br/>\nobject oriented programming and procedural programming.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nElliotte Rusty Harold  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:elharo@...\">elharo@...</a><br/>\nXML in a Nutshell 3rd Edition Just Published!<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.cafeconleche.org/books/xian3/\">http://www.cafeconleche.org/books/xian3/</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0596007647/cafeaulaitA/ref=nosim\">http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0596007647/cafeaulaitA/ref=nosim</a></div>",
