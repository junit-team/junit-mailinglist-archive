My preferred solution is to design EJBs to be very thin layers <br/>\naround POJOs, so thin that the EJB (extending SessionBean, for example), <br/>\nonly does JNDI lookups and delegate to the resulting objects. No <br/>\ntestable logic at all.<br/>\n<br/>\nCould you do the same with your JNLP classes? I assume you need to hook <br/>\ninto the JNLP framework, either by extending classes or implementing <br/>\ninterfaces. Couldn&#39;t you make those extensions dumb delegaters to plain <br/>\nJava objects? Then you could test everything /except/ the JNLP wiring as <br/>\nnormal.<br/>\n<br/>\nMany people had trouble using this technique with EJB 2.0, because every <br/>\nexample they ever saw suggested they put all their logic directly into <br/>\ntheir session bean implementations--indeed, that was the point--so it <br/>\ntakes time to realize that this extra layer of indirection is worth the <br/>\neffort, and indeed in some cases, isn&#39;t worth the effort! Still, I think <br/>\nit&#39;s a technique you can try.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck.<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJ. B.
