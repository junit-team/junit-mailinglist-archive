That is why it remains a dream.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe dreams you mention here go *with* human nature -- namely the desire <br/>\nto explore -- and that helped make them happen.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; The point I&#39;m making is that if you do not have goals then you won&#39;t get the<br/>\n&gt; benefits of reaching<br/>\n&gt; even part of your goal.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote> From what I understand the goal of CMM is to define a process that even <br/>\na monkey could follow. Monkeys do not write software; people do.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Don&#39;t get me wrong. I have been on the butt end of an Enterprise CMM effort.<br/>\n&gt; It&#39;s mucho annoying,<br/>\n&gt; however, the underlying goal is still valid and drives toward better<br/>\n&gt; software.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It drives towards more uniform results, certainly; but I don&#39;t know <br/>\nabout &quot;better software&quot;.<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJ.
