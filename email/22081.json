Please allow me to<br/>\n&gt; illustrate my question with a simple example.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve got a class called Coordinate that represents a point in a 3D<br/>\n&gt; coordinate system. I&#39;ve overloaded the toString method of this class<br/>\n&gt; to write out the X, Y, and Z values of the coordinate in a simple<br/>\n&gt; String. Now I want to test my toString method using JUnit.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; If the Coordinate.toString test method fails (because the string was<br/>\n&gt; not constructed in the correct format) I would like to provide the<br/>\n&gt; programmer running the test with a copy of the incorrect string, since<br/>\n&gt; it provides valuable clues about what is broken with the method under<br/>\n&gt; test. I typically do this by placing System.err.println statements in<br/>\n&gt; my test method. However, I realize that using System.err.println isn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; the most portable or elegant way to provide this information to the<br/>\n&gt; programmer executing the test.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; What I really want is a GUI that allows the programmer to select a<br/>\n&gt; failed test from a list of failed tests, and then to view supplemental<br/>\n&gt; test data I provide him/her.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I was thinking I could do this by completing the following tasks:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; - Implementing the RunListener interface in JUnit.<br/>\n&gt; - Create an extension of Exception that could contain a HashMap of<br/>\n&gt; simple parameters and that would be passed to the constructor of a<br/>\n&gt; Failure object from within a test.<br/>\n&gt; - Creating Failure objects in my tests that contain the supplemental<br/>\n&gt; failrure data.<br/>\n&gt; - Passing these failure objects to my RunListener implementaiton.<br/>\n&gt; - Creating a FailureProcessor class that displays a GUI with the<br/>\n&gt; information in my RunListener implemenation to show the programmer<br/>\n&gt; executing my tests the supplemental failure data as described above.<br/>\n&gt; (FailureProcessor would be an interface so that you could do different<br/>\n&gt; things with the supplemental failure data, not just show it in a GUI.)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Before I begin this work, I wanted to ask if there was a better way to<br/>\n&gt; do this. I know I could use a logging framework from within my test<br/>\n&gt; method, but I really want to work within the JUnut framework, not<br/>\n&gt; outside of it. I also want a nice little GUI, not a log file.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; How are other programmers handling instances when they want to display<br/>\n&gt; supplemental data on failed tests? Does my approach sound reasonable?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The Sunburned Surveyor<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Yahoo!
