It runs as a servlet so it needs a servlet<br/>\nengine such as Tomcat, Orion or Weblogic to execute it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe latest version of JUnitEE that you can find in the CVS<br/>\ncontains also an option to print the tests executed.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou find JUnitEE on http:sourceforge.net/projects/junitee<br/>\n<br/>\nI think it does about what you request!<br/>\n<br/>\nregards<br/>\nKaarle Kaila<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In junit@y..., sramaswa007@y... wrote:<br/>\n&gt; Hi All,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   I am designing a project to run junit test cases from the <br/>\nbrowser.  <br/>\n&gt; Basically the user is given a form where in he types in the test <br/>\n&gt; class he wants to run and clicks the submit button. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The test case class is called and the results are returned back to <br/>\n&gt; the browser.  I am fine till that part as I am able to call the <br/>\n&gt; appropriate test case entered by the user and am able to display <br/>\nthe <br/>\n&gt; results on the browser.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; What I also need is that, is there a way to determine and print <br/>\nwhat <br/>\n&gt; test case methods are being run.  As in case of the swingui <br/>\n&gt; (junit.swingui.TestRunner) we have the progress bar indicator that <br/>\n&gt; tells us how many test cases are run, the failures and errors and <br/>\nthe <br/>\n&gt; stack trace.  Right now I am able to get all the results but once <br/>\nall <br/>\n&gt; the test cases have finished running, till then the page displayed <br/>\nto <br/>\n&gt; the user is blank.  Is there anyway to dynamically show which <br/>\nmethod <br/>\n&gt; in the test case is running and whether its a failure or error or <br/>\n&gt; success.  Please let me know.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Thanks,<br/>\n&gt; Sri </span></blockquote></div>",
