I have a question about how best to apply JUnit to<br/>\n  solve my particular testing need.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Basically I have a class (lets say Fruit.class) that is being mapped to<br/>\n  a database via an O/R  tool.  I would like to test this this mapping.<br/>\n  So I have a TestCase called FruitCRUDTestCase.  In my test case I have<br/>\n  test methods such as testCreate(), testRestore(), testUpdate(), and<br/>\n  testDelete().  Now, when writing these kind of tests before JUnit, I<br/>\n  could make the tests dependent on each other.  For example, if the<br/>\n  testCreate() method created an object, I could store a reference to it<br/>\n  in an instance attribute and access again from the other test methods<br/>\n  (testRestore() for example).  To my understanding, this does not seem to<br/>\n  be easily doable when using JUnit.  I can create a TestSuite that will<br/>\n  execute each of my test methods, I can even create an OrderedTestSuite<br/>\n  (from gsbase) that will execute my test methods in the order that I<br/>\n  specify, but each test method will be executed within its own instance<br/>\n  of TestCase so I can not use instance attributes to make data accessible<br/>\n  between test methods.  Is there something that I am missing?<br/>\n<br/>\n  Now I know that I can make the test methods completely independent to<br/>\n  get around this problem, but why?<br/>\n<br/>\n  I think because it fits the philosophy of writing many small independent<br/>\nunit tests methods. Each one showing a clear self-documenting simple<br/>\nexample.<br/>\n<br/>\n  The junit framework forces you into that way of working.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Later on, it makes refactoring more easy (no side effects, non unclear<br/>\ndependencies).<br/>\n<br/>\n  Making the test methods independent<br/>\n  would require duplicating effort since the testRestore() method would<br/>\n  have to create an object first (basically duplicate what is already<br/>\n  being done in testCreate()).<br/>\n<br/>\n  OK, but you can reduce the code effort by using static utilities<br/>\n  (see for example the article on the web about the &quot;ObjectMother pattern&quot;,<br/>\nThoughworks).<br/>\n<br/>\n  Maybe, it is not the fastest way in terms of performance, but you gain<br/>\nseveral<br/>\n  other advantages (flexibility, clarity, maintainability, pleasure,...).<br/>\n<br/>\n  Adelbert Groebbens<br/>\n<br/>\n  Basically I am looking for input before I write something myself. Maybe<br/>\n  someone has dealt with this problem before (I&#39;m sure some has -- it&#39;s<br/>\n  not that unique of a problem).  If so, please let me know how you&#39;ve<br/>\n  solved this.  I am willing to write a simple extension that will support<br/>\n  the type of behavior that I&#39;ve described, but maybe there is a better<br/>\n  way of doing things.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Thanks,<br/>\n<br/>\n  --Maciej<br/>\n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mbz@...\">mbz@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:<br/>\n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\">junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Your use of Yahoo!
