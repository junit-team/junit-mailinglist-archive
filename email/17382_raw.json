Or, that\n&gt;  &gt; is only a theoretical existence, since you can&#39;t know such code exists,\n&gt;  &gt; until you test it, even if only by using it.\n&gt; \n&gt; You can, because if it doesn&#39;t work, your users will let you know.\n\nMy point: that means you&#39;re forcing your users to test it, rather than \ntesting it yourself.\n\n&gt;  &gt; It&#39;s a fairly common occurrence, in my experience, and the reason behind\n&gt;  &gt; my\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; comments earlier: if other circumstances warrant it, it&#39;s okay to write\n&gt;  &gt; the\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; code, ship it and write the tests later.\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; If it doesn&#39;t have to work, that&#39;s fine.\n&gt; \n&gt; It does, otherwise the company will shut down.\n\nI can swing a dead cat and hit 10 companies that make money on software \nthat doesn&#39;t work.\n\nTo avoid this conversation looping endlessly, let me summarize my view:\n\n  * Not all software in use works\n  * There are many users that somewhat successfully use software that \ndoesn&#39;t work\n  * There are many companies that stay in business in spite of the fact \nthat the software they produce doesn&#39;t work\n  * Over several decades, we as an industry have trained users to be \nsatisfied with shit software, so when they get decent software (that is, \nnot tested, but works fairly well), they are delighted\n  * I think this state of affairs is holding us back from really doing \nGood Work with software\n  * A well-run business that produced great software could kill, \nespecially after Mr Gates exits from Microsoft (I couldn&#39;t resist that \nlast bit)\n  * Therefore, I do my part by trying to produce great software, instead \nof software that isn&#39;t quite shit; I try to surround myself with people \nwho can build a well-run business\n\nI hope that does it.\n-- \nJ.
