This code was originally developed to\nadd JUnit tests that used the real database code rather than trying to\nmock out all the dependencies in a large commercial enterprise product,\nIBM&#39;s WebSphere Product Center.\n\nLet&#39;s look at a simple example. Consider that you are writing a\nJUnit test for invoice functionality. Your invoice needs a product\nrecord in the database. So you simply put this line at the top of your\nJUnit test:\n\nProduct product = (Product) DOF.require(&quot;product.13.xml&quot;);\n\nWhat you have not done is pre-load the database with a SQL script. Your\ntest is just saying &quot;make sure that the product record 13 exists in\nthe database and give me that object. You know that the product record\nwill have other records that it depends on, but you only need to specify\nthat your test requires the product record. In fact, the file\n&quot;product.13.xml&quot; is used by another test, so you don&#39;t even\nneed to create it.\n\nCan it get any easier than this for specifying what your test needs on\ntop of an unpopulated database?\n\nThe DOF makes it easy to write tests with database dependencies.\nAdvantages include:\n1. Facilitation of testing legacy enterprise code lacking JUnit tests.\nWith the DOF, you do not need to untangle the database dependencies in\norder to write mock objects.\n2. Easy reuse of database objects needed for unit tests.\n3. Very simple to define which objects a test depends upon. Any indirect\ndependencies (dependencies of the dependencies) are specified in the\nfiles defining the dependent objects. Thus, a JUnit test can depend on\nobject A, and object A might depend on object C. The test simply needs\nto specify object A, and the definition file for object A will specify\nobject C.\n4. Very easy to delete persistent objects created for a test. When one\nis tweaking tests, this is very helpful.\n5. Very easy to add support for new database object types.\n\nSo how does this work?\n\n1. You define a data file format for your object type, such as XML.\n\n2. You write a &quot;handler&quot; class for this data file format. The\nhandler class implements an interface DependentObjectHandler composed of\n&quot;create(fileToLoad)&quot;, &quot;get(primaryKey)&quot;, and\n&quot;delete(primaryKey)&quot;\n\n3. You specify the mapping of the object types to the handlers, in a\nfile called handler_mappings.properties. For example, to specify that\nfiles named like product.13.xml map to the ProductXmlFactory class:\nproduct.xml=myPackage.ProductXmlFactory\n\n4. You create a data file for the object you want to create, named like\n{objectType}.{primaryKey}.{fileExtension} such as\n&quot;product.13.xml&quot;\n\n5. The data file contains comment lines indicating its dependencies. For\nexample, this line indicates that the product 13 depends on the\nmanufacturer 33 existing in the database.\n&lt;!-- $require(&quot;manufacturer.33.xml&quot;); --&gt;\n\nYou can download the framework including the JavaDoc and an example that\nuses simple XML and hsqldb here: http://sourceforge.net/projects/dof/\n&lt;http://sourceforge.net/projects/dof/&gt;\n\nPlease let me know if you find this useful and if you&#39;d like to\ncontribute. I&#39;m working on extending the example to support\nhibernate. I suspect that the project might not need to change for this\nsupport.\n\nI&#39;m presenting this material at SD West 2008 next month:\nhttps://www.cmpevents.com/SDw8/a.asp?option=G&V=3&id=558049\n&lt;https://www.cmpevents.com/SDw8/a.asp?option=G&V=3&id=558049&gt;\n\nCheers,\n\nJustin Gordon\n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n",
