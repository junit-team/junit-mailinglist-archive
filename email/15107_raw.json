Is this a=\r\n bad question entirely? I.e. Am I in a state of sin for\n&gt; &gt; wanting to swit=\r\nch around my unit tests from a command line?\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Possibly ;-), I&#39;ve never=\r\n felt the need to do it, but I&#39;ve been lucky\n&gt; enough\n&gt; to avoid a ball of =\r\nmud that big. I&#39;m fairly sure there are other ways,\n&gt; Data-Driven Tests wit=\r\nh a custom test suite might be a better option. I&#39;m\n&gt; sure Cedric can sugge=\r\nst how TestNG provides for this.\n\n\nSince you&#39;re asking :-)\n\nYes, being able=\r\n to switch the set of tests quickly without recompiling\nanything was one of=\r\n the design goals of TestNG. Groups make this very easy.\n\nFor example, you =\r\ncan invoke TestNG like this:\n\njava org.testng.TestNG -includegroups databas=\r\ne\n\nor\n\njava org.testng.TestNG -includegroups web\n\nSome of our users have mo=\r\nre complex ways to select test methods, and\ntypically, they use\n\n- Either d=\r\nifferent testng.xml files (testng-quick.xml, testng-nightly.xml,\netc...)\n\n-=\r\n Or BeanShell to select methods being run in more complex cases (&quot;run group=\r\n\n&#39;weekend&#39; during the weekend and group &#39;weekly&#39; during the week)\n\n 2. Is t=\r\nhere a good way to test SWT?\n\n\nYes, Eclipse is automatically tested this wa=\r\ny. A couple of Eclipse books\ncover this and you can find more information o=\r\nn http://eclipse.org (I\nrealize you asked for SWT testing, but testing Ecli=\r\npse is even more complex,\nso testing SWT should be easier).\n\n\nGoogle so far=\r\n says &#39;not really&#39;. I&#39;ve made some painful conclusions and\n&gt; &gt; design decis=\r\nions from this. Chief among them has been, &quot;if you need to\n&gt; &gt; test the UI,=\r\n you&#39;ve probably got model code in your view classes. Fix\n&gt; &gt; that first.&quot;\n=\r\n\n\nSure, but you need to test the UI too. Just because your model works does=\r\nn&#39;t\nmean that the UI does.\n\n\n--\nC=E9dric\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this messa=\r\nge have been removed]\n\n\n",
