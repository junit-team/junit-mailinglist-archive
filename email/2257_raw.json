Akinlaja&quot; &lt;joa@...&gt;\r\n\r\nHi Mike,\n\n&gt; In my opinion, developers should not write the web page navigation\n&gt; and contents tests.  This is not unit testing.  This is functional\n&gt; testing that should be done by the QA team.  Although I admit the\n&gt; line between unit and functional testing is sometimes blurry.\n\n    But in the situation described by Paul, there is no QA Staff available\nto do so. Do I get it right that in your opinion in such a situations there\nis no need for functional testing?\n\n&gt; With Front Controller you can gut all of your business logic out of\n&gt; your servlets and JSPs.  Your business logic would be contained in\n&gt; separate classes which can be unit tested.\n&gt; Mike\n&gt;\n\n    IMHO, even if I am going the model 2 way and my business logic layer is\ndoing fine, the presentation layer can break and bugs in the integration are\nrather likely to be coded.\n\n    IMHO, you should do functional testing. Yes, I had the same problem with\nHttpUnit when using it for unit tests. But for functional testing I believe\nit to be a great help and a wonderful tool (Thank you Russel Gold et al.).\nKeeping the functional tests up with other tools (even with graphical tools\nfor none programmers) will also be a pain, if design changes very rapidly.\n\n    IMHO, if  QA staff cannot write the functional tests, it will at least\nbe in the position to describe the functional tests. Thus if I am up to\nintegrating my stuff - I tend to think of writing the controler of model 2\nas integration - I write down the stories related to my integration. If\nthese functional tests go fine, I am done with integrating. If the design is\nabout to change in a way, that it will affect my test code, I tell\nmanagement about this. No one ever stated, that changes in requirements or\ndesign come for free. Thus I do testing with HttpUnit, but on functional\nlevel and not unit level. And using it this way, the pain my collegues and I\nhad with keeping the tests up is quite okay. And if you are straight with\nmanagement about the costs of change, unnecessary changes in design (the\ntypical: &quot;Oh, let&#39;s do that, because at the time I, the manager or marketing\nperson, believe it to be cool.&quot;) are not very likely.\n\nToyin\n\n\n",
