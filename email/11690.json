That was still more than 75 tests, which<br/>\nhad potential interactions with each other. It&#39;s much easier to rollback<br/>\ntransactions than, when a test fails, to reload a database and run an<br/>\nindividual test against it just to see if it was a real failure or an<br/>\ninteraction.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; And I disagree: you /can/ get rid of all the tests against the database<br/>\n&gt; for a given application, as long as you move the database integration to<br/>\n&gt; a separate project, write it once, and use it throughout the enterprise.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Well, that might work for you, but the freezing of that part of the<br/>\nsystem and loss of ability to refactor would kill me. I don&#39;t see a<br/>\ndatabase table definition as any different from code to generate an HTML<br/>\nform; it&#39;s all part of the application, and it all changes and moves<br/>\naround as necessary. This means I not infrequently move code from the<br/>\ndatabase to Java or vice versa, just as I would move code from one class<br/>\nto another.<br/>\n<br/>\ncjs<br/>\n-- <br/>\nCurt Sampson  &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:cjs@...\">cjs@...</a>&gt;   +81 90 7737 2974   <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.NetBSD.org\">http://www.NetBSD.org</a><br/>\n    Don&#39;t you know, in this new Dark Age, we&#39;re all light.  --XTC</div>",
