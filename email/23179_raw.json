However, since a=\r\n Rule does not seem to work with a Suite (and therefore Categories), I beli=\r\neve that would require a common base-class for all my tests, which is somet=\r\nhing I&#39;m trying to avoid.\n\nIt seems if I could access the JUnit objects dir=\r\nectly-- either via a singleton/static API, or via fetching annotation objec=\r\nts, I could fetch my category, find its list of test classes, and iterate o=\r\nver them verifying the annotations.\n\nHas anyone tackled this before?  Any i=\r\ndeas?\n\nThanks\n-Steve\n\n\n",
