It is very widely supported by many frameworks <br/>\nthat leverage it.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor example, for Spring applications, there&#39;s the Spring Test Framework <br/>\nwhich is part of the Spring Framework, and also Unitils, which supports <br/>\nSpring, mocking and databases - see <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unitils.org/\">http://www.unitils.org/</a><br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, for your application, you&#39;re looking for something that is <br/>\ntuned towards automating UI tests. Selenium is probably the most widely <br/>\nused.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe find Selenium to be very easy to create modular and powerful tests <br/>\nsuites. We run it from within JUnit.<br/>\n<br/>\nRegards,<br/>\n<br/>\nNeale<br/>\n<br/>\nNeale Upstone<br/>\nOpen Credo Ltd – Excellence in Enterprise Software Development<br/>\nCertified SpringSource Delivery Partner<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On 16/03/2011 06:26, jyotirmoy wrote:<br/>\n&gt; Hi Seniors,<br/>\n&gt;   I am a newbie in using Junit. Please let me know if JUnit will be<br/>\n&gt; good enough for web application  testing(server code in java). Is it<br/>\n&gt; true that &quot;The JUnit code will be complex and hard to maintain. You<br/>\n&gt; will have to reproduce all of the interactions between code and user<br/>\n&gt; within the Junit test, which very quickly becomes complex. If all you<br/>\n&gt; are doing is testing one single entry point, then this could well<br/>\n&gt; work, but if you are testing multiple screens (a wizard or something<br/>\n&gt; like that), then it can quickly become fragile and unmanageable.&quot;?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I will be moving to watij if Junit is not good enough for web app<br/>\n&gt; testing.
