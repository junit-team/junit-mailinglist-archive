It seems to me that you can do this \n&gt; kind of\n&gt; validation in a @BeforeClass in JUnit 4. Would that solve your problem?\n\nNot so easily in this case.  This is a validation that is run before any \nother test in the AllTests suite, if it fails no other test is run.  You \nget a single failure, fix the web.xml file and then run again.  In order \nto get this same behavior in JUnit4 I would have to duplicate the \n@BeforeClass and @AfterClass annotations into every TestCase.  \nAnnotations in this sense are really starting to sound like Advices in \nthe AOP world.\n\nSimilarly, we have functional tests that use a type of validation like \nthe one I mentioned before that connect to a third party WebService and \ngrab its WSDL (Salesforce.com).  The validation checks the WSDL in the \nservice against the WSDL we have saved locally.  If they don&#39;t match we \nknow that we need to regenerate classes from the WSDL.  Since the \nobjects we are currently working with are now &quot;out of date&quot; running the \ntests don&#39;t make too much sense, so we throw a failure and refuse to run \nany other tests.  The developer at that point copies the new WSDL to \nhis/her local directory, regenerates classes, and runs tests again.  \nThis is especially important at check-in time so that we know that the \nHEAD of our CVS branch is generally in line with the WebService -- \nallowing us to make a build out of HEAD at any time.\n\nAs I said earlier the @BeforeClass and @AfterClass are too limited in \ntheir scope to allow for such validations.  Please correct me if I am wrong.\n\n-- \nJason Rogers\n\n&quot;I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I,\nbut Christ liveth in me: and the life which I now live in \nthe flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved \nme, and gave himself for me.&quot;\n    Galatians 2:20\n\n\n",
