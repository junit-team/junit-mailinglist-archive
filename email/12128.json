Does anyone have any book recommendations to help with industry accepted terms and definitions? I have seen references to &quot;The Art of Software Testing&quot; by Glenford Myers that describe it as the seminal work on the matter. Is that book worth getting? Is there a website anywhere that has &quot;standard&quot; definitions that my co-workers and I can use for enlightenment on this matter?<br/>\n<br/>\nAll wisdom on this matter will be greatly appreciated.<br/>\n<br/>\nSimon<br/>\n<br/>\n-----------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nSimon P.
