It strikes me as<br/>\nsomething that could be done with a custom runner, without patching<br/>\nJUnit: have you found that to be true?<br/>\n<br/>\n2) I&#39;ve heard of wanting to only instantiate a test class once (you<br/>\ncan do that in JUnit, see<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/junit/message/19159)\">http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/junit/message/19159)</a>.  Is that what<br/>\nyou&#39;re looking for, or is there another advantage in having non-static<br/>\n@BeforeClass, etc?<br/>\n<br/>\n3) As I understand it, dependsOnMethods allows one test method to be<br/>\nskipped if another one fails.  I had a version of this in my own JUnit<br/>\nsandbox for a while, and found it not as useful as I&#39;d liked.  If used<br/>\nto truly say &quot;this test, valid on its own, will fail if this other<br/>\ntest, valid on its own, fails&quot;, I found that the dependencies became<br/>\nstale, and tests ended up skipped that I wanted to run.  However,<br/>\nthere were two situations in which it was useful:<br/>\n<br/>\na) In some other cases, I found I was using the method dependency as a<br/>\nway of specifying preconditions for a test case.  This meant that I<br/>\nneeded a test that stated, for example, whether the test database was<br/>\nup, or whether I was connected to the Internet, or whether I felt like<br/>\nclicking on some buttons to help test the UI.  In JUnit 4.4, these<br/>\nkinds of dependencies are now marked by assumptions:<br/>\n<br/>\n@Test public void parseGoogleCorrectly() {<br/>\n   assumeTrue(internetConnected());<br/>\n  //...<br/>\n}<br/>\n<br/>\nI might decide that if the internet is not connected, my tests should<br/>\nfail, in which case I can test the condition directly:<br/>\n<br/>\n@Test public void internetShouldBeConnected() {<br/>\n  assertTrue(internetConnected());<br/>\n}<br/>\n<br/>\nb) Dependencies between tests can be useful in initial TDD<br/>\ndevelopment: I write a test A, and find out that I&#39;ve bitten off more<br/>\nthan I can chew.  I write a test B for a smaller chunk of<br/>\nfunctionality, and make A dependent on B, so that I can ignore A until<br/>\nB passes.  However, I found that these dependencies cluttered the<br/>\ncode, and weren&#39;t much help once initial development was done.  I<br/>\nactually made the dependency method deprecated, so that I remembered<br/>\nto remove the dependencies once everything was working.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy guess is that using assumptions will handle most reasons that<br/>\npeople use dependsOnMethod.  If you do find the temporary dependency<br/>\nscaffolding from 3b interesting, let&#39;s talk more about it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\n<br/>\n   David Saff<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On 8/16/07, Roger Chen @ RevZoom &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:coderobochen@...\">coderobochen@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; Hi -<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Is there any plan in the near future to support some TestNG features like:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 1) Ability to re-run only the failed tests by storing the list of<br/>\n&gt; failed tests persistently in an XML file etc. I have thought through a<br/>\n&gt; patch to Junit to address this.
