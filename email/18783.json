And a T3 manager is not going to provide an environment where<br/>\n&gt;  the T2 (the ones that require some time and encouragement) can become<br/>\n&gt;  test infected.   And this might explain why developer testing is still<br/>\n&gt;  practiced by a minority of developers in a minority of organizations.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  Feedback?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>What I have seen more is that these developers become &quot;architects&quot;<br/>\nwhom design systems in such a manner that it makes it extremely<br/>\ndifficult for the T1 developer to begin developer testing.  The T1<br/>\ndeveloper is not allowed to refactor the &quot;architecture&quot; to aid testing<br/>\nand so to implement testing is actually very hard work and you end up<br/>\nbeing the only one who cares.  It&#39;s very frustrating.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers<br/>\nShane</div>",
