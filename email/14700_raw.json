Sounds like you have your &quot;Designer&quot; hat on. That wasn&#39;t what I\n&gt; &gt; understood to be the context of the question. &quot;How do I test a private\n&gt; &gt; method&quot; is a question someone wearing their &quot;Tester&quot; hat would ask.\n&gt; &gt; Given that context, my mind hasn&#39;t changed. If the private method is\n&gt; &gt; already tested through an existing public method then you don&#39;t need\n&gt; &gt; to do anything. In fact, exposing the method and writing an explicit\n&gt; &gt; test against it is duplication.\n&gt; \n&gt; Is it really?\n&gt; \n&gt; First: the question &quot;How do I test this private method&quot; is a trigger\n&gt; to me to swap out to my Designer hat - it means that there&#39;s an\n&gt; abstraction that&#39;s worth taking out.\n&gt; \n&gt; Second: if it&#39;s already tested _enough_, then there is no need to test\n&gt; it, is there? But I don&#39;t know why I would ask that question if it&#39;s\n&gt; already tested enough.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thirdly: if it&#39;s not tested enough, then exposing the method and\n&gt; writing new tests is not duplication - in fact, it can significantly\n&gt; reduce duplication by removing the need to duplicate extraneous setup\n&gt; work.\n\n1) &quot;How do I test this private method&quot; sounds more like a question\nasked by someone practicing test-after development. If so, you may be\nright because the entire design is now suspect. \n\n2) Exactly. Thank you!\n\n3) I disagree. It&#39;s a symptom that TDD discipline is breaking down.\nCode has been written before a test that needed it. Now&#39;s the time to\nback away from the current implementation, write the test you /really/\nwant, and then get to green. \n\nRegards,\nJim\n\n\n\n",
