I<br/>\nsuppose I&#39;ll have to go find  a Maven plugin for other types of tests as<br/>\nwell now :)<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m also beginning to think that integration testing is of great importance,<br/>\nespecially since my projects are getting quite complicated (simulated<br/>\ncompilers and such for University). Thus my interest. I think I&#39;ll<br/>\ndefinitely check out the relative merits of trying first a simple JUnit<br/>\napproach to intergration testing and then trying the TestNG route.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for the tips regarding User Acceptance testing. I was pretty sure<br/>\nJUnit isn&#39;t the right approach here. I&#39;ll check out those tools, since I<br/>\nconcur about readability - especially for agile shops.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for getting the &#39;feel&#39; of TDD, I know exactly what you mean. I&#39;ve learned<br/>\na lot over the past year or so of using it, and it&#39;s sped up my development<br/>\nefforts greatly.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks again,<br/>\nJan.<br/>\n<br/>\n2008/9/2 Dennis Lloyd Jr &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dennislloydjr@...\">dennislloydjr@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;   Hi Jan,<br/>\n&gt; I won&#39;t claim to be the official position of the JUnit community, but I<br/>\n&gt; will<br/>\n&gt; offer my thoughts.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; It is okay to use JUnit for other kinds of testing, however I avoid putting<br/>\n&gt; my unit tests and integration or system tests in the same source folders.<br/>\n&gt; The reason for this is, I&#39;d rather be able to run my unit tests very<br/>\n&gt; frequently and therefore they need to be very fast. Separating them allows<br/>\n&gt; me to pick what to run.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Honestly, I&#39;ve been giving some thought to the concept of integration<br/>\n&gt; testing and wondering myself where it fits in (after some thought-provoking<br/>\n&gt; comments from Joe Rainsberger). Right now my thinking is that it is a<br/>\n&gt; valuable testing practice to do white-box integration testing and<br/>\n&gt; automating<br/>\n&gt; those tests using a tool such as JUnit is probably a good idea. However,<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; not sure that TDD integration testing is the right thing - anyone else have<br/>\n&gt; thoughts on this? (Maybe I should start another thread...)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; As for user acceptance tests, I try not to do these in JUnit at all. The<br/>\n&gt; reason is, I want the user to be able to read them. Therefore, I use tools<br/>\n&gt; such as Fitnesse, and now I&#39;m trying out Concordian.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Ultimately you&#39;ll need to find what works for you and your team, and you&#39;ll<br/>\n&gt; probably change your strategy several times as you learn the &#39;feel&#39; of TDD.<br/>\n&gt; It takes some time to learn, but has been the most valuable practice I&#39;ve<br/>\n&gt; found in software design. Welcome to TDD.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hope this helps!<br/>\n&gt; -Dennis<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; On 9/2/08, Jan Kroeze &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:thejcwk@...\">thejcwk@...</a> &lt;thejcwk%40gmail.com&gt;&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Hi all!<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m a bit of a newb to the whole TDD thing, but I understand that unit<br/>\n&gt; &gt; tests<br/>\n&gt; &gt; are supposed to be blazingly fast and not access the hard drive, network,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; database or anything external to the code itself. To this end, I<br/>\n&gt; understand<br/>\n&gt; &gt; that a framework such as jMock can be used.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; So far, so good. But I find JUnit to be extremely useful for writing<br/>\n&gt; &gt; integration, system and user acceptance tests as well.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Here&#39;s my question: what is the official position of the JUnit community<br/>\n&gt; on<br/>\n&gt; &gt; using JUnit to do larger scale tests? Is there a better framework, or is<br/>\n&gt; it<br/>\n&gt; &gt; common practice to use JUnit for these tests as well?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; --<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Jan Kroeze<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>-- <br/>\nJan Kroeze<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",
