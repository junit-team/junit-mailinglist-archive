This needs to be initiated before some other things can<br/>\nhappen.<br/>\nWe don&#39;t currently have a Rules problem here, but I can imaging, that<br/>\nsuch a quirky design can lead to such problems. And then a workaround<br/>\nmight be helpful.<br/>\n(Yes, this really is a design flaw in the application and we are<br/>\nworking on fixing it soon.)<br/>\n<br/>\nGreetings,<br/>\n   Malte</div>",
