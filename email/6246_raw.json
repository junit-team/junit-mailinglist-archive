We have one class we call that returns=\r\n a \n&gt; database connection, so we added a method to that class to allow us \n=\r\n&gt; to say &quot;Hey, here&#39;s a mock object for this data source.  When someone \n&gt; =\r\nrequests a connection to this database, give them this mock object \n&gt; inste=\r\nad of a real connection.&quot;  This let&#39;s us mix mock objects and \n&gt; real conne=\r\nction.  For example, we have one database that is ours, and \n&gt; we have a te=\r\nst replica in-house.  Several other databases we deal \n&gt; with are outside o=\r\nur realm.  So, if need be, we could still hit our \n&gt; database and mock out =\r\nall of the other ones.\n\nAha... I like that. You have to create the mock obj=\r\nect in\nthe test case (or it&#39;s setUp()), so what you do is to hand\nthat mock=\r\n object off to the factory class. This is how the\nfactory knows to hand out=\r\n a mock instead of a real connection.\nNice. I think I&#39;d ALSO have the facto=\r\nry check an environment\nvariable (so I can report things like asking for 2 =\r\nconnections\nwhen it was only supposed to ask for one), but this is a\ngood a=\r\npproach.\n\n-- Michael Chermside\n\n\n",
