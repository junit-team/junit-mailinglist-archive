Unit testing\ncan be viewed as virtually free.\n5) The tests live on long after developers have left the project.\n\nHere are some reasons to use JUnit:\n1) It&#39;s a true testing framework that can be extended.  Why write your own?\n2) The tests are easily automatable from a build script since they are\nconsistently written.\n3) There are no external &quot;data&quot; or input files to get lost, as there may be\nin main() type tests.\n4) There is no output to look through since conditions are asserted in the\ncode.\n5) A test skeleton can be built by some of the IDE&#39;s out there today.\n6) Since there are no parameters to most JUnit tests there is really no\nexternal documentation necessary.\n7) Mention the word JUnit and anyone familiar with it can be up to speed\nquickly with any tests written in it.\n8) It&#39;s idiot proof; it either passes or fails.\n9) Most programmers aren&#39;t &quot;proud&quot; enough of their tests, or aren&#39;t willing\nto admit they have very few tests, so no tests are checked into a source\ncode repository.  This is certainly not the case with JUnit.\n\nBrian Peterson\nwww.thomson.com\n\n\nThe opinions expressed herein are at best coincidentally related to\nthose of any past, present, or future employer.\n\n\n&gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; From: Mike Clark [mailto:mike@...]\n&gt; Sent: Wednesday, April 02, 2003 9:00 AM\n&gt; To: junit@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Subject: Re: [junit] How do I make Unit Testing practical?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Scott Palmer wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;Another comment:\n&gt; &gt;I&#39;ve been trying to get started with the unit testing and have been \n&gt; &gt;encouraging other&#39;s in my company to try it too, but I can&#39;t get any \n&gt; &gt;buy-in. I&#39;m finding it difficult to get started so I don&#39;t \n&gt; really have \n&gt; &gt;a convincing argument for it other than &quot;I&#39;ve read that it \n&gt; is a great \n&gt; &gt;thing&quot; :), obviously if I can make it work for me it would \n&gt; help.   It&#39;s \n&gt; &gt;good to hear that others have had the same issues and have \n&gt; gotten past \n&gt; &gt;them.
