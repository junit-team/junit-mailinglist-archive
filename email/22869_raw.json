They have to manually sele=\r\nct to use the new version that has just appeared in the repo, and this way =\r\nif their tests start failing, they will know that they can either fix them =\r\nto work with the new version of junit, or revert to the previous version.\n\n=\r\nI am considering of taking up on this task with pushing junit to the public=\r\n Maven repo, but I have to first learn what is exactly the process for this=\r\n (perhaps signing up at Apache as contributor, or smt).\n\nBogdan\n\n--- In jun=\r\nit@yahoogroups.com, David Saff &lt;david@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; On Tue, Aug 17, 2010 =\r\nat 6:28 PM, pniederw &lt;pniederw@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;ve noticed that JUnit incl=\r\nudes an (outdated) version of Hamcrest. Will future JUnit version continue =\r\nto ship with Hamcrest?\n&gt; \n&gt; Yes, having made this decision, we&#39;ll stick to =\r\nit until convinced it&#39;s\n&gt; doing more harm than good.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Do you have pla=\r\nns to update to Hamcrest 1.2 or higher?\n&gt; \n&gt; Unfortunately, the last time w=\r\ne looked at the typing changes in\n&gt; Hamcrest 1.2, we found that we couldn&#39;t=\r\n automatically upgrade people\n&gt; without changing compiling tests into non-c=\r\nompiling tests, and, if I\n&gt; remember, in a few pathological cases, passing =\r\ntests into failing\n&gt; tests.  We guessed that of people who used the hamcres=\r\nt features\n&gt; bundled with JUnit, there were more that would be hurt by a ve=\r\nrsion\n&gt; change than would be helped by it, so we&#39;ve stayed here.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Why=\r\n is there no junit-dep anymore, i.e. how are we supposed to use JUnit with =\r\nHamcrest 1.2?\n&gt; \n&gt; junit-dep has been up on github for every release.  Whoe=\r\nver has been\n&gt; putting JUnit up on maven, I take it, hasn&#39;t been also putti=\r\nng up\n&gt; junit-dep?  I&#39;m sorry to say that I&#39;m very aware that a lot of peop=\r\nle\n&gt; are indebted to the anonymous time-donor who&#39;d been keeping the maven\n=\r\n&gt; repos up-to-date until several months ago.  I&#39;ve been reluctant to\n&gt; acce=\r\npt full responsibility for feeding a repository I neither use nor\n&gt; fully u=\r\nnderstand until some point where I was sure I could quickly\n&gt; respond to mi=\r\nllions of users who got their junit jars auto-updated in\n&gt; a way that broke=\r\n all their tests.  This might be overly cautious of\n&gt; me.\n&gt; \n&gt;    David Saf=\r\nf\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Cheers,\n&gt; &gt; Peter\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ----------------------------=\r\n--------\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Yahoo!
