    "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-207614126\">I&#39;ve worked with jCoverage and Cobertura for the past several months. <br/>\nHowever, I&#39;d like to find a tool that will display, for each line of the <br/>\nclass under test, which unit tests actually executed that line. Simply <br/>\nstating that X line was executed Y times is of marginal use to me if I <br/>\ncan&#39;t map back to see exactly /how/ that line was executed. I don&#39;t <br/>\nrecall whether EMMA does this. Any other suggestions? Commercial version <br/>\nof jCoverage?<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy do I need this? At first, I created a custom Javadoc taglet that <br/>\ndevelopers would add to their class-under-test&#39;s method comments, to the <br/>\ntune of:<br/>\n<br/>\n   /**<br/>\n    * @... = FooTest#testAddBar()<br/>\n    * @... = FooTest#testAddThreeBars()<br/>\n    */<br/>\n   public void addBar(Bar bar) { ... }<br/>\n<br/>\nThis would insert appropriate Javadoc links to the relevant test <br/>\nmethods. But this is unwieldy, and certainly an unrealistic requirement <br/>\nfor the developers.</div>",
