Error, warning, and debug\nstatements used to communicate to the user of production software\nshould not in general be replaced.\n\n  In the example below, I&#39;d first change the loadDriver method to throw\nthe ClassNotFoundException.  Then I&#39;d write a test method that\nexercises the loadDriver() method and verify that the test fails when\nthe ClassNotFoundException is thrown.\n\nMike\n\n--- Andrew Wilkie &lt;andrew.wilkie@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; Hi Group,\n&gt; \n&gt; Just started to use JUnit on my first Java project at work. Got it\n&gt; setup and outputting into message view of JBuilder.\n&gt; \n&gt; All the articles I read say to replace any System.out.println() calls\n&gt; with test cases. I am unable to get this to work when\n&gt; the System.out.println() is contained within the Catch statement of a\n&gt; Try/Catch block.\n&gt; \n&gt; In the code below, this is the line &quot;System.out.println(&quot;Unable to\n&gt; load Driver Class&quot;);&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; ===================================================\n&gt; package testjdbc;\n&gt; \n&gt; import java.sql.*;\n&gt; \n&gt; public class JDBCSample\n&gt; {\n&gt;   public JDBCSample()\n&gt;   {\n&gt;   }\n&gt; \n&gt;   public boolean loadDriver()\n&gt;   {\n&gt;     try\n&gt;     {\n&gt;       // This is where we load the driver by calling in a class\n&gt; through its\n&gt;       // string name using the forName method.\n&gt;       Class.forName(&quot;oracle.jdbc.driver.OracleDriver&quot;);\n&gt;     }\n&gt;     catch (ClassNotFoundException e)\n&gt;     {\n&gt;        System.out.println(&quot;Unable to load Driver Class&quot;);\n&gt;     }\n&gt;   }\n&gt; }\n&gt; ===================================================\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m sure there is a simple explanation to this, but I am unable to\n&gt; work it out.\n&gt; \n&gt; Any help is greatlly appreciated.\n&gt; \n&gt; Cheers,\n&gt; Andrew\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --\n&gt; \n&gt; This e-mail may contain confidential and/or privileged information.\n&gt; If you are not the intended recipient (or have received this e-mail\n&gt; in error) please notify the sender immediately and destroy this\n&gt; e-mail.
