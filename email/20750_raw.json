That is you\n&gt; &gt; want to do your-one-time-setup, run class =\r\nA, run class B, and to do\n&gt; &gt; your-one-time-teardown. How can you do it?\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; @RunWith(Suite.class)\n&gt; @SuiteClasses(A.class, B.class)\n&gt; public class M=\r\nySuite {\n&gt;   @BeforeClass public static void doYourOneTimeSetup() {}\n&gt;   @A=\r\nfterClass public static void doYourOneTimeTeardown() {}\n&gt; }\nFirst of all, I=\r\n happy to know about this way of testing. Does it\navailable in JUnit 4.4? (=\r\nI don&#39;t have the code to look on it right now)\nActually it is not very conv=\r\nenient method to do it. For example, I\nwant to run JBoss microcontainer in =\r\ndoYourOneTimeSetup(), so I want to\ndo it for ANY suite that I will run and =\r\nthey very. I want to test some\naspect of the system, and afterwards, anothe=\r\nr aspect and so on. This\nwill force me to change this class every time. See=\r\n also next point.\n\n&gt; &gt; Morevoer, suppose, you want to run only some specifi=\r\nc methods from\n&gt; &gt; those classes, not all the methods, how can you do it\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; This isn&#39;t probably easy enough yet, but still possible.  Are you\n&gt; hopi=\r\nng to specify the methods in a Java file, on the command line, or\n&gt; some ot=\r\nher way?\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; In JUnit 3.8.x\n&gt; &gt; there was a way to do it.\n&gt; \n&gt; What was =\r\nyour favorite?\n\npublic static Test suite() {\n\nTestSuite suite=3D new TestSu=\r\nite();\n\nsuite.addTest(MoneyTest.class, &quot;fooName&quot;);\n\nreturn suite;\n}\n\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; --- In junit@yahoogroups.com, &quot;David Saff&quot; &lt;david@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; @=\r\nBeforeClass and @AfterClass on the @RunWith(Suite) class have\nexactly\n&gt; &gt;&gt; =\r\nthis behavior in JUnit 4.4 and beyond.
