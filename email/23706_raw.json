Before I begin writing the tests I have been workin=\r\ng (frustratingly) on this particular Jira issue [1]. In summary, the issue =\r\nattempts to add the functionality to a script [2] that will enable us to te=\r\nst individual test cases from the command line rather than have to run ever=\r\ny JUnit test case when we wish to review changes or review performance of n=\r\new test cases. I am however not getting very far with setting the correct e=\r\nnvironment variable and could do with some guidance. The patch which I&#39;m tr=\r\nying to apply would allow us to run \n\nbin/nutch junit org.apache.nutch.test=\r\nCase\n\nThis would then run the specified test case class. I&#39;m positive that =\r\nmy problem is the export classpath environment variable which should point =\r\nto the test case directory. I&#39;m just not able to add the class  paths, ther=\r\nefore I get an exception and stack trace error (NoClassDef) whenever I try =\r\nto run a test case. \n\nFinally, just to clarify, I&#39;m using the TestRunner cl=\r\nass to run the tests.\n\nAny help, guidance etc would be greatly appreciated =\r\nas it will enable me to progress with writing and fixing some 20-30 test cl=\r\nasses. If I can provide any more information please advise.\n\nThank you in a=\r\ndvance\n\nLewis    \n\n[1] https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NUTCH-672\n[2] =\r\nhttps://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/nutch/trunk/src/bin/nutch\n\n\n",
