In the case of pre/postconditions or invariants, each of<br/>\nthese will be fairly unique to the method they apply to, so there is little<br/>\nreuse going on, and therefore, little point in capturing them in aspects<br/>\n(which this tool doesn&#39;t seem to do, by the way, since they are captured in<br/>\na string).<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nCedric<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On 9/4/06, Cédric Beust ♔ &lt;cbeust@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; On 9/4/06, Ray V &lt;ttftestrayv@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I wonder what you guys think of Contract4J:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; http://www.contract4j.org/contract4j&lt;http://www.google.com/url?sa=D&q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.contract4j.org%2Fcontract4j&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; It combines an annotation based design by contract<br/>\n&gt; &gt; approach with the &quot;fail fast&quot; philosophy, and can be<br/>\n&gt; &gt; turned off (like assertions) when it&#39;s time to deploy.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; It seems very complimentary to unit testing, and would<br/>\n&gt; &gt; help in doing less defensive programming.  I&#39;ve been<br/>\n&gt; &gt; curious about this tool for a while, but have yet to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; use it myself on a real project.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Based on the example on the Web site, it seems to me it&#39;s the wrong way to<br/>\n&gt; solve the problem.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The example is basically moving asserts inside the method into a string<br/>\n&gt; inside an annotation.  By doing that, you lose type checking, you lose IDE<br/>\n&gt; assistance, you lose highlighting and you lose refactoring capabilities.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I also wonder how well it scales when your preconditions or postconditions<br/>\n&gt; need to span ten lines, or when you want to intersperse them in-between<br/>\n&gt; several lines inside your method.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; These reasons are exactly why I think Design by Contract simply doesn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; work:  either your DBC tests are small enough to fit in one-line assertions<br/>\n&gt; (which can be optimized away by the compiler) or they are fairly complex and<br/>\n&gt; better captured in tests.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --<br/>\n&gt; Cédric<br/>\n&gt; http://testng.org&lt;http://www.google.com/url?sa=D&q=http%3A%2F%2Ftestng.org&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nCédric<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed] </span></blockquote></div>",
