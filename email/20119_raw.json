I use a mix of Maven 1, Ant and shell scripts for builds, and  \n&gt; some people here prefer to write code in IntelliJ or even vim. My  \n&gt; suggestion would be an external file, crap4j.config perhaps, in the  \n&gt; classpath somewhere, and have it contain entries like:\n&gt;\n&gt; Ignore:\n&gt; com.pjacobsson.crap.*\n&gt; com.pjacobsson.SomeClass\n&gt; com.pjacobsson.SomeOtherClass.crappyMethod\n&gt;\n&gt; An @Ignore annotation on class or method level could be a nice  \n&gt; addition for some cases, but it should be optional. I&#39;d prefer to  \n&gt; not have dependencies from the code to tools like crap4j, at least  \n&gt; not in an early stage.\n&gt;\n&gt; Also, it could be useful to be able to set an &quot;acceptable CRAP  \n&gt; score&quot; on method level, and if it goes above that the method should  \n&gt; show up in the reports. Just to make sure that bad code doesn&#39;t get  \n&gt; any worse.\n&gt;\n&gt; Hope that&#39;s useful.\n&gt; / Per\n&gt;\n&gt; ________________________________\n&gt; From: junit@yahoogroups.com [mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com] On Behalf  \n&gt; Of Bob Evans\n&gt; Sent: Thursday, November 15, 2007 10:41 PM\n&gt; To: junit@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Subject: Re: [junit] Crap4j - Feedback and suggestions wanted\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi Per,\n&gt;\n&gt; We are focusing on the ability to filter tests in the Eclipse plugin\n&gt; and in the Ant task for our next\n&gt; iteration. It would be great to hear how you and others would like the\n&gt; feature to work.

Right now, one-shot code that I know is crap, and already\n&gt; &gt; scheduled to be deprecated or deleted, of course shows up at the top\n&gt; &gt; of the list. That makes it harder to spot the methods that really\n&gt; &gt; need to be looked at.\n&gt; &gt; / Per\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; \n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n",
