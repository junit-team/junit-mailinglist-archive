The\n&gt; company I work for has developed this connector to an EIS written in\n&gt; C/C++. This JCA connector uses the Command design pattern in order to\n&gt; get/send and validate information on the EIS.\n&gt; \n&gt; Now they have added two new commands to this connector and I&#39;m\n&gt; supposed to test them. As it&#39;s legacy code, there are no junit tests\n&gt; and I will be the first one to write them but only for those new\n&gt; commands. My idea is to test the JCA connector out of the container\n&gt; and have a mock EIS since testing inside the container and connecting\n&gt; to the real EIS seems really painfull to me. :) \n&gt; \n&gt; However, I have no clue how to do that cause the code under test does\n&gt; not offer a way of receiving a mock object. This code instanciates all\n&gt; it needs within the Command method execute.\n&gt; \n&gt; Is there any framework that could help me in this challenging\n&gt; situation? Something like simulating a fake container and EIS. I did\n&gt; some googling over the internet and also searched over this group but\n&gt; couldn&#39;t find anything :( Any ideas?\n\nHow do you gain access to the EIS? If it&#39;s through JNDI, then the \nMockEJB package provides a MockContext (fake JNDI context) where you can \nbind whatever object you want for each test. I assume your EIS \nimplements some Java interface, so you can easily fake it or mock it \naccording to your needs.\n\nGood luck.\n--\nJ. B.
