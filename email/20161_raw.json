Yes, you are right.  I suppose that i=\r\ns \nit...I want to verify the rows in the spreadsheet against the rows in \nt=\r\nhat table....and report on any inconsistencies.  That would do it.\n\nTesting=\r\n the application...written in Java/J2EE, exposed as Axis web \nservices...I =\r\nam comfortable writing JUnit or Cactus tests in that \ncontext.  I guess the=\r\n new challenge ... for me ... is the Excel \nspreadsheet.  How do I get at i=\r\nt from Java APIs?  I will do some \nonline research and googling into that..=\r\n..or listen to any ideas from \nthis group on how to go about that.\n\nAnd the=\r\nn the JDBC calls to the table...I think I can figure that out. \n\nThis whole=\r\n thing...spreadsheet rows comparison to database table....I \nthink I can re=\r\n-use this pattern in several places.  I will keep the \ngroup updated as I m=\r\nake progress if there is interest.\n\nThanks for your help,\n\nMike  \n\n\n\n\n\n--- =\r\nIn junit@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Lasse Koskela&quot; &lt;lasse.koskela@...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; H=\r\ni Mike,\n&gt; \n&gt; On Dec 12, 2007 10:47 PM, Mike Foley &lt;mike_foley_01612@...&gt; wr=\r\note:\n&gt; &gt;  I guess my problem statement is this: the business analysts have =\r\n\nan\n&gt; &gt;  Excel spreadsheet with hundreds of rows...each row defines some \nu=\r\nnique\n&gt; &gt;  requirement on the way this particular thing is supposed to \nwor=\r\nk. Each\n&gt; &gt;  row in this spreadsheet, each requirement if you will, is not\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;  implemented in code.....but in data...which I am calling \nreference da=\r\nta\n&gt; &gt;  or meta data....in this table.\n&gt; \n&gt; Would it make sense to have an =\r\nautomated test compare the rows in \nthe\n&gt; Excel sheet to the rows in the da=\r\ntabase table?\n&gt; \n&gt; Lasse\n&gt; \n&gt; -- \n&gt; Lasse Koskela\n&gt; * Author of &quot;Test Drive=\r\nn&quot; (Manning Publications, 2007) *\n&gt; * Reaktor Innovations * http://www.ri.f=\r\ni/en *\n&gt;\n\n\n\n",
