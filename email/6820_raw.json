I\ndeveloped some code from scratch the other day, and it\nfinally clicked for me since I&#39;ve been mulling these\nideas (Fixtures vs method/class testing)around in my\nhead as well.  \n  Having one .java for each general use case did make\nthe tests very well organized, I could look at my\nTestCase names and know immediately what functionality\nmy little utility had in general, and when I opened up\nthat file and looked at some of the individual test\nmethods I could see more detail.\n  That said, I don&#39;t think method/class testing is\nabsolutely horrible, definitely better to start there\nrather than not starting at all, and I&#39;ve gotten a lot\nof mileage from those type of tests in the past.\n   I guess the TestFixture approach helps you decouple\nthe tests from the implementation details a little\nmore, making them more &quot;black box&quot;, instead of leading\nyou testing every single method, even ones that\nprobably ought to be private.  (Though I sometimes\nlike the fact that some of the trickier would-be\nprivate methods have been completely covered by some\ngood tests, and am not as comfortable that I&#39;ve\ncovered all my bases if I simply test the\nnot-so-tricky higher level public APIs).\n\nJust my random thoughts on the subject\n- Jeff Tulley \n--------\nEric Armstrong  wrote:\nMessage: 13\n   Date: Tue, 28 Jan 2003 21:54:48 -0800\n   From: Eric Armstrong &lt;eric.armstrong@...&gt;\nSubject: Re: Re: Test first? or Stub first?\n\n&gt;  So said  Curt Sampson  on  2003-01-24\n--------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;...I find my test cases often don&#39;t parallel the\nparticular &gt;methods\n&gt; of a class. They test the typical usage patterns of\na class, instead.\n\nHmm. That strikes me as a key point. In essence, test\nconstruction\nshould\nfollow definition of use cases? Or words to that\neffect?\n\nI confess that although I&#39;m &quot;infected&quot;, I&#39;m having a\nhard time actually\ngenerating\ntests for anything other than individual functions.\nThat has been\nhelpful all by\nitself, but I&#39;ve got to get better at imagining\nfixtures and hanging\ntests off of them.\n\nI read TDD by Example, and enjoyed, but somehow I&#39;m\nstill missing that\nflash\nof insight that tells how to write the test first.\n(Too many years\nsitting in the\nsaddle backwards, I suspect.)\n\nIs thinking about &quot;use cases&quot; a profitable approach?\n\n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
