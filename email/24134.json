Even SSD space is cheap,<br/>\nRam is cheap, connections are fast. Checkout/pull junit with IntelliJ. It<br/>\nwill ask you to open the project. If you have configured a SDK other than 5<br/>\ngot to project settings (ctrl+alt+shift+s) and choose the one that you<br/>\nfavour. The project will be up and running. Checking out and configuring<br/>\ntakes me around 1 minute. IntelliJ is the most keyboard-centric IDE i know.<br/>\nIf you want to know a shortcut simply use ctrl+shift+a to search for the<br/>\ncommand and see the shortcut. You will not immediately know about all<br/>\nbenefits but as soon as you have learned to use the IDE properly and<br/>\nlearned about real Java development you will laugh at the idea of coding<br/>\nusing vi.<br/>\nWanting to develop effectively and staying with vi/working on just a few<br/>\nfiles simply does not mix. Developing Java (or any other advanced OO<br/>\nlanguage) means a lot of refactoring all the time. You will switch<br/>\napproaches constantly. Create/delete classes, move methods, rename<br/>\nmethods/parameters, change configuration, ... Without proper tool support<br/>\nthis is hard work. Also you will never get the style a project is coded in<br/>\nand its design without looking at the whole. For instance the code ive seen<br/>\nin junit so far is not the typical code style of a java project. I think a<br/>\nlot of code comes from people with a C background. If I would add a class<br/>\nthe way I usually write it it would simply not fit in.<br/>\nI cannot go into more detail but it would be a good idea to just drop the<br/>\nbearded-unwashed-linux-freak-attitude and give it a try. If you really are<br/>\nopen to something new I promise that you will not regret it. But dont take<br/>\nit lightly. It will take a few years to adjust and learn how to effectively<br/>\nuse the tools. Also theres a lot of blog-post reading, tutorial watching<br/>\naso. A good place to start to look at how things are served in the Java<br/>\nworld is <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://tv.jetbrains.net/channel/intellij-idea\">http://tv.jetbrains.net/channel/intellij-idea</a> . And PLEASE: dont<br/>\nrespond with &quot;i dont use flash&quot;. Thats another thing I dont want to discuss<br/>\nabout any more ;)<br/>\nRegards, Henning.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n2012/12/4 Jaroslav Tulach &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jaroslav.tulach@...\">jaroslav.tulach@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; **<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Dear command line lover.<br/>\n&gt; Your request is special. It might match the NetBeans vision of the IDE<br/>\n&gt; reproducing to 100% everything that happens on command line. Give it a<br/>\n&gt; try.<br/>\n&gt; NetBeans have excellent support for Maven, can deal quite well with (even<br/>\n&gt; 3rd<br/>\n&gt; party created) Ant scripts and there is an experimental support for Gradle.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; However, this still requires your checkout is buildable from command line.<br/>\n&gt; Checking-out a single file and hoping the IDE will think-up the<br/>\n&gt; surrounding<br/>\n&gt; environment is beyond the scope of what NetBeans (and obviously any other<br/>\n&gt; IDE)<br/>\n&gt; can do.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; We are trying to aim at &quot;self describing sources&quot;: When you have (you have<br/>\n&gt; checked out) sources that a (supported) command line tool can understood,<br/>\n&gt; NetBeans understands it as well.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -jt<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Dne �t 27. listopadu 2012 14:11:11, Fenn napsal(a):<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; hi folks,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I am a old command-line loving unix geek, but I want to get trendy and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; learn at least one IDE. Up until now vi+BASH has been my IDE of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; choice. I also already program in about two dozen languages.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; To try out my sea legs I want to compare and contract Eclipse,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Netbeans, and IntelliJ IDEA against the following use case:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I need to grock some java code in an existing SVN repository. I want<br/>\n&gt; &gt; to pull down one existing java file, write some junit tests, but not<br/>\n&gt; &gt; pull down the entire giant project it is attached to. I may need some<br/>\n&gt; &gt; moch objects too just to get it to compile, and to make the junit<br/>\n&gt; &gt; tests work.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Most of the how-to and intro stuff I can find on these IDEs starts<br/>\n&gt; &gt; with &quot;so you make your FIRST project, then pull down some menus, and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the wonderful IDE helps you type in your FIRST java program, then if<br/>\n&gt; &gt; you really want to you can save the entire project in CVS!&quot; This is<br/>\n&gt; &gt; hardly EVER the scenario I run into. It is more likely I need to jump<br/>\n&gt; &gt; into the middle of thousands or millions of existing files and learn<br/>\n&gt; &gt; to swim without breaking anything, maybe even fix a bug or add a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; feature.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Can anyone give me some tips on the &quot;best&quot; way to do this with his or<br/>\n&gt; &gt; her favorite IDE and some selection of plugins?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Brian Fennell<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",
