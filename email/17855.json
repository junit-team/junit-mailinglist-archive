To improve my development <br/>\n&gt;skills and my JUnit skills, I am writing some JUnit tests.  Today, I <br/>\n&gt;found that the developer had implemented System.exit(n) throughout <br/>\n&gt;the application whenever there was a trapped exception.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Now, the requirements call for the application to return some exit <br/>\n&gt;code telling any downstream processes whether this application was <br/>\n&gt;100% successful with no warnings (rc=0), 100% successful with <br/>\n&gt;warnings (rc=4), not successful at all (rc=8).  However, the only <br/>\n&gt;java mechanism for reporting return codes is System.exit(n), based on <br/>\n&gt;my use of Google.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;My JUnit dilemma then, is that System.exit(n) gives the required <br/>\n&gt;application behavior but doesn&#39;t seem to be good for running JUnit <br/>\n&gt;tests from a test suite since System.exit(n) ends the JVM.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Does anyone have any insights they can share?  Since this is my first <br/>\n&gt;post to this forum, I&#39;m happy to Google some more if you&#39;ll only give <br/>\n&gt;me some keyword hint(s) beyond what I&#39;ve already tried:  &quot;java exit <br/>\n&gt;code&quot;.<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It&#39;s hard to know who to be more upset at.. the developer for littering <br/>\nthe app with static calls or Sun for making the call static, and <br/>\ntherefore pretty much unmockable.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou may want to provide a try block at the entry point of your app and <br/>\nthen define an unchecked exception that you can throw instead of calling <br/>\nSystem.exit.  The exception can accept the exit code in its constructor. <br/>\n<br/>\n It&#39;s not an ideal solution, but it will allow you to slowly refactor to <br/>\nsomething saner.  Your entry point can catch the exception, glean the <br/>\nerror code and then call System.exit.  You can write tests that catch <br/>\nthe exception so that you can test the cases where you are supposed to <br/>\nexit.  If you do do this, make sure that you check for finally-blocks in <br/>\nyour exception chain.  If they do anything unnice, you&#39;ll have to do <br/>\nsomethng else.<br/>\n<br/>\nMichael Feathers<br/>\nwww.objectmentor.com</div>",
