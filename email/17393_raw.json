Not \nto mention all the interop, sy=\r\nstem , RAS and performance test that needs \nto be done in addition to the b=\r\nasic feature test.\n\nYou can never possibly test all of them. Otherwise, you=\r\n will never \ndeliver any product. If you able to do it, then I&#39;ve to assume=\r\n that the \nproduct consists of only 1 to 10 classes and not more than 5-10 =\r\npublic \nmethods, and even for that the # of tests to cover all combination =\r\nis huge.\n\nSo, the reality is that there will always be some code, which is =\r\nrun in \nsome combination, which has not been tested. It is the job of the \n=\r\nproduct Dev and QA architect, and leads to judiciously choose the right \nse=\r\nt of tests which provide maximum coverage (note, I don&#39;t mean code \ncoverag=\r\ne, as high code coverage can give a false sense of security).\n\nI don&#39;t beli=\r\neve in extremes like &quot;No tests&quot; or &quot;tests every possible \ncombination&quot;. The=\r\nre is a middle ground which practical people realize \nand strive to achieve=\r\n.\n\npeace,\n\n--Vishal\n\nJ. B.
