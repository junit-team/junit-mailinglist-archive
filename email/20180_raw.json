But all my member variable=\r\ns get initialized seperately in a\ndifferent method which is of no relation =\r\nwith the BIG method I wanted\nto test in the first place. \n\nCan I test my me=\r\nthod without worrying about the initialization of my\nobject&#39;s data, by mock=\r\ning the results of all my getter methods ?  \n\nEx: \n\nClass MyClass\n{\n   priv=\r\nate Object _member; \n   public void initialize()\n   {\n     //huge initializ=\r\nation process, which initializes my member\nvariables. \n      _member =3D ne=\r\nw Object(); \n   }\n\n   public void myHugeMethod()\n   {\n       //.. my logic =\r\nhere.\n       Object m =3D getMember(); \n       //... proceed with this valu=\r\ne. \n   }\n\n   public Object getMember()\n   {\n      return this._member; \n   =\r\n}\n}\n\nNow, if I call &#39;myHugeMethod()&#39; without calling &#39;initialize()&#39; method,=\r\n\nit always return NULL. \n\nAll i wanted to do is to test &#39;myHugeMethod()&#39;, b=\r\ny mocking\n&#39;getMember()&#39; method and setting the result what i wanted. \n\nI tr=\r\nied using Jmock for creating mocks in my test case, but it fails\nbecause th=\r\ne mock object only knows what exactly I wanted to mock but\nnothing more tha=\r\nn that. All my application logic is present in\n&#39;MyClass&#39; object not in its =\r\nmock. \n\nHow can I achieve this using Jmock ? \n\nFYI, I tried with a direct a=\r\npproach by extending &#39;MyClass&#39; and\noverriding the &#39;getMember()&#39; method in i=\r\nt. But I still feel there&#39;s a\nbetter way to do it. \n\nI&#39;ll be very thankful =\r\nfor any help in this regard.. \n\nThanks in advance, \nSarat kumar. \n\n\n",
