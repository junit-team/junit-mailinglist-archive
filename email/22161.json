The number of classes I&#39;d like<br/>\nto test this way is quite large.  I think having lots of different test<br/>\nsuites would quickly become unmanageable.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I need to build this capability myself, would building my own custom<br/>\nRunner be the right approach?  If so, is there some documentation on how<br/>\nto write a custom Runner?  Or do I just need to read the code?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nyme0987654321 wrote on 12/10/2009 08:23 PM:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The way I would handle this is to inject the relevant properties via a <br/>\n&gt; properties object, and then in production pass System.getProperties(), <br/>\n&gt; that way the tests are not coupled to the nasty global which is the <br/>\n&gt; System property.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; If that isn&#39;t an option for some reason, perhaps you can organize your <br/>\n&gt; different tests into suites, and set the system property in a <br/>\n&gt; @BeforeClass method on the suite?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Yishai<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a> &lt;mailto:junit%40yahoogroups.com&gt;, Bill <br/>\n&gt; Shannon &lt;Bill.Shannon@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;  &gt;<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; I&#39;ve read the FAQ and the javadocs and done much web searching but <br/>\n&gt; can&#39;t find<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; an answer to this. Sorry if this is stupid question.<br/>\n&gt;  &gt;<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; I need to write a test case that tests a class whose behavior depends on<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; a System property.

I&#39;d like to have multiple test cases, each of which sets a <br/>\n&gt; different<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; value for the System property, so each of the tests needs to be run in a<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; separate JVM or possibly a separate ClassLoader.<br/>\n&gt;  &gt;<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; Is there a simple way to (e.g.) annotate my test case to cause JUnit to<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; handle this for me?<br/>\n&gt;  &gt;<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; I&#39;m invoking JUnit as part of a maven build.
