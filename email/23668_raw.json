However, I&#39;m still curious to know...\n\nI think we&#39;re ready to cut a 4.10 beta 1 release from head, including\na raft of bug fixes, most notably the fix in the contents of junit-dep\nas released to maven.  Of those of you who plan on being beta-testers:\n\n1) Is there anyone who plans to download the jar directly from github\nfor testing?\n2) Is there anyone who plans to set the junit version in their pom to\n4.10-SNAPSHOT, and add https://oss.sonatype.org/content/groups/public\nas a snapshot repository, in order to test through maven?\n\nI&#39;m happy to support both beta-release paths if it turns out people\nare using both.\n\n   David Saff\n\n",
