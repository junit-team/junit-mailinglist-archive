JUnit<br/>\nwas not <br/>\n&gt; designed to work in this arena, though it does work quite well.<br/>\n<br/>\nExactly, I&#39;ve come to that same point.  It does work QUITE well,<br/>\nin fact, and one tweak to it lets it work perfectly for me, but I<br/>\ncan understand it being antithetical to the design.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn fact, that was what I was first asking, with way too many<br/>\nwords: what basic design principle of JUnit am I missing that<br/>\nmade it be written in a way that makes what I&#39;m trying to do,<br/>\nhard?<br/>\n<br/>\nI have to admit, I work for a start-up with a very small QA staff (2).<br/>\nIn a much larger company, there would be white-box SQA to<br/>\nbuild the higher level tests I&#39;m building, but as a small company<br/>\ndeveloper, I feel the need to build &#39;programmer tests&#39; that are a<br/>\n*lot* more comprehensive in order to make sure the code is<br/>\nreally solid before I hand it off.<br/>\n<br/>\n--  Morgan Schweers </span></blockquote></div>",
