The solution I had was to turn the\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nprivate methods to protected.\n&gt;\n&gt; In general, I dislike abstract classes, a=\r\nnd what you describe is one of\n&gt; the reasons I dislike them. If I owned the=\r\n Domain class, I would do this:\n&gt;\n&gt; 1. Move the validate() method onto a ne=\r\nw interface, called\n&gt; ValidationRuleset.\n&gt;\n&gt; 2. Change Domain so that it ac=\r\ncepts a ValidationRuleset into its\n&gt; constructor.\n&gt;\n&gt; 3. Change Domain so t=\r\nhat it invokes ValidationRuleset.validate() instead\n&gt; of its own validate()=\r\n method.\n&gt;\n&gt; Now it&#39;s easy to test Domain by simulating the ValidationRules=\r\net\n&gt; interface, and it&#39;s easy to test implementations of ValidationRuleset =\r\non\n&gt; their own.\n&gt;\n&gt; One might argue that this design change makes Domain mo=\r\nre complex, but I\n&gt; disagree: it replaces an abstract method with an additi=\r\nonal constructor\n&gt; parameter. That sounds like an even trade to me, getting=\r\n easier testing\n&gt; as a bonus in return.\n&gt;\n&gt; Take care.\n&gt;\n&gt; PS: It sounds to=\r\n me, based on very little information, that Domain is a\n&gt; purely abstract b=\r\nase class, and if it looks the way I think it looks,\n&gt; then it&#39;s a classic =\r\nmisuse of inheritance. Of course, I&#39;m jumping to a\n&gt; conclusion, so I might=\r\n be wrong.\n&gt; --\n&gt; J. B.
