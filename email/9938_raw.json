I&#39;m using the java.lang.String class as the object being \n&gt; tested, so that we only have to worry about writing one class instead \n&gt; of two.\n&gt;\n&gt; My question is: When testing overloaded methods (String.indexOf() in \n&gt; this specific case), is it better for each overloaded method get it&#39;s \n&gt; own testXXX() method or is it ok to lump them all in the one test? I \n&gt; have them all in one test right now, on the grounds that the test is \n&gt; against the index feature, rather than the individual methods.\n&gt;\n\nWhen I&#39;m writing learning tests of this sort, I usually group like \nmethods into a single test case method (e.g. testIndexing()).  When I&#39;m \nwriting production code, and I want to remember how to do string \nindexing, the test contains examples of the all the indexing things I&#39;m \nable to do with a string.\n\nIf testIndexing() grows uncomfortably big, for example, then I&#39;ll break \nit into individual test case methods.  I know it&#39;s too big if I find \nmyself having to wade through too many examples to find the one example \nI&#39;m looking for.  For example, I might end up with \ntestIndexingByCharacter and testIndexingByString.  That effectively \ncuts the example search in half, providing I know whether I&#39;m working \nwith characters or strings.\n\nBut that&#39;s just what works for me.\n\nMike \n\n\n",
