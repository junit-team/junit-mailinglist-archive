The test class is checking the<br/>\n&gt; dependencies and contents of the Maven artifacts produced by the build.<br/>\n&gt; I have some special build requirements which require me to use Maven<br/>\n&gt; Shade Plugin to bundle external (and in one case also internal)<br/>\n&gt; dependencies into the same JAR, and these build tests have been<br/>\n&gt; extremely helpful (more details at the first episodes of<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.orfjackal.net/lets-code#jumi)\">http://www.orfjackal.net/lets-code#jumi)</a>.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://github.com/orfjackal/jumi/blob/730378ddf5260cdcb44285c5c75e7a7ca5447407/end-to-end-tests/src/test/java/fi/jumi/test/BuildTest.java\">https://github.com/orfjackal/jumi/blob/730378ddf5260cdcb44285c5c75e7a7ca5447407/end-to-end-tests/src/test/java/fi/jumi/test/BuildTest.java</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The first two tests are parameterized. They check each artifact for its<br/>\n&gt; expected dependencies and contents.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The third test is checking one of the artifacts which was checked<br/>\n&gt; already earlier, but this time a copy the JAR which which is embedded<br/>\n&gt; inside another JAR (it&#39;s used in bootstrapping the application). Since<br/>\n&gt; this test is slow (~150ms), I want to avoid running it many times.<br/>\n&gt; Logically it&#39;s related to the things checked by the parameterized tests,<br/>\n&gt; so I want to keep it close to them, but it itself is not parameterized.<br/>\n&gt; Right now I&#39;ve solved the issue with a hack, so all but one<br/>\n&gt; parameterized execution skip the test.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The fourth and fifth test are tests against all of the parameters. It&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; testing the test data, to make sure that some project-wide principles<br/>\n&gt; are followed (i.e. no visible dependencies to external libraries). These<br/>\n&gt; tests also are not parameterized. Fortunately they are quick, so I<br/>\n&gt; haven&#39;t tried to avoid running them many times.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; What are your suggestions for mixing parameterized and non-parameterized<br/>\n&gt; tests? Some creative use of nested classes?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Don&#39;t. Put them in separate classes in the same (test) package. It is normal to <br/>\nhave one class in the system under test verified by several test classes; there <br/>\nis no rule that says there has to be a 1:1 correspondence.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve been thinking about extending Parameterized so that I can annotate<br/>\n&gt; which methods are parameterized and which are not, by adding either<br/>\n&gt; @ParameterizedTest or @NonParameterized annotations to the test methods.<br/>\n&gt; The non-parameterized methods would be run only once, probably using the<br/>\n&gt; first element in the test data (passing null to the constructor is<br/>\n&gt; another option; now it would fail in the constructor, but I should<br/>\n&gt; anyways relocate the couple of method calls which are now in the<br/>\n&gt; constructor).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You are over-complicating the problem.
