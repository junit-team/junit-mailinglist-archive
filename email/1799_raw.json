Examples include open \n&gt; source applications or products where the source code is the primary \n&gt; deliverable (e.g. frameworks).\n\nI think that we are talking about two different products: the final application (a jar in the Java world) and the development environment.\nThe tests code is part of the source code but not part of the final application.\nYou always can keep the tests in the cvs tree or a separate package for download.  If the customer has the knowledge to modify the code, he certainly know how to get code from a cvs tree :-)\n\n-Vladimir\n\n\n\n",
