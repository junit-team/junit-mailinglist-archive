There should be public, javadoc&#39;ed, committed, released API, \nbut there should also be some beta API&#39;s, protected methods without \ncommitment, public implementation classes in packages marked internal.  \nIs it necessary that the presence of the latter should interfere at all \nwith the comprehensibility or quality of the former?\n\n    David Saff\n\n",
