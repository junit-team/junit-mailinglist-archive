I suppose one possibility is that the assert is run, passes and \nyou&#39;re surprised. That should shock you immediately and not allow you to \nforget. :)\n\n&gt;Or am I just slower than the majority of developers?\n\nNo. You are, however, humbler.\n\nJBR.\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nGet your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com/intl.asp\n\n\n",
