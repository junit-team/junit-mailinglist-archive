All(?)<br/>\nIDE&#39;s support running JUnit tests in some way as well as buildtools, CI<br/>\nsevers etc. One issue with JUnit4 has always been that IDEs can&#39;t keep up<br/>\nwith JUnit and JUnit in turn is constrained with the current state of IDEs.<br/>\nIt is hard for other tools to compete because JUnit is already there.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Feature introspection&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nIt would be great if there was a way for 3rd part tools to ask JUnit for<br/>\nfeatures. A basic feature could be &quot;run all tests on classpath&quot;, or &quot;run<br/>\nnamed test&quot;, &quot;run category&quot;. As a 3rd party tool vendor I could then query<br/>\nJUnit for features and delegate more of the work to JUnit. If we take<br/>\ncategories as an example. Today eclipse simply doesn&#39;t recognize them but<br/>\nwith feature introspection it could just appear as a choice in a menu.<br/>\n<br/>\nA feature would have some basic categorization where some categories are<br/>\nwell known such as &quot;run&quot; so that tools can logically present the basics.<br/>\nA feature would have some way to declare it&#39;s required input, referably<br/>\nwith some types (like: A test, A category, A suite, A test with parameters<br/>\netc, Needs a resultbuilder etc).<br/>\nA feature would have some way to describe itself &quot;Runs the specified<br/>\ncategory of tests&quot;<br/>\nA feature can be contributed by a 3rd party like a custom runner can.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith features it would also open up new possibilities with tools like Ant,<br/>\nMaven, Gradle etc where features can be delegated to JUnit and it would be<br/>\nsimpler to build and maintain testrelated tasks since they would not<br/>\nrequire to be available as compiled tasks before the build starts,<br/>\nextensions can be built and maintained in the same way as your tests until<br/>\nyou want to share them with others.<br/>\n<br/>\nAdmittedly this is an idea that is not finished. I&#39;m basically aiming at<br/>\nbridging the gap a bit between 3rd party tools and the JUnit core without<br/>\nhaving to implement UI and solve UX problems.<br/>\n<br/>\nThoughts?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",
