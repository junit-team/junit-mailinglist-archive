B. Rainsberger&quot; &lt;jbrains@r...&gt; \n&gt;wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; The whole point of=\r\n JUnit is automate those tests so that you do not \n&gt;have to physically look=\r\n at the result to verify it. You code what you \n&gt;expect in the test and the=\r\n test runner tells you whether the results \n&gt;match your expectations. This =\r\nis in perfect alignment with the \n&gt;purpose of JUnit.\n&gt;\n&gt;That is a good thin=\r\ng but there is more than one way to think about \n&gt;it. \n\nNo argument against=\r\n it.\n\n&gt;&gt; There are many reasons to write tests this way. I suggest reading =\r\n\n&gt;the available literature, especially Kent Beck&#39;s Test-Driven \n&gt;Developmen=\r\nt by Example, http://www.xprogramming.com and \n&gt;http://www.junit.org.\n&gt;\n&gt;Th=\r\nanks, maybe you should do some more reading too and listen to other \n&gt;devel=\r\nopers to expand your perspective to include viewpoints other \n&gt;than your ow=\r\nn.\n\nI&#39;ve done it and moved on; there&#39;s no need for me to re-live it. I&#39;ve a=\r\nlready gone through what you&#39;re going through, learned from it and got to w=\r\nhere I am today. If that stops working for me, then I&#39;ll move on.\n\nPlease d=\r\non&#39;t assume that because my opinion is different from yours that that means=\r\n that I don&#39;t completely understand your opinion. In this case, &quot;been there=\r\n; done that.&quot;\n\n&gt;&gt; If JUnit wastes your time, \n&gt;\n&gt;word twisting, never said =\r\nthat.\n\nI believe you said that JUnit forces you to duplicate your tests. Ho=\r\nw is that not a waste of time? And what about my suggestion for dealing wit=\r\nh that duplication? Did you decide it wouldn&#39;t help?\n\n&gt;&gt;If you think JUnit =\r\nis beneficial, \n&gt;\n&gt;I do, and as I indicated I have plenty of experience wit=\r\nh automated \n&gt;testing using xUnit.\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;then you have to change your approac=\r\nh to work with JUnit. If you \n&gt;want to do something slightly different than=\r\n JUnit, then you have to \n&gt;find that or build it yourself.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I think th=\r\nose are your options.\n&gt;\n&gt;How about just hacking junit? Make it do something=\r\n the designers \n&gt;never intended. That&#39;s another option.\n\nIf you want to for=\r\nk JUnit to a new project, no-one will stop you. I&#39;m not sure what the diffe=\r\nrence is between &quot;hacking JUnit&quot; and building something for yourself, thoug=\r\nh. No-one said you had to build from scratch.\n\nIf you&#39;re interested in disc=\r\nussing the issues, that&#39;s fine. If you&#39;re going to allow yourself to be sid=\r\netracked by arguing about my motives, then please direct your energy elsewh=\r\nere. I&#39;m not interested in discussing that.\n\n\nJ. B.
