If the one-time setup does something\n&gt; in an external data source, like a database, then all\n&gt; is well; but if it changes data inside the JVM, how do\n&gt; the test cases gain access to that data? Class-level\n&gt; variables, I guess.\n&gt; \n&gt; :)\n&gt; \n&gt; JBR.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ______________________________________________________________________ \n&gt; Web-hosting solutions for home and business! http://website.yahoo.ca\n\n\n",
