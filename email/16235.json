    "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1335192404\">I&#39;ve been using EMMA for quite a while.  When I chose it in early 2004, the landscape of open source coverage tools was pretty sparse.  I evaluated EMMA, jcoverage, and groboutils.  At that time JCoverage didn&#39;t work well for us -- it couldn&#39;t handle our large codebase.  Groboutils was slooow.<br/>\n<br/>\nEMMA was fast, had good docs, was easy to integrate into our ant build scripts, and had responsive support.  The reports are &quot;OK&quot;; I like clover&#39;s better, but did not want to pay $$$.  Having said that, the reports are good enough for us and provide a green/yellow/red line-based view of your java source files showing what lines were fully/partially/non executed.  The ant tasks provide easy customization of the reports.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI recommend EMMA highly.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve not looked at cobertura.<br/>\n<br/>\nJohn<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: jason r tibbetts [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:tibbettj@...\">tibbettj@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Thursday, February 23, 2006 7:53 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [junit] Code coverage analysis with JUnit<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAnderson John-QA2554 wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  <br/>\n&gt; Has anyone integrated and used JUnit and EMMA on a large scale<br/>\n&gt; commercial product?  If so, were you satisfied with EMMA as a code<br/>\n&gt; coverage analysis tool?  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Is there a better open source code coverage analysis tool available that<br/>\n&gt; works with JUnit? <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Are there a better commercial code coverage analysis tools available<br/>\n&gt; that work with JUnit? <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve used the GPL&#39;d jcoverage, cobertura (a more up-to-date rewrite of <br/>\njcoverage), and EMMA. Of the three, I prefer cobertura for its clean <br/>\nlayout. EMMA&#39;s output looks quite clunky, even though it does provide a <br/>\nbit more information than the other two.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\nYahoo!
