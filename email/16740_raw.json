Writes:\n&gt; \n&gt;  &gt; Also, Agitator can help retrofit tests to legacy code, however it\n&gt;  &gt; /doesn&#39;t/ help you identify the specific design problems in that code,\n&gt;  &gt; nor does it motivate you to improve the design. This might or might not\n&gt;  &gt; concern your team at this time.\n&gt; \n&gt; This is Alberto jumping in again to set the record straight on\n&gt; Agitator ...\n&gt; \n&gt; Hi Joe, you might not remember me but we exchanged emails a couple of\n&gt; years ago, and I am a big fan of yours for all the work you have done\n&gt; to educate people about JUnit through your book and online presence.\n&gt; \n&gt; Anyway ... your description of using Agitator to complement TDD is\n&gt; spot-on (for people who do TDD) - thank you for jumping in and helping\n&gt; in setting the record straight.  But you also state (I paraphrase):\n&gt; &quot;Agitator does not help you identify design problems or motivate you\n&gt; to improve the design&quot;.  We have actually found, somewhat\n&gt; serendipitously, that Agitator does indeed help you in identifying\n&gt; design problems and even provides you compelling motivations to\n&gt; address them (e.g. well designed code Agitates better).\n&gt; \n&gt; A simple example, of Agitator helping you improve your design is\n&gt; blogged on developertesting.com:\n&gt; \n&gt; http://www.developertesting.com/archives/month200402/20040226-TestDrivenDevelopmentAndAgitatorDrivenRefactoring.html\n&gt; \n&gt; Again, this does not mean that Agitator replaces TDD, but it can\n&gt; complement TDD efforts (our own Dashboard product was developed\n&gt; practicing TDD, pair-programming, etc., AND Agitator of course).\n\nThis is an interesting article, Alberto, and I thank you for involving \nyourself in this thread. It&#39;s great to have you here.\n\nNow I don&#39;t necessarily agree that checking an exception message is \n/good design/. I also don&#39;t necessarily agree that having a negative \nvalue for &#39;score&#39; is cause for an exception--it depends where the system \nboundaries are.\n\nEven with all that, it is clear that Agitator did help Jeffrey follow \nhis coding style, and that is quite good.\n\nFinally, I should mention that this is not the kind of design problem I \nhave in mind when I made my admittedly baseless claim. Since it was \nbaseless, I should revise my claim. Here it is:\n\n     When I write JUnit tests, I am forced to deal with dependency\n     problems in my code. I don&#39;t yet have any evidence that Agitator\n     would help me with that. I am concerned that since Agitator helps\n     me /not/ write JUnit tests, it might also help me /not/ feel the\n     pain of those kinds of dependency problems.\n\nThanks for helping me clarify things, Alberto. I don&#39;t like \nmisrepresenting someone else&#39;s product.\n\nTake care.\n-- \nJ. B.
