Since we currently have more than 500 test cases it is <br/>\ndifficult to do this manually. It would of course be easy if the <br/>\nnormal success rate was 100%, but a number of test cases fail since <br/>\nthe implementation is not yet completed. I would like to input two <br/>\nversions of the JUnit output (which currently is in XML format), and <br/>\nget a report of what the difference is between the two.<br/>\n<br/>\nIs there a tool that can help me with this?<br/>\n<br/>\n/Daniel</div>",
