Then later, if I find some extra time,\nI&#39;ll try to w=\r\nrite a few unit tests that will allow me to converge toward\nproblems faster=\r\n. Because that&#39;s all unit tests enable: faster pinpointing of\na problem. If=\r\n 100% of your tests are functional, you will still find the\nproblem but it =\r\nmight take you a little longer. Not a big deal.\n\nIt&#39;s unfortunate that unit=\r\n tests have become such a high focus of attention\nlately (and another reaso=\r\nn why TDD makes me uncomfortable). High emphasis on\nunit tests and on TDD i=\r\ns engineers trying to make their work easier. It&#39;s a\nlaudable goal, but it =\r\nshould never come at the expense of the person whom\nyou are working for: th=\r\ne customer.\n\nAnd the only tests that really matter to the customer are func=\r\ntional tests.\n\n-- \nC=E9dric\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been =\r\nremoved]\n\n\n",
