Really?<br/>\n<br/>\nI think we have some time. There was some delay between TestNG being<br/>\nreleased and the release of JUnit 4.0, but JUnit 4 still got adopted.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; Also agree with David that watching the steps of other new frameworks is<br/>\n </span></blockquote>important as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was thinking about that. JavaScript is a functional language, but all of<br/>\nthe JS test frameworks that I am aware of use JUnit-like syntax for<br/>\ndefining test cases (JsUnit defines test functions at global scope,<br/>\nJsTestDriver uses methods on a class). If functional programming could<br/>\nchange the paradigm for defining tests, you would think it would have<br/>\nhappened in JavaScript.<br/>\n<br/>\nAm I missing something?<br/>\n<br/>\nSure, you could use functional programming to write more powerful<br/>\nassertions, but that could be done in an assertion framework.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe places I see where functional programming could help are Theories<br/>\nand parametrised tests. I think we could do that in JUnit4 with at most a<br/>\nnew core Runner.<br/>\n<br/>\nSure, there are many parts of the implementation of JUnit 4 that I would<br/>\nlove to change, but building a new Java test framework from scratch would<br/>\nbe a large effort. One often-forgotten piece is all the tooling (IDE<br/>\nintegration, build tool integration, etc).<br/>\n<br/>\n- Kevin<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; The modularity, as somebody mentioned, has to be also considered, but<br/>\n </span></blockquote>without knowing the outcome it is quite difficult.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; So perhaps template tests under new languages without having a framework<br/>\n </span></blockquote>should be written first to see what wants to be reached.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Features and goals from other projects should be considered.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; BR, Tibor<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;jens_schauder&quot; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; It looks like Closure will finally find their way into Java. With this<br/>\n </span></blockquote>feature many nice ways to do thing become possible. Therefore I am<br/>\nwondering if other people agree that it might be time for a JUnit5 putting<br/>\nthis new feature to good use.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; A source for inspiration for me in this regard are the FunSuite of<br/>\n </span></blockquote>ScalaTest <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.scalatest.org/getting_started_with_fun_suite\">http://www.scalatest.org/getting_started_with_fun_suite</a><br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; There a test definition is a method call (instead of a method<br/>\n </span></blockquote>definition in JUnit) that registers a test for execution. It looks roughly<br/>\nlike this:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; class MyTestClass{<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; test(&quot;The test name&quot;){<br/>\n&gt; &gt; // the actual test goes here<br/>\n&gt; &gt; }<br/>\n&gt; &gt; }<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; With this approach things like Rules become extremly trivial, since all<br/>\n </span></blockquote>you have to do is wrap the code block (i.e. closure) in a new new code<br/>\nblock.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Also parameterized test become fairly easy, because you would just put<br/>\n </span></blockquote>the call to test in a loop.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; What do you think? Is this an interesting direction for JUnit to go?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; kind regards<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Jens<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",
