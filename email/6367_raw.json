Some of these are actually quick\nfunctional/acceptance tests which are testing the object interaction. \nSo, with those few taken out (about 10 - 15), our tests take under 2\nminutes.\n\nSummary: 2 minutes for somewhere around 1185 tests.\n\n=jason\n\nOn Wed, 2002-12-04 at 17:32, J.

What external resources do they talk to? Are they blocking on\nsomething?\n\nPerhaps it&#39;s not the tests you should change, but the integration\nbetween components involved in the test. When tests take too long to\nexecute, that often indicates a performance problem you&#39;ll encounter in\nproduction. You&#39;d better deal with it now while it&#39;s still a\nmanageable, low-pressure job.\n\nJ. B.
