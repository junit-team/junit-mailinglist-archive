I mean, I have a framework that uses xml configuration<br/>\nand XPATH to make some assertion tests from our server, and I would<br/>\nlike to run them using junit, as it would be easier to generate<br/>\nreports and so on. The problem is that the tests are dinamic and<br/>\ndepend on an external configuration file. So if i do asserts inside a<br/>\nloop it would leave the method on the first fail/error, is there any<br/>\nway to store all the asserts and process them afterwards? what would<br/>\nyou suggest?<br/>\n<br/>\nthanks<br/>\nemerson</div>",
