I see it all the time. More specifically, I see people <br/>\nacting as though they do /not/ have permission to remove dead code. &quot;If <br/>\nit ain&#39;t broke, don&#39;t fix it&quot; and &quot;Don&#39;t touch it; it might break&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n, can I use a factory here?,<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; can I draw a UML-diagram on the whiteboard?, can I save it in<br/>\n&gt; documentation?, can I call a designmeeting?&quot; so why is unit-testing<br/>\n&gt; different?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Anything that a project manager in particular might perceive as /extra/ <br/>\ntime is different. That includes refactoring, testing (we have a whole <br/>\ndepartment for that), design meetings, and so on. Of course, it depends <br/>\non what activities that project manager participated in himself when he <br/>\nwrote code.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I think, if you manage to convince your team /first/ then management is as<br/>\n&gt; good as convinced when the results start showing.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>...but in the meantime, when the team goes through the chaos period, <br/>\nmanagement has plenty of time and opportunity to step and say, &quot;See? I <br/>\ntold you this stuff was extra effort. Why are you doing this? Stop <br/>\nwasting our money.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I think by example is the best way to go, start with your self and influence<br/>\n&gt; those around you.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; /if/ you are convinced about the benefits of unittesting then /not/ doing<br/>\n&gt; unittesting would be unprofessional since you choose not to do it.<br/>\n&gt; So start doing it and infect the others. Don&#39;t have managment inject the<br/>\n&gt; virus into an unwilling team by placing demands on testcoverage etc.<br/>\n&gt; That will rebound in my experience.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; So, what do you think? Should we tell the story to our fellow developers<br/>\n&gt; instead of management?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t understand why you would frame the question as &quot;instead of&quot;. Why <br/>\nnot &quot;in addition to&quot;? I think my manager deserve to know what I&#39;m doing.<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJ. B.
