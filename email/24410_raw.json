If you want\n&gt; a certain behaviour you need to use a s=\r\npecific runner. Often you will want\n&gt; more than just one behaviour. For exa=\r\nmple you may want the spring runner\n&gt; with junit and jparams behaviour. Som=\r\netimes you will find a way to makr\n&gt; that work. Sometimes you just dont. A =\r\nrework of the runner-concept,\n&gt; introducing something like a chain for the =\r\nbehaviour-part would be a good\n&gt; idea, i guess. This could either be achiev=\r\ned by introducing a runner that\n&gt; does the work or by introducing this conc=\r\nept deeper into the framework. How\n&gt; are your thoughts on this? It could on=\r\nly work well when introduced to junit\n&gt; and the old concept would get marke=\r\nd deprecated as this makes\n&gt; runner-providers like spring migrate to the ne=\r\nw concept. I would be willing\n&gt; to give it a try and implement this if you =\r\nthink its a good idea. Another\n&gt; thing: anyone got junit formatter file?\n&gt; =\r\nRegards, Henning\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed=\r\n]\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
