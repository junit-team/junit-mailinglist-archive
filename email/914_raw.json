You\n&gt; &gt; can test those easily with JUnit.\n&gt; &gt; The EJB should be only a very THIN facade into this java\n&gt; &gt; package. The EJB doesn&#39;t do anything by itself, it only\n&gt; &gt; redirects the client requests.\n&gt;\n&gt; This is a nice aim, but it&#39;s not always possible. That said, it&#39;s still\nworth striving for.\n&gt; The main problem area is when you want your EJB to leverage the container\nin some way. For example, you might want to lookup another &gt; EJB.\n\n\nMy functional code does need information from other EJBs, that&#39;s true. But I\nstill try to follow the rule that the functional code is not allowed to\naccess the EJB layer. The thin EJB however that sits on top of the\nfunctional code lives in the EJB layer, and he IS allowed to access other\nEJBs. So I let the EJB talk to other EJBs, collect all necessary information\nthat my functional layer needs, and let it pass that information in.\n\nSo far, it has always been possible.\n\nNow we have some vertical slices in the code that are entirely independent\nof each other. There&#39;s an interface layer on top of each, and that interface\nhappens to be implemented by EJBs. The EJBs act as glue code between the\ndifferent vertical slices.\n\n\n",
