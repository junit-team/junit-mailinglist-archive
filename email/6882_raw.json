As Kent Beck says, if\n&gt; you follow TDD religiously, you should have 100% statement coverage\n&gt; for your code. Let me repeat that: 100%.\n\nYes, Kent Beck indeed did say, &quot;TDD followed religiously should result\nin 100% statement coverage.&quot; But on the other hand, the sentence\nbefore that in his TDD book is &quot;Statement coverage is certainly not a\nsufficient measure of test quality, but it is a starting place.&quot; If you\nlook at the chapter on method/class scope testing in Binder&#39;s _Testing\nObject Oriented Systems_, you&#39;ll find that having meerly full statement\ncoverage is pretty poor test quality indeed. If you&#39;re looking just at a\ncoverage metric, I&#39;d say you want at least full coverage of branches.\n\nBut then again, Kent Beck also said, on page 115/6 of _Extreme\nProgramming Explained_, &quot;So you should write the tests that help get\nprograms working and keep programs working. Nothing more.&quot;\n\nIn the end, it really depends on the consequences of failure. In most\nof the systems I build, the consequence of failure is a stack exception\nappearing on the screen and a slightly troubled user. No big deal if\nthat happens once in a while; I just find, fix and roll out a new release.\n\nOn the other hand, if I had an embedded system that was going to be\nmass-produced, where a new release is extremely expensive, I&#39;d spend a\nlot more money and time testing.\n\n&gt; I engaged in a stimulating debate with Curt on his answer, which I tried to\n&gt; argue wasn&#39;t as elegant or object oriented, in principle, as a mock object\n&gt; approach.  It won&#39;t result in 100% statement coverage, for one thing (which\n&gt; will require you to trust Curt or whomever that the 5% of code that isn&#39;t\n&gt; covered by unit tests, &quot;can&#39;t go wrong,&quot; which might be true, but more\n&gt; likely not).\n\nActually, I see it as relying on my judgement that it&#39;s cheaper to deal\nwith the rare failures in that area when they happen than it is to spend\nthe money and time for more comprehensive test coverage.\n\n&gt; So why are we arguing such different strategies for solving\n&gt; the problem of &quot;testability?&quot;\n\nBecause we&#39;re costing it out differently. That&#39;s all.\n\n&gt; Put another way, I wonder the same thing about any behavior added to an\n&gt; object.  Testing is not a behavior of most objects.\n\nWell, this perhaps a point of disagreement. I think that testing is a\npotential behaviour of every object I write.\n\n&gt; It seems the best way to build and test a finite-state machine is\n&gt; to make the inputs and outputs explicit, and to make the state\n&gt; transitions step-wise and traceable.\n\nI would consider that to be modifying an object, beyond its overt\nfunction, to make it more testable.\n\nIf you didn&#39;t have to test the object, because you always wrote perfect\ncode, would you bother exposing the state-wide transitions?\n\ncjs\n-- \nCurt Sampson  &lt;cjs@...&gt;   +81 90 7737 2974   http://www.netbsd.org\n    Don&#39;t you know, in this new Dark Age, we&#39;re all light.  --XTC\n\n",
