Which one is the next one? TestNG?\nThis custom runner stuff is cool! Keep up the good work!\n\n\nOn 9/9/07, David Saff &lt;saff@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;   Joakim,\n&gt;\n&gt; I think it&#39;s really interesting stuff. I&#39;m not currently using Ruby,\n&gt; but I have built Java / Ruby hybrid systems in the past, and I think I\n&gt; would use this if I needed to again in the future. I&#39;m also really\n&gt; glad to see the custom Runner support get a thorough workout.\n&gt;\n&gt; David\n&gt;\n&gt; On 9/8/07, Joakim Ohlrogge &lt;joakim.ohlrogge@...&lt;joakim.ohlrogge%40gmail.com&gt;&gt;\n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Hi all, I have been playing with JRuby recently and in particular how\n&gt; &gt; to embed Ruby in Java applications. I believe that mixing languages\n&gt; &gt; rather than switching completely from one language to another is going\n&gt; &gt; to be more and more important. As I explored the subject i found\n&gt; &gt; myself lacking some tools. I was frustrated by the fact that I had to\n&gt; &gt; maintain two sets of tests and look for feedback in two different\n&gt; &gt; locations while developing.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I created a custom runner for JUnit to address the subject and I think\n&gt; &gt; it looks promising. I created a blog entry with some more details in\n&gt; &gt; case anyone is interested:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; http://johlrogge.wordpress.com/2007/09/08/hybrid-theory/\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I have some loose plans on open-sourcing this but I would like to see\n&gt; &gt; if there are others than me that find this interesting enough to be\n&gt; &gt; worth the effort before I do.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; /Joakim Ohlrogge\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Yahoo!
