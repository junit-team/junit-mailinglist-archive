This is why it always creates a new<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; instance of the test class for each test.<br/>\n&gt;  &gt;<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; If you really don&#39;t want your tests to be isolated, then I agree this is<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; a waste of resources, but I have two questions:<br/>\n&gt;  &gt;<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; 1. Do you really want your tests /not/ to be isolated?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; You make it sound as if the only way to have isolated tests is for JUnit to<br/>\n&gt; create a new instance every time...<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I merely wanted to test Vietchau&#39;s assumptions before giving too much <br/>\nincorrect advice.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; There are other ways that are just as<br/>\n&gt; valid :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>That&#39;s true, but that&#39;s not what JUnit does, and this is a JUnit list, <br/>\nso I thought I would ask questions and offer advice within the context <br/>\nof JUnit.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; As you already know, I think it would be nice if JUnit at least gave us the<br/>\n&gt; option.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>For years, we have answered people&#39;s &quot;how do I do X?&quot; questions with <br/>\ndiscussions about design. I no longer think that is appropriate, so I <br/>\ndidn&#39;t intend to get into a design discussion so quickly.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Most of my tests have immutable state that is quite expensive to create, so<br/>\n&gt; using the same instance wouldn&#39;t violate the isolation since none of my<br/>\n&gt; tests will actually modify that state (they will just run tests against it),<br/>\n&gt; and they can therefore still be invoked in any order.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>That is one safe way to maintain test isolation without having to <br/>\ninstantiate the resources each time. I have no way to know whether <br/>\nthat&#39;s Vietchau&#39;s situation, so I ask questions.<br/>\n<br/>\nMost of my tests don&#39;t have expensive-to-create test state, so that&#39;s <br/>\nthe way I tend to avoid the problem. Once again, I didn&#39;t plan to inject <br/>\nthat into the discussion until I knew more.<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJ. B.
