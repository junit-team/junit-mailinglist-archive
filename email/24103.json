That site has been<br/>\n&gt; operated and maintained by 8thlight.com for several years, and by Object<br/>\n&gt; Mentor before that.  But it recently had a rather nasty failure, and it&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; not clear when the content that had been hosted only there will come back.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Rather than spend a lot of effort recreating the old situation, I&#39;d like to<br/>\n&gt; move us to a new situation, in which the team that develops JUnit is the<br/>\n&gt; same one that develops the primary information sources about JUnit.  Along<br/>\n&gt; those lines, I&#39;d like to get the github pages for JUnit ready to be a good<br/>\n&gt; new home for junit.org.  These pages are hosted at<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://kentbeck.github.com/junit.\">http://kentbeck.github.com/junit.</a>  They&#39;re currently pretty sad, but they<br/>\n&gt; can be edited by opening pull requests against<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://github.com/KentBeck/junit/tree/gh-pages.\">https://github.com/KentBeck/junit/tree/gh-pages.</a>  Ideally, it would be a<br/>\n&gt; visually clean single page, with a short description of what JUnit is, and<br/>\n&gt; links to downloads, javadoc, mailing list, and the wiki (<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://github.com/kentbeck/junit/wiki)\">http://github.com/kentbeck/junit/wiki)</a>, which is itself incomplete, but<br/>\n&gt; getting better day by day as a source of user documentation.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; If anyone feels like rolling up their sleeves and give this a try, it would<br/>\n&gt; be a great step forward.  I&#39;m out of the office all next week, but am happy<br/>\n&gt; to move quickly getting the pieces in place upon my return.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thanks, all,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;    David Saff<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Yahoo!
