This causes the Object version of assert equals to be <br/>\ncalled, rather than the String version, and you will see the entire <br/>\nstrings in the failure message.  e.g.,<br/>\n<br/>\n    assertEquals((Object) &quot;I want to see the whole string&quot;, &quot;I did <br/>\nsee the whole string&quot;);<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI will sometimes do this when I can&#39;t figure out immediately why a <br/>\ntest is failing.  Other times, I like the &quot;...&quot; behavior.  <br/>\nInterestingly enough, the &quot;...&quot; behaviour is new to JUnit 3.8--I <br/>\nbelieve that Alex Chafee and others submitted it as a request.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope this helps.<br/>\n<br/>\nJeff Nielsen<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Robert Huffman&quot; &lt;rhuffman@b...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; The behavior of ComparisonFailure.getMessage() is to replace<br/>\n&gt; equivalient parts of the actual and expected strings with &quot;...&quot;. In <br/>\nmy<br/>\n&gt; opinion, this is truly dreadful behavior. Yet there seems to be no <br/>\nway<br/>\n&gt; to modify this behavior without changing the source code. And this <br/>\nis<br/>\n&gt; because of what is, IMHO and with all due respect to Beck and Gamma,<br/>\n&gt; bad design: all the Assert.assert* methods are static.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; While a discussion of the design decisions in junit would probably <br/>\nbe<br/>\n&gt; enlightening, that&#39;s not my goal; here. I would just like <br/>\nsuggestions<br/>\n&gt; of how to get the strings, in their entirities, into the output.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Perhaps the answer is to write my own subclass of TestRunner, but <br/>\nthen<br/>\n&gt; I would have to figure out how to integrate the new TestRunner into<br/>\n&gt; JBuilder.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Any help would be appreciated. </span></blockquote></div>",
