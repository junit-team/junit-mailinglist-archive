Looking through the JUnit code, I seem to have propagated another <br/>\nurban myth.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat said, I always believed that the protocol says that setUp() and <br/>\nteardown() should be for administration of the test and that the <br/>\nbusiness of the test should be done within the test* methods. In the <br/>\njMock library, we have a VerifyingTestCase that overrides runBare() to <br/>\nsupport this approach.<br/>\n<br/>\nS.<br/>\n<br/>\nVincent Massol wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; What&#39;s wrong with that?
