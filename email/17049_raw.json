If you know how both of\nthese functions are implemented internally, you can make an informed\ndecision as to which one to use for any specific situation.\n\n \n\nThe equals() method compares the characters that make up String objects. It\nperforms this comparison by putting the characters of the String objects\ninto two char arrays and comparing the two arrays. The method returns true\nif all the elements of the char arrays match and false otherwise.\n\n \n\nThe == operator compares two object references to see whether they refer to\nthe same instance. A pool of strings, initially empty, is maintained\nprivately by the class String. All literal strings and string-valued\nconstant expressions are interned there. You can also add your own strings\nto this pool by calling the intern() method. If the pool already contains a\nstring equal to your String object, as determined by the equals(Object)\nmethod, then the string from the pool is returned. Otherwise, your String\nobject is added to the pool and a reference to it is returned. It follows\nthat, for any two strings s and t, s.intern()==t.intern() is true if and\nonly if s.equals(t) is true.\n\n \n\nTo sum up: The equals() method determines whether two strings have the same\ncharacters, whereas the == operator determines if two operands refer to the\nsame String object. == actually tests to see if the references in the\nvariables point to the same memory address.\n\n \n\nVarious ways of testing equality:\n\n \n\n//adds &quot;literal&quot; to the intern pool\n\nString strObj1 = &quot;literal&quot;;               \n\n \n\n//uses &quot;literal&quot; from the pool\n\nString strObj2 = &quot;literal&quot;;      \n\n                             \n\n//creates a new string.\n\nString strObj3 =  new String(&quot;literal&quot;);       \n\n \n\n//checks in the pool for a match and if found, returns the match.         \n\nString strObj4 =  strObj3.intern();               \n\n \n\n//prints true - strObj4 and strObj3 have the same string.\n\nSystem.out.println((strObj4.equals(strObj3));       \n\n \n\n//prints false - strObj4 and strObj3 do not refer to the same \n\n//string object.\n\nSystem.out.println((strObj4 == strObj3));      \n\n \n\n//prints true - strObj4 and strObj2 have the same string.\n\nSystem.out.println((strObj4.equals(strObj2));\n\n \n\n//prints true - strObj4 and strObj2 refer to the same string object \n\n//in the pool.\n\nSystem.out.println((strObj4 == strObj2));     \n\n \n\nIt&#39;s important to understand that, in the Java programming language, a\nstring is immutable once it has been created. There are no methods that\nchange the contents of a string; there are only methods that take the source\nstring as input and return another string with the same name as output.\n\n \n\nIn that light, consider the case of strObj1 and strObj2 in Listing 1. Even\nthough two strings are initialized, to save space and reduce complexity, the\nJVM allocates only a single instance of the character sequence &quot;literal&quot; and\nboth strObj1 and strObj2 are made to refer to its memory location. As a\nresult, it may be redundant to create string instances like strObj3 if the\ncontents are going to be the same.\n\n \n\nUsing intern() involves the overhead of searching an internal table (pool)\nof strings and inserting the literal into this pool (if it doesn&#39;t already\nexist); nevertheless, the intern() method is very powerful. It saves memory\nby avoiding duplicate strings in memory. It also compares pooled strings; by\ncontrast, the equals() method compares character sequences. So if your\napplication uses a lot of repeated literals for comparison, use the intern()\nmethod to improve performance.\n\n \n\nThanks,\n\n-Kamal.\n\n \n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: junit@yahoogroups.com [mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com] On Behalf Of Kent\nBeck\nSent: Monday, June 26, 2006 2:20 AM\nTo: junit@yahoogroups.com\nSubject: RE: [junit] message &quot;null&quot;\n\n \n\nErnst,\n\n \n\nThanks for checking.
