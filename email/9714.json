What I was trying to do was before testing a <br/>\ncase or cases which has a few steps transaction, so for parts of the <br/>\ntransaction I was putting asserts although JUnit will fail it when it <br/>\nfirst finds it but the drawback is it don&#39;t tell which one so what I <br/>\ndid was I changed to throw the AssertFailureException(&quot;Message&quot;) and <br/>\nI got the desired results.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks everyone.<br/>\nPrabhat</div>",
