E.g.: run all tests that are not in (a) certain category(s)? This is<br/>\n&gt;&gt; probably not difficult add in one way or another onto the concept of<br/>\n&gt;&gt; categories, but the answer to &quot;which test is now acctually included&quot; could<br/>\n&gt;&gt; become confusing in cases where a test is in an included and an excluded<br/>\n&gt;&gt; category. I would like to see something here that does not require a lot of<br/>\n&gt;&gt; browsing through hierarchies of suites nad categories. This may in my<br/>\n&gt;&gt; approach not well solved either as suites can extend on other suites: if a<br/>\n&gt;&gt; referenced suite includes a certain test, it is executed even if the<br/>\n&gt;&gt; extending suite excludes a test.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; And more fundamentally: is the idea/need of exclusion meaningfull or just a<br/>\n&gt;&gt; result of badly organising tests (I&#39;d say no, but I may be wrong)?<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; For what it&#39;s worth, excluding tests is a very popular TestNG features.  For<br/>\n&gt; example, I use it when a few tests are broken and need to remain so for a<br/>\n&gt; while:  I put them in the group &quot;broken&quot;, which I always exclude during my<br/>\n&gt; runs.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; When the time to ship approaches, I look at all the tests in the &quot;broken&quot;<br/>\n&gt; category and I go fix them then.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>For this particular use case, I&#39;ve found @Ignore generally useful.  I<br/>\nalso really love Kevin Lawrence&#39;s idea of marking tests with bug<br/>\nnumbers.  He does it like this:<br/>\n<br/>\n@Test public void shouldntDeleteAllTheUsersFiles() {<br/>\n  bug(34456);<br/>\n  ...<br/>\n}<br/>\n<br/>\nThe test only starts failing once bug 34456 is marked as fixed in the<br/>\nbug system.  Once we have failing assumptions working as they truly<br/>\nshould, this will be easy to implement on the JUnit side, although the<br/>\nbug-system integration would still be up to individual extenders or<br/>\nteams.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll this is to say that I do get the idea of excluded categories, but<br/>\nthis particular instance doesn&#39;t immediately convince me.<br/>\n<br/>\n   David Saff<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; --<br/>\n&gt; ***Cédric<br/>\n&gt; *<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Yahoo!
