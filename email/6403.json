This gives you the access you require.  It<br/>\n&gt; also provides other benefits, especially with TDD.  It makes managing<br/>\n&gt; the source a lot easier.  You only have to check in/out one file from<br/>\n&gt; SCM.  That way you never, ahem, forget the test code.  It&#39;s always<br/>\n&gt; married to the app code.  This helps enforce a mindset that the test<br/>\n&gt; code is just as important as the app code.  And it&#39;s really<br/>\n&gt; comfortable to bounce up and down the single file in your editor as<br/>\n&gt; you iterate between writing test code and app code.  Deployment is<br/>\n&gt; not a problem, since inner classes are compiled into seperate class<br/>\n&gt; files, using the AppClass$TestClass.class naming convention.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This sounds like a really great idea.<br/>\n<br/>\nI only recently became enamored of JUnit, as a result of JUnitDoclet&#39;s<br/>\ncreating a test framework for me. That shortened the JUnit learning<br/>\ncurve, which helped a lot.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m curious. Do you know of any IDEs that support this technique by<br/>\ngenerating static inner test classes?</div>",
