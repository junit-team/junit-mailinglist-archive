The problem is that it should NOT be \n&gt; looking in program files. I ha=\r\nve a j2sdk1.4.2_06 directory on my \n&gt; root C: drive and that is what I am r=\r\neferencing in my JAVA_HOME. I \n&gt; even went to what should be an unnecessart=\r\n step to add the tools.jar \n&gt; for this directory to my CLASSPATH property. =\r\nI am not using 1.5 yet \n&gt; since it has not been approved by the organizatio=\r\nn that I work for.\n&gt; \n&gt; Why when I specifically am pointing to this directo=\r\nry on JAVA_HOME \n&gt; and the CLASSPATH is it deciding to look in jre1.5.0_06&#92;=\r\nlib down \n&gt; under Program Files. It is obviously totally ignoring these \n&gt; =\r\nproperties and going on its own hunting expedition. The question is, \n&gt; how=\r\n can I get it to stop?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In junit@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Wayne Fay&quot; &lt;w=\r\naynefay@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Might be related to the space in &quot;Program Files&quot;? =\r\nI&#39;ve seen \n&gt; numerous\n&gt; &gt; bugs in Java apps due to spaces on Windows.\n&gt; &gt; \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; Perhaps reinstall JDK1.5 in a folder with no space?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; wf\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; On 5/11/06, whitworthjanet &lt;janet.e.whitworth@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Sorry for po=\r\nsting this question here, but I am trying to run ant \n&gt; at\n&gt; &gt; &gt; home so I =\r\ncan get a junit report and I can&#39;t get it to run.
