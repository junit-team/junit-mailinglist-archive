B. Rainsberger&quot; &lt;jbrains@...&gt;\nSubject: Re: Redirecting Test Output \n\n&gt;&gt; I have to test a series of previously written\n&gt;&gt; applications.  All of them use System.out and\n&gt;&gt; System.err to output data.  These applcations run\n&gt;&gt; either by themselves or under a JUnit suite i wrote. \n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; When running under JUnit, I would like to redirect the\n&gt;&gt; output of the applications to a log file, while STILL\n&gt;&gt; outputting my JUnit textUI.TestRunner results to the\n&gt;&gt; screen. \n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; any ideas how to do this?\n&gt;\n&gt; If the application uses the same streams as the test runner, then what\n&gt; you ask is impossible. \n&gt;\n&gt; The best you can do is customize the test runner (it&#39;s the path of least\n&gt; resistance) to send its output somewhere different, then redirect all\n&gt; standard output and standard error to files. You should be able to\n&gt; extend the textui TestRunner and override the ResultPrinter to print to\n&gt; a file, for example. Not too much work.\n\nI would like to point out that this kind of thing is very easy to do with\naspect-oriented programming (though I doubt that someone is willing to learn\nAspectJ just to do that). \n\nI already did something along those lines, using a few simple aspects.\nMany people are using it to develop &quot;development aspects&quot; such\nas these, even if they do not include aspects in production code.\nNot for nothing AspectJ is considered by some people as &quot;the ultimate \ntesting tool&quot;, though AspectJ is a lot more than that. \n\n\nMiguel Pessoa Monteiro\nPh.D. student at Minho University, Portugal\neMail: mmonteiro(at)di(dot)uminho(dot)pt\nURL: http://gec.di.uminho.pt/mpm/\n\n\n",
