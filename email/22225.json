There is no way to define an<br/>\n&gt; order, because in my experience independent tests are much more valuable<br/>\n&gt; than order-dependent tests.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Every time I&#39;ve had order dependencies I have had a problem with the design<br/>\n&gt; of the underlying system. Investing my available time in improving the<br/>\n&gt; design has had a much higher payoff than investing that same time into<br/>\n&gt; shuffling tests around.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI found that if the testing framework takes care of removing certain<br/>\npractical obstacles, dependent testing is actually very easy to implement<br/>\nand to use.  For example, if method c() depends on b() and a() and you only<br/>\nwant to run c(), you should be able to say &quot;run c()&quot; and the framework will<br/>\nfigure out which dependencies need to be run.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy experience with TestNG showed me that the fears often associated with<br/>\ntest dependencies are very overstated, and dependent testing is actually<br/>\nextremely useful for a lot of scenarios such as web testing (where<br/>\nnavigating from page to page adds state at each step, and having to recreate<br/>\nthat state from scratch would be very expensive).  Users of Selenium +<br/>\nTestNG with dependencies can probably make a good case at giving you more<br/>\ndetails on this.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Independent tests enable interesting transformations like parallel<br/>\n&gt; execution or the kind of dynamic reordering that let JUnit Max deliver<br/>\n&gt; failures more quickly.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nDependencies and parallelism are actually not mutually exclusive at all.<br/>\n Here are a couple of articles I wrote that describe the multithreaded<br/>\ntopological sort algorithm that I implemented in TestNG:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://beust.com/weblog/archives/000535.html\">http://beust.com/weblog/archives/000535.html</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://beust.com/weblog/archives/000536.html\">http://beust.com/weblog/archives/000536.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\nThis should be especially of interest to developers interested in hard<br/>\nconcurrency issues, but all this complexity is completely hidden away from<br/>\nusers.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith TestNG, you specify your dependencies (e.g. &quot;@Test(dependsOnMethods =<br/>\n&quot;f&quot;)), then your thread pool size (thread-pool-size=15) and TestNG will<br/>\nfigure out how to run all your tests (both dependent and non dependent ones)<br/>\nin the most efficient parallel manner by using the threads you supplied as<br/>\nwell as possible.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n***Cédric<br/>\n*<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed] </span></blockquote></div>",
