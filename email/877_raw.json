The main problem with this is hooking it into\nJUnit&#39;s test runner -- that involves some minor hacking.  Alternately,\nyou could define your own junit.framework.TestSuite with the desired\nsemantics and place it before JUnit in your classpath; the test runners\nshould then use your version of the class instead.\n\n--Sameer\n\n&gt; I&#39;ve been relying upon the undocumented behavior in JUnit&#39;s reflection\n&gt; support.  Reflection seems to return methods based on their order within\n&gt; the class file, and JUnit&#39;s Result stores failures in a vector.\n&gt; Vector&#39;s elements() method is documented as returning the contents in\n&gt; vector order.\n&gt; \n&gt; So, basically, I write my tests in order, simplest first, most complex\n&gt; last, and it comes out in the right order if I use have JUnit use\n&gt; reflection to identify the test methods.\n&gt; \n&gt; Naturally, if Kent or Erich change the Result class, I&#39;m hosed.\n&gt; \n&gt; If you wanted to do this &quot;right&quot;, you could extend TestRunner and\n&gt; replace printFailures() with a version which sorts the enumeration based\n&gt; on whatever criteria you like.  Method name comes to mind as something\n&gt; easy to use.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Personnally I&#39;m not even sure it&#39;s worth it, but I wanted to share\n&gt; &gt; that idea with people on the list.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Oh, I think it&#39;s worth it.  The last time I brought it up I got\n&gt; flamed. :p I hope you fare better than I did.\n\n",
