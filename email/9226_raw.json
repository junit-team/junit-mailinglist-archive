Here is my\np=\r\nroposed solution:\n\nFor CustomerTest XTest, I&#39;ll create a constructor like X=\r\nTest(name, host,\nport) which will call super(name), store host and port.\nFo=\r\nr XTest.suite(), I&#39;ll check to see if host is &#39;localhost&#39; (or\n127.0.0.1) - =\r\nif it is, start my local HTTP server (via a TestSetup\nextension) with the s=\r\net port (default value already applied).  If the\nhost is not localhost, I&#39;l=\r\nl simply skip the TestSetup and return the\nsuite.\n\nIn my super class, which=\r\n handles communication via HTTP to the server\n(local or otherwise), it will=\r\n simply use the set host and port which was\neither the default (localhost:r=\r\nandomport) or the provided host and port.\n\nI can then setup a wrapper class=\r\n for my CustomerTests, CustTestY.  When\nI build my suite I can do something=\r\n like:\n\n  ...\n  remoteHost =3D [some default host];\n  remotePort =3D [defau=\r\nlt port on remoteHost]\n\n  public static Test suite() {\n    TestSuite s =3D =\r\nnew TestSuite();\n    s.addTest(new XTest(remoteHost, remotePort);\n  }\n\n  pu=\r\nblic static void main(String[] args) {\n    ... If there are args...\n    rem=\r\noteHost =3D arg[1];\n    remotePort =3D arg[2];\n    ...\n    junit.textui.Tes=\r\ntRunner.run(suite());\n  }\n\nThis would then allow me to run the wrapper clas=\r\ns with a default, or\ngiven (via commandline), host and port to point at.\n\nI=\r\ns this the best approach for me?  Is my logic flawed?  My apologies in\nadva=\r\nnce for not just hammering it out, but this is unfortunately a bit\nof a bac=\r\nkground thought process for me while I clean up other tests and\nI just want=\r\ned to bounce the idea off the list (for lack of another\nsuitable &#39;pair&#39;) fi=\r\nrst.\n\nThanks in advance,\n\nTom\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: Thomas Robb=\r\ns \nSent: August 27, 2003 9:28 AM\nTo: junit@yahoogroups.com\nSubject: [junit]=\r\n HTTP Testing - Local and Remote\n\n\n\nGreetings...\n\nI&#39;m finding myself in a s=\r\nituation where I would like to create the\nfollowing type of test case:\n\n- t=\r\nesting a web service via HTTP\n- default testing of the service would requir=\r\ne that the HTTP server is\nstarted up on the local machine\n- an additional w=\r\nay of executing the test would be to have the same HTTP\nbased tests execute=\r\n against an assumed host/port that is already running\nthe HTTP server w/ th=\r\ne service.\n\nWe&#39;re currently using XmlTestCase as the base class for an Http=\r\nTestCase.\nThe former handles the XML that is returned from the service and =\r\nthe\nlater handles getting the response to and from the server to our tests.=\r\n\nI currently use an extension of TestSetup to setup the HTTP server for\nthe=\r\n &quot;default test execution&quot;.\n\nI&#39;m not sure how to proceed.  I&#39;d assume that I=\r\n may need to create my\nown TestRunner to perform the &quot;execute tests against=\r\n remote server&quot;\napproach.  I don&#39;t want to go down a rat hole on this as I =\r\nthink there\nis a chunk of basic Junit knowledge that I&#39;m missing out on as =\r\nto how to\nbest set up this pattern.\n\nCan anyone lend a hand or point me at =\r\nsome examples of solutions that\nfix similar problems?\n\nThanks in advance,\n\n=\r\nTom\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\nYahoo!
