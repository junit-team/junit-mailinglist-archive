My feeling is that it is the *later* as I attended a presentation on<br/>\ndeveloper testing by Jeff from Agitar and there was very little talk of the<br/>\ntool.  Possibly the misunderstanding came from local marketing and local<br/>\ninexperience?<br/>\n<br/>\nWhenever we have been discussing developer testing here I get the impression<br/>\nthat some think the tool will solve the problems for them ... it will do the<br/>\n&#39;&quot;testing&quot;.  I (and others) have been reiterating that developer testing is<br/>\nan attitude and usually requires a change in culture more than a change in<br/>\ntoolset.<br/>\n<br/>\nRegards<br/>\nShane<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",
