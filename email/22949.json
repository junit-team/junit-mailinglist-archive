It seams that the<br/>\n&#39;specification&#39; was a one time ejection of the ant team. I think (but<br/>\ni´m not sure) that no one is responsable at the moment. I agree to David<br/>\nSaff that the JUnit team is not responsable for the &#39;specification&#39;.<br/>\n<br/>\nI strongly want to move the &#39;unit test result format&#39; to the next level.<br/>\nI think my next step should be to contact the ant team as they are the<br/>\nlegal &#39;copyright owner&#39; (in the open source meaning) of the<br/>\nXMLJUnitResultFormatter code. The XMLJUnitResultFormatter code (and<br/>\nrelated documents) are the only &#39;official source&#39; of the<br/>\n&#39;specification&#39;. I will ask them if the support my idea and how to continue.<br/>\n<br/>\nAny suggestions who to contact and how to contact ?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Or is this a request for some JUnit mailing list follower&#39;s input<br/>\n&gt; into the process?<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Year, would be great if i get impulse from the community to keep on<br/>\ngoing. But at least your thoughts about it and your ideas can help me a<br/>\nlot. It will be wonderful if i get some combatants.<br/>\n<br/>\nBest regards<br/>\nDaniela Waranie</div>",
