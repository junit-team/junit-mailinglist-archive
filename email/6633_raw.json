So hopefully that helps \nmore people than just myself. \n\n\n\n\n&lt;end of relevant discussion&gt;\n\n\n\n\n&lt;offline&gt;\n\n\nAs for the rest of the overhead...\n\n\n\n\n    A search of google is where the quest began. My description of it \nbeing quick was more to cover the fact that there was a possibility \nthat I could have overlooked something. So yes a suggestion of \nsomething fairly obvious is rather grating/annoying and not helpful. \nPerhaps also it was more the phrasing. But I digress... \n\n\n    I figured this audience was the next most likely place to find a \ngroup if one existed considering the overlap in audience between the \ntools. I didn&#39;t expected more than a curteous response. But alas such \nis the joy of the internet. In any event it is in the past and the \nanswer was found.\n\n\n\n\n--- In junit@yahoogroups.com, &quot;J. B.
