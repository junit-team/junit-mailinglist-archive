I see this to be very critical for <br/>\nmethods failing and resulting in exceptions. this way user could <br/>\nsimultaniously say what is related message resulting failure along <br/>\nwith the exact stack trace.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, junit does not give the cound of no of test cases passed.. it <br/>\nsays total, failed and errors only.. would be happy to see total <br/>\npassed and its % to encourage people to work on fixing others.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother need, which I had been badly looking for was no of asserts <br/>\nwhich have been executed.. this tells me how much of auto testing <br/>\nhas been done.<br/>\n<br/>\ni.e assertEquals() assertNotNull all these calls should have a way <br/>\nreport to total assertcounter.<br/>\n<br/>\nRegards,<br/>\nRaja Nagendra Kumar,<br/>\nC.T.O<br/>\nwww.tejasoft.com<br/>\n-Competant and Reliable Offshore Java Code Audit, Refactoring and <br/>\nTest Automation Prodcut development Partners.</div>",
