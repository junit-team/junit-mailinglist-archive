I&#39;m sure you can\neasily find similar code in y=\r\nour own applications (two ifs, two booleans in\neach if and a try/catch).\n\nE=\r\nach branch multiplies the number of code paths by two, and that&#39;s not even\n=\r\ntaking exceptions into account, which add multipliers of their own.\n\nThe bo=\r\nttom line is that in average, I would expect that a typical Java\nmethod pro=\r\nbably requires 10-20 test cases to be 100% branch covered, hence\nmy belief =\r\nthat trying to achieve this number is not just a bad idea, it&#39;s\nunprofessio=\r\nnal :-)\n\n-- \nC=C3=A9dric\nhttp://testng.org\n\n\nOn 1/3/07, Mike Bria &lt;bria526x=\r\np@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; On 1/3/07, C=C3=A9dric Beust =E2=99=94 &lt;cbeust@goog=\r\nle.com&gt; wrote:\n&gt; {snip}\n&gt; &gt;  Consider the following simple code:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  p=\r\nublic URL createUrl(int a, int b) {\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  try {\n&gt; &gt;    if (a =3D=3D 0 ||=\r\n b =3D=3D 0) {\n&gt; &gt;    }\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  if (c =3D=3D 0 && d =3D=3D 0) {\n&gt; &gt;    }\n&gt;=\r\n &gt;  }\n&gt; &gt;  catch(IOException ex) {\n&gt; &gt;  }\n&gt; &gt;  catch(MalformedURLException =\r\nex) {\n&gt; &gt;  }\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Do you really feel it&#39;s useful to write 16 test cases f=\r\nor these 6\n&gt; lines of code?\n&gt;\n&gt; Cedric --\n&gt;\n&gt; I don&#39;t quite understand your=\r\n example.
