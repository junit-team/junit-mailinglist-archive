Unit tests often test the interplay of two or\n&gt;    three\n&gt;    &gt; methods, or even of several objects. You can&#39;t do this (effectively)\n&gt;    &gt; with embedded assertions.\n&gt;    If you use Design by Contract then the implementation can be checked\n&gt;    by\n&gt;    the compiler to be valid or not. No JUnit needed. Focus on writing\n&gt;    proper contracts instead of proper tests.\n\nThis is an uneducated statement -- why don&#39;t you spend some time learning\nwhat testing is about before making these assumptions!  The compiler is\nactually on one kind of test.\n\n&gt;    &gt; Do you have a pointer?\n&gt;    I don&#39;t know what you mean.\n\nI think he meant do you have a POINT...\n\n&gt;    &gt; That&#39;s wrong, as others already stated.\n&gt;    But how will you test a method which returns nothing?\n\nAs was said before, check the state the system is in before and after\ncalling the method.  For example, return a DB connection to a Pool. \nCheck the DB pool to make sure the connection is there.\n\n&gt;    &gt; Asserts are even less a guarantee. Asserts need to be executed to be\n&gt;    &gt; effective - if you don&#39;t have external code invoking them in a well\n&gt;    &gt; directed manner, they will not be of any use until in the production\n&gt;    &gt; environment.\n&gt;    In my following posting I favor Design by Contract instead of just\n&gt;    using\n&gt;    assert statements. I replied to myself. Read the thread when it\n&gt;    appears.\n&gt;    &gt; If you really prefer this way, it wouldn&#39;t be too hard to include\n&gt;    the\n&gt;    &gt; unit tests into your production code. Most people seem to prefer to\n&gt;    &gt; seperate the two.\n&gt;    I prefer Design by Contract. Most people don&#39;t know that paradigma.\n\nMany of us here are quite familiar with DBC -- again you make uneducated\nassumptions.\n\n&gt;    &gt; Junit doesn&#39;t force you to develop test-driven at all.\n&gt;    It suggests it strongy I think. Otherwise the synchronisation of code\n&gt;    and test is endangered.\n\nThe ASSUMPTION you make here would be nice if it were true, however, it\nis not.  You obviously don&#39;t quite understand TDD/TFD.  Go study some\nmore.\n\n&gt;    &gt; You might fear that it is. In practice, it doesn&#39;t seem to be that\n&gt;    way.\n&gt;    If you use TDD in its intended form than you lose time. Thats my\n&gt;    opinion.\n\nIt would be better to back it up with real experience.  I have done a lot\nof development, using a lot of approaches and methodologies.  I\npersonally have found myself to go MUCH faster with TDD.  But I won&#39;t\ntake the time to belabor this point until you do more of your own\nhomework, or ask intelligent questions instead of throwing out these\nridiculously unfounded _opinions_!\n\n&gt;    &gt; minutes. There are even tools to automate this. My IDE shows me\n&gt;    wether I\n&gt;    &gt; run the tests since the last code change, and an integration server\n&gt;    &gt; emails me if I broke a test nevertheless.\n&gt;    Still much work. I prefer to concentrate on code and not on test\n&gt;    quality.\n\nI believe that most folks who understand unit testing would agree that\nfocusing on test quality IS focusing on &quot;code&quot; -- it sounds like you are\njust LAZY!\n\n&gt;    &gt; So, did that help?\n&gt;    Yes.\n&gt;    Using Design by Contract is in a way a medium between implementation\n&gt;    and\n&gt;    tests. It is not as abstract as the implementation but not so\n&gt;    concrete\n&gt;    as the tests. Read my second thread (I replied to myself).\n\nI could really flame you here, but I think I have said enough.\n\n=jason\n=jason\n[:question | ^One]\n\n",
