If you  <br/>\nHAVE tested the code then you know that it passes your tests.  No  <br/>\nemployer is paying you to guess as to whether the code works.  Your  <br/>\nemployer is paying you to be as certain as you can be that the code  <br/>\nworks.  The only way to do that is to write tests, and to write them  <br/>\n*before* you write the code.  Writing tests after the fact is far  <br/>\nless effective because the code was almost certainly not written to  <br/>\nbe testable.<br/>\n<br/>\n----<br/>\nRobert C.
