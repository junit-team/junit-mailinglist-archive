My experience is that private methods are frequently\n&gt;introduced specifically to remove duplication. \n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\nPrivate methods reduce duplication within the one class. They do nothing \nto reduce duplication within the entire system. Extracting them to \npublic methods on an appropriate class does.\n\nConsider a method to parse a String into a Calendar. This is boiler \nplate code. Do it a few times in a class, and you&#39;ll end up making a \nprivate method. However, when Jane over there wants to turn a String \ninto a Calendar in a different class, she doesn&#39;t know about the private \nmethod you wrote - because it&#39;s _private_.\n\nPrivate methods are the most common violator of the \nSingle-Responsibility Principle, in my experience. Wanting to test them \nis a symptom, to me, of a violation of the SRP.  Exposing private \nmethods as public, on an appropriate class, helps me to avoid \nSRP-violations, and helps promote reuse to reduce duplication.\n\nThe other driver I have to make private methods public is explicitly to \nreduce duplication. For example, maybe it&#39;s you doing the \nString-to-Calendar trick in another class. You know where you did it \nbefore, so you extract it out and reuse it. However, this only works \nbecause you&#39;re familar with what you did earlier - it didn&#39;t work for \nJane because she wasn&#39;t.\n\nRobert.\n\n\n-- \n               &quot;Software is too expensive to build cheaply&quot;\nRobert Watkins         http://twasink.net/          robertdw@...\n\n\n",
