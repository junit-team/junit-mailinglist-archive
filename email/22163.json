Have you<br/>\nconsidered using evil reflection tricks to change the private state of<br/>\nthe class under test after load time?<br/>\n<br/>\n   David Saff<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Wed, Dec 9, 2009 at 3:17 PM, Bill Shannon &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Bill.Shannon@...\">Bill.Shannon@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve read the FAQ and the javadocs and done much web searching but can&#39;t find<br/>\n&gt; an answer to this.  Sorry if this is stupid question.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I need to write a test case that tests a class whose behavior depends on<br/>\n&gt; a System property.  The class reads the System property at class initialization<br/>\n&gt; time.  I&#39;d like to have multiple test cases, each of which sets a different<br/>\n&gt; value for the System property, so each of the tests needs to be run in a<br/>\n&gt; separate JVM or possibly a separate ClassLoader.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Is there a simple way to (e.g.) annotate my test case to cause JUnit to<br/>\n&gt; handle this for me?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m invoking JUnit as part of a maven build.  Note that I don&#39;t want to<br/>\n&gt; run *all* of my JUnit tests in a single separate JVM, I want to run<br/>\n&gt; certain test cases each in their own separate JVM (or ClassLoader).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; If I have to start a new JVM or create a new ClassLoader myself, what&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; the best way to initialize the CLASSPATH and find the class to be tested<br/>\n&gt; from within a JUnit test case running under maven?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thanks.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Yahoo!
