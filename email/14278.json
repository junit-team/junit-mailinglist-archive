Unless some new assertions are available - <br/>\nAssert#assertException or Assert#assertInstanceOf, for example - I don&#39;t <br/>\nthink the introduction of a new class is justified on the basis of <br/>\naltering which Exception it uses to indicate a failed assertion.<br/>\n<br/>\nElliotte Harold wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Alexandru Popescu wrote:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;&gt;As far as I can tell I think that the new Assert class was created to remove the custom <br/>\n&gt;&gt;AssertionException and use the AssertionException provided since JDK1.4. From my point of view this <br/>\n&gt;&gt;is definitely a very good reason to have it.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; OK. I can see that, but I think that&#39;s a very bad idea. A JUnit <br/>\n&gt; assertion test failure is not at all the same thing as a Java language <br/>\n&gt; assert failure. They are two different things and they should be <br/>\n&gt; distinguishable. Failure to do that might cause unexpected problems with <br/>\n&gt; various tools that interpret an AssertionError as meaning one thing when <br/>\n&gt; JUnit makes it mean something different.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>-- <br/>\nStephen Smith, MEng (Wales).<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.stephen-smith.co.uk/\">http://www.stephen-smith.co.uk/</a></div>",
