Fortunately for me, granularity is not an issue because I\nam mutating the entire execution context.\n\nThis brings up a question that I&#39;ve been pondering: Given a test T, which of\nthe following two choices is more desirable?\n   o Enable profiling for T by specifying some preference and let the\nexecution framework do the rest.\n   o Enable profiling for T by coding a new test Tp that decorates T with\nprofiling. When you want to run T with profiling you run Tp. When you want\nto run T without it you just run T. This is very similar to the way\nJUnitPerf works.\n\nMike Clark Wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Michael Silverstein wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Wrapping test execution\n&gt; &gt; -----------------------\n&gt; &gt; I need to be able to start profiling immediately before a user\n&gt; test starts\n&gt; &gt; and end profiling immediately afterward. One approach is to\n&gt; wrap the user\n&gt; &gt; test class that is presently instantiated in\n&gt; &gt; junit.runner.BaseTestRunner.getTest(String) with a\n&gt; TestDecorator subclass\n&gt; &gt; instance that manages profiling during test execution. Creating the\n&gt; &gt; decorator sounds like a job for factory method [Gamma95].\n&gt;\n&gt; JUnitPerf attempts to something similar - start a timer\n&gt; immediately before the\n&gt; test executes and stop the timer immediately after the test\n&gt; completes.  However,\n&gt; the granularity of test decoration offered by the TestDecorator\n&gt; includes the\n&gt; time associated with setting up and tearing down the test\n&gt; fixture.  In other\n&gt; words, decorating the Test.run() method includes the overhead of\n&gt; setUp() and\n&gt; tearDown().\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;m not sure how you&#39;re defining profiling, but I wanted to make\n&gt; you were aware\n&gt; of the implications of decoration and how it relates to the life\n&gt; cycle of test\n&gt; execution.\n&gt;\n&gt; Mike\n&gt;\n&gt; --\n&gt; Mike Clark\n&gt; Clarkware Consulting, Inc.\n&gt; http://www.clarkware.com\n&gt; 720.851.2014\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
