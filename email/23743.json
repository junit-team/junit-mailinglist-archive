I think that<br/>\ngetTestClass(), getMethodName() and getClassName() are currently<br/>\nimplemented wrong: see <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://github.com/KentBeck/junit/issues/198\">https://github.com/KentBeck/junit/issues/198</a><br/>\nfor how I&#39;d rather approach it.  In short, I&#39;d like for Description to<br/>\nremain a serializeable, final, value class, but allow for custom<br/>\nRunners to have full control over what data gets put into that value<br/>\nstructure.  Would that work for you?  If so, want to produce a patch<br/>\nfor this?<br/>\n<br/>\nSeparate from this are the problems that arise from Description<br/>\ncontaining both the test structure graph, and the metadata for each<br/>\nnode in that graph, but that doesn&#39;t seem to be your current<br/>\nchallenge.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the subject of error messages for Assume.*:  Oops.  :-)  Patches<br/>\ndefinitely welcome.<br/>\n<br/>\n   David Saff<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Thu, Oct 27, 2011 at 5:05 PM, Dawid Weiss &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dawid.weiss@...\">dawid.weiss@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; Hi everyone.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; My name is Dawid Weiss, I&#39;m a committer to Apache Lucene/Solr. Lucene<br/>\n&gt; and Solr use a custom runner to randomize test execution extensively.<br/>\n&gt; This works great and I&#39;ve decided to try to pull a custom JUnit runner<br/>\n&gt; out of Lucene so that it can be reused without relying on the rest of<br/>\n&gt; Lucene&#39;s infrastructure. So... I wrote a custom runner and on the way<br/>\n&gt; I came across a problem: I would really like to have a hierarchy of<br/>\n&gt; Descriptions to indicate something meaningful, in particular contain<br/>\n&gt; the random seed for a suite group, then for individual tests, etc. I<br/>\n&gt; believe a similar situation could also be useful for<br/>\n&gt; ParameterizedRunner...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Unfortunately, the problem is that Description is sealed and does not<br/>\n&gt; allow much in terms of flexibility (the constructor is private, static<br/>\n&gt; factory methods).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The design of this class leads me to believe that Description should<br/>\n&gt; be a contract (interface or a class, but with the possibility of<br/>\n&gt; subclassing) so that getDisplayName() returns something meaningful (as<br/>\n&gt; in the example above), but getTestClass(), getMethodName() and<br/>\n&gt; getClassName() can still point IDEs and report writers to the right<br/>\n&gt; place. Or at least allow a custom display name not related to the<br/>\n&gt; method name/ class of the test case?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Another burning issue we have in Lucene is that Assume.* methods don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; take any explanation message. Why is this so? I mean: an assumption<br/>\n&gt; can fail, but just like with failures it&#39;d be nice to be actually able<br/>\n&gt; to explain why a given assumption wasn&#39;t met...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Let me know what you think. I can provide a patch (several ones :),<br/>\n&gt; but I wanted to hear what people think first.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Dawid<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Yahoo!
