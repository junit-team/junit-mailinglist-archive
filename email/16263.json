They point out that TestCase, like key<br/>\nabstractions in many mature frameworks, has a high pattern density,<br/>\nmaking it easy to use but hard to change. In this installment of the<br/>\nAOP@Work series, Wes Isberg revisits the Cook&#39;s Tour and shows you how<br/>\nusing AOP pointcuts rather than object-oriented designs can help you<br/>\navoid some of the pattern density that makes mature designs hard to<br/>\nchange.\t\t\t\t\t\t<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe author further goes on to state that:<br/>\n<br/>\nIn this article, I walk through the design presented by Erich Gamma<br/>\nand Kent                                                             <br/>\n    Beck in &quot;JUnit: A Cook&#39;s Tour&quot; (see the Resources section). For<br/>\neach Java       pattern they present, I propose an AspectJ alternative<br/>\nand evaluate how it satisfies some of these canonical design goals:\t\t\t\t\t<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www-128.ibm.com/developerworks/java/library/j-aopwork7/index.html\">http://www-128.ibm.com/developerworks/java/library/j-aopwork7/index.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers,<br/>\nVivek Oswal</div>",
