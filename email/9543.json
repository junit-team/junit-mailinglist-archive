You run them under exactly the same conditions.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow in this case, I was actually being kind to Java.  I ignored the<br/>\nstartup time.  Had I done &quot;fairer&quot; tests, C++ would have outperformed<br/>\nJava by a much wider margin.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut the tests were absurdly biased to begin with.  They were about as<br/>\nbiased as possible towards removing all of the effects being discussed.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; To have a smaller footprint try -Xms1m.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>In the context of the discussion you are replying to, to have a smaller<br/>\nfootprint, run the Java through JAX.  This will reduce the code size by<br/>\n60-70%.  That will reduce your load time and memory footprint by a similar<br/>\namount and have, I believe, a similar effect on execution time.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJim Dixon  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jdd@...\">jdd@...</a>   tel +44 117 982 0786  mobile +44 797 373 7881</div>",
