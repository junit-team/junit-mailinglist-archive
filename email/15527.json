I have never cared about this, <br/>\nso I&#39;m surprised when so many other people do care about it. Either <br/>\nthey&#39;re missing something simple, or I&#39;m missing something simple.<br/>\n<br/>\nLet&#39;s say I want to know which tests cover a given production code <br/>\nmethod. To do that, I go to the method, then hit Shift+Ctrl+G in <br/>\nEclipse, searching the workspace for references to that method. It&#39;s <br/>\nusually pretty easy to scan the list of search results and separate the <br/>\ntest case classes (which have the word &quot;Test&quot; in them) from the <br/>\nproduction code classes (which don&#39;t have the word &quot;Test&quot; in them). This <br/>\ntechnique has never posed a serious enough problem for me to want to do <br/>\nit a different way.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have used the same technique with IntelliJ IDEA, so it&#39;s not just an <br/>\nEclipse thing.<br/>\n<br/>\nI can also do the same thing if I want to see which tests use the <br/>\n/class/, but I can&#39;t remember the last time I wanted to know that. I <br/>\ntypically want to know which tests are using a /method/, not a class.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo would anyone like to tell us a story of when they needed to search <br/>\nfor the tests that cover a given production code class, and how <br/>\norganizing their tests their way made that easy? I&#39;d like to learn what <br/>\nthe big issues are.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks.<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJ. B.
