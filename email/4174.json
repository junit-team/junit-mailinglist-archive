But that&#39;s just my style.  It sounds as if your team has decided otherwise, and that&#39;s cool.  Let us know how it goes.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; What I meant to say was:<br/>\n&gt; 2. Tests do *not* show intention of the method, just the *current*<br/>\n&gt; implementation.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; That is, if the tests document the method, what they are documenting is the<br/>\n&gt; current implementation of that method, not the intention.<br/>\n&gt; Then it follows that order to find and fix a bug, you must admit the<br/>\n&gt; &quot;documentation&quot; is incorrect, not the implementation.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I agree that unit tests do in fact test the current implementation of a method, though the tests have no specific knowledge of that implementation.  By refactoring, we can change the implementation of the method without breaking or invalidating the tests.  Tests document the intended use of the method, from the client code&#39;s perspective.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo find and fix a bug we must admit that the tests are inadequate.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; okay .. getting a bit deep here - back to hacking away with vi ;-)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Then I&#39;ll leave you with this final thought:  If we design software by writing tests first, do the tests document the intention of the software, or its implementation?<br/>\n<br/>\nRegards,<br/>\n<br/>\nMike<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nMike Clark<br/>\nClarkware Consulting, Inc.<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.clarkware.com\">http://www.clarkware.com</a><br/>\n720.851.2014</div>",
