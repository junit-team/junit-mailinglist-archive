I don&#39;t even remember anyone suggesting to <br/>\n&gt; use statically typed groups either (if ever), so there <br/>\n&gt; doesn&#39;t seem to really be a problem there.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Well, since we&#39;re enriching the discussion with input from our<br/>\nfavorite projects, I&#39;ll follow suit. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nNUnit has used string categories for a long time without serious<br/>\nproblems. Two minor problems have come up, which one might want<br/>\nto keep in mind:<br/>\n<br/>\n1) Some folks would prefer to use enumerations, for reasons<br/>\nof type safety. To support this, CategoryAttribute has<br/>\na protected constructor that allows folks to create<br/>\na derived attribute (e.g. FastAttribute) that sets the<br/>\ninternal string category to whatever is wanted. Ultimately,<br/>\nsince categories are used in the command line, we need<br/>\na string anyway.<br/>\n<br/>\n2) We support category expressions on the command line,<br/>\nusing a limited operator syntax. Unfortunately, the<br/>\noperators include &#39;-&#39; which many people tend to use in<br/>\ntheir category identifiers. This leads to situations where<br/>\nthe category specification appears to be ignored. If<br/>\nI were starting over, I would use space-delimited <br/>\nkey words, that is...<br/>\n  &quot;fast and not database&quot;<br/>\nrather than...<br/>\n  &quot;fast-database&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nDifferences in how attributes are defined and used in<br/>\nJava and C# mean that the above is probably not directly <br/>\nuseful, but it may lead to some further ideas.<br/>\n <br/>\nCharlie</div>",
