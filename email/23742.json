    "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-552720506\">Hi everyone.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy name is Dawid Weiss, I&#39;m a committer to Apache Lucene/Solr. Lucene<br/>\nand Solr use a custom runner to randomize test execution extensively.<br/>\nThis works great and I&#39;ve decided to try to pull a custom JUnit runner<br/>\nout of Lucene so that it can be reused without relying on the rest of<br/>\nLucene&#39;s infrastructure. So... I wrote a custom runner and on the way<br/>\nI came across a problem: I would really like to have a hierarchy of<br/>\nDescriptions to indicate something meaningful, in particular contain<br/>\nthe random seed for a suite group, then for individual tests, etc. I<br/>\nbelieve a similar situation could also be useful for<br/>\nParameterizedRunner...<br/>\n<br/>\nUnfortunately, the problem is that Description is sealed and does not<br/>\nallow much in terms of flexibility (the constructor is private, static<br/>\nfactory methods).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe design of this class leads me to believe that Description should<br/>\nbe a contract (interface or a class, but with the possibility of<br/>\nsubclassing) so that getDisplayName() returns something meaningful (as<br/>\nin the example above), but getTestClass(), getMethodName() and<br/>\ngetClassName() can still point IDEs and report writers to the right<br/>\nplace. Or at least allow a custom display name not related to the<br/>\nmethod name/ class of the test case?<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother burning issue we have in Lucene is that Assume.* methods don&#39;t<br/>\ntake any explanation message. Why is this so? I mean: an assumption<br/>\ncan fail, but just like with failures it&#39;d be nice to be actually able<br/>\nto explain why a given assumption wasn&#39;t met...<br/>\n<br/>\nLet me know what you think. I can provide a patch (several ones :),<br/>\nbut I wanted to hear what people think first.<br/>\n<br/>\nDawid</div>",
