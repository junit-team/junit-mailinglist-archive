Test First means that very few of my methods are\nprivate, and I really don&#39;t see this as a bad thing.  (Most of the ones that\nare private are there only because that&#39;s what Eclipses&#39; Extract Method\nrefactoring does).\n\nNB:  That is not the same as making private methods public for testing\npurposes.  That should be avoided at all \n\n&gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; From: Chirag Shashikant Doshi [mailto:chirag.doshi@...] \n&gt; Sent: 16 October 2003 04:02\n&gt; To: junit@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Subject: RE: [junit] Re: How to test private methods, its urgent\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Hi Michael\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; Personally, I don&#39;t believe in private methods. I&#39;d rather make\n&gt; evrything\n&gt; public and testable and expose real APIs via Java Interfaces.\n&gt; \n&gt; I don&#39;t understand what exactly you mean by this, please \n&gt; elaborate or could you lead me to a place where I can see \n&gt; some examples of the above.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks\n&gt; Chirag\n&gt; \n&gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; From: Michael Silverstein [mailto:msilverstein@...] \n&gt; Sent: Wednesday, October 15, 2003 11:07 PM\n&gt; To: junit@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Subject: RE: [junit] Re: How to test private methods, its urgent\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; &gt; From: Dave Astels [mailto:dave@...]\n&gt; &gt; Private methods support public methods.  Therefore well \n&gt; tested public \n&gt; &gt; methods will include the behaviour of the private methods.  \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; There is no real reason for directly testing private methods.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Domain objects support the GUI. By the logic above a well \n&gt; tested GUI will include the behavior of the domain objects, \n&gt; so there is no reason to unit test the domain objects :-)\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;ve occasionally found reason to write unit tests for \n&gt; private, supporting methods. Often you loose efficiency \n&gt; testing supporting methods indirectly via their caller - such \n&gt; as in the case where you want to test their ability to \n&gt; properly handle a range of input values. \n&gt; \n&gt; Personally, I don&#39;t believe in private methods. I&#39;d rather \n&gt; make everything public and testable and expose real APIs via \n&gt; Java Interfaces.\n&gt; \n&gt; To answer the original poster: google junit + &quot;private methods&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; Outgoing mail is certified Virus Free.\n&gt; Checked by AVG anti-virus system (http://www.grisoft.com).\n&gt; Version: 6.0.522 / Virus Database: 320 - Release Date: 9/29/2003\n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to: \n&gt; junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
