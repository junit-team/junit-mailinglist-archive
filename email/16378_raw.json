It tests knowledge\n&gt; of things that aren&#39;t JUnit, inadequately tests things\n&gt; are ARE JUnit, and considers opinions as facts.  Plus,\n&gt; many of the questions are posed in such weak English\n&gt; that they are ambiguous and confusing.  Or maybe to be\n&gt; a &quot;Java Black Belt&quot; you must surpass such trivia.\n\nI failed my beta test. Enough said, but I want to say more.\n\nThe answer to the question &quot;Test Driven Design&quot; (#4387) is laughably \nwrong. It might suffice for a beginner practitioner, but otherwise it&#39;s \nwoefully inadequate.\n\nThe answer to question #4383 (throwing exceptions) is absurd, since \nthere&#39;s no indication which conditions of the call to doOperation() \nmight throw which exception. The explanation is one person&#39;s opinion, \nand misses the point:\n\n&quot;The only way to test properly that certain exceptions have been thrown \nis using variables. When more than one exception may be thrown, then it \nbecomes hard to understand the code if it simple says &#39;fail&#39;.&quot;\n\nThis is only true if you&#39;re trying to test for different expected \nexceptions in the same test. Who the hell does that?!\n\nIt doesn&#39;t serve the community to project oneself as authoritative when \nthere is obvious literature out there that contradicts the answers to \nthis questions. For such a quiz, stick to answers that can be verified \nby running code and leave the opinion stuff out.\n\nTake care.\n-- \nJ. B.
