(BTW: If you want to really teach OO, why not use\nSmalltalk?  Squeak is free and fantastic! -- Sorry for the shameless\nplug.)\n\nI just did a quick &quot;trawl&quot; through blueJ (not very impressed I must\nsay!).  If it&#39;s open source, it shouldn&#39;t be hard to integrate JUnit. \nAll you would need to do is implement a sub-menu to the Tools menu or\nsomething that would allow you to execute a TestRunner (most likely in\nanother VM).  The real key is whether or not you can get the source.\n\nActually, I think that Eric&#39;s suggestion is a valid one for this &quot;IDE&quot;\n(if it can be called that).  If you are really concerned about\nclasspaths and other issues that happen to be inherit in Java (and while\nyou are teaching Java, why not teach about its &#39;issues&#39;), you could\neasily write a script that would run tests for them, setting up the\nclasspath auto-magically.  Heck, you could even write a little app or\nscript that will download it for them, install it to the directory of\nthe students choice, set the environment variables, and then generate\nthe build.xml for them.  That would at most take a day to do something\nso simple (unless you are running on Mac or Windows, then it&#39;s easily\n1.5 days). :)  There are many solutions to your problem, choose the one\nwith which you are most comfortable.\n\n=jason\n\nOn Tue, 2002-07-16 at 09:26, daviddench wrote: --- In junit@y..., Eric\nHeikkila &lt;ericheikkila@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Regardless of whether it&#39;s built in or not, it&#39;s\n&gt; fairly easy to use JUnit.

I am familiar with JUnit, but the criteria\nhere is not to overload this particular group of students too quickly.\nI want to use the very simple BlueJ environment to nanny the students\n( for a variety of reasons ) but also introduce unit testing very\nquickly via TDD. It would be nicer if UT was relatively seamless at \nfirst. \n\n      David\n\n\n\nYahoo!
