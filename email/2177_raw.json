If your tests fail then you can go\nthrough it and add logging and comment out the asserts so you can see\nwhat&#39;s going on.\n\nPass or fail.\n\nIf only all things in life were as simple.\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: Jason Rogers [mailto:jason.rogers@...]\n[...]\nAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nWhy do you care?  A test fails or it passes.  Period.\n\nIf you want more, JUnit is probably not the framework to use.  The\nframework\nis not meant to give warm fuzzy feelings (interpretation of green bar),\npains in the gut (interpretation of red bar), or minor headaches (amber\nbar?).  It is meant to tell you whether or not the code works the way\nyou\nthink it should.  It&#39;s a SIMPLE framework for developers and testers,\nnot a\nbogus-meet-all-levels-of-satisfaction-and-feel-goods reporting tool.\n\nSorry for the outburst of frustration.\n-Jason\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: dror2@...

It might still create a Throwable object\n(without throwing it), just to have  a stack-trace handy.\n[...]\n\n",
