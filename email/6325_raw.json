It started out something like \n(I forget the exact code so forgive psuedo-code comments):\n\npublic void testConnectionWithClearTextPassword() {\n   try {\n      // misc connection code here -\n      assertEquals(&quot;&quot;, ldapContext.getSomething());\n      // more code here\n      \n   }\n   catch (Exception e) {\n      log.error(&quot;Exception : &quot;, e);\n   }\n}\n\nOnce I saw what was happening, I discovered what exception was \nactually being thrown and turned it into something like:\n\npublic void testConnectionWithClearTextPassword() {\n   try {\n      // misc connection code here -\n      // more code here\n    \n      fail(&quot;Should have thrown an exception here&quot;);\n   }\n   catch (AuthenticationException ae) {\n      // Should come into here since clear text passwords are\n      //    not allowed.\n   }\n   catch (Exception e) {\n      log.error(&quot;Exception : &quot;, e);\n      fail(&quot;Should have thrown an AuthenticationException&quot;);\n   }\n}\n\nAnyway...I hope that demonstrates examples of both &#39;a sign of code \nthat we don&#39;t quite know what it does&#39; and why you&#39;d want to have a \ntry...catch block in a test.\n\n-Eric\n\n--- In junit@y..., &quot;Jason Rogers&quot; &lt;jacaetevha@f...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; If what you are hinting at here is -- Why write a dump to the \nconsole and\n&gt; not just fail() the test? -- the answer is, it&#39;s probably a sign of\n&gt; poorly written code, either in the test or in the tested class.  A \nstyle\n&gt; of catching exceptions like this generally tells me that someone \nrealizes\n&gt; an exceptional case can happen but hasn&#39;t figured out how to fix \nit...\n&gt; \n&gt; However, if what you are saying is -- Why have try{}catch{} at all \nin the\n&gt; tests? -- this is, of course, necessary for checked exceptions in \norder\n&gt; to compile.\n&gt; \n&gt; =jason\n&gt; \n&gt; On Fri, 29 Nov 2002 12:18:55 -0800 (PST), &quot;Peter Kleczka&quot;\n&gt; &lt;pkleczka@y...&gt; said:\n&gt; &gt; This message only has an HTML part -- this is a text generated\n&gt; &gt; representation\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;    Hello\n&gt; &gt;    I&#39;ve seen some testXXX() methods written with:\n&gt; &gt;    //////////////////////////////////////////////\n&gt; &gt;      try {\n&gt; &gt;             assertTrue( doSomething() );\n&gt; &gt;          }\n&gt; &gt;      catch(Exception e)\n&gt; &gt;          {\n&gt; &gt;             e.printStackTrace();\n&gt; &gt;          }\n&gt; &gt;    //////////////////////////////////////////////\n&gt; &gt;    I&#39;m wondering if this is really necessary.\n&gt; &gt;    As I understand it, if you&#39;re not explicitly\n&gt; &gt;    testing for a specific exception or lack of\n&gt; &gt;    a thrown exception, that you don&#39;t need the\n&gt; &gt;    try/catch.\n&gt; &gt;    Can you help me understand when/why you&#39;d\n&gt; &gt;    want to use try/catch in test methods?\n&gt; \n&gt; -- \n&gt;   Jason Rogers\n\n\n",
