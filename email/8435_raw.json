In these\ncases\n&gt; it seems counter productive to create unit tests for my own code when\nI have\n&gt; no idea whether my code will actually work when used with the 3rd\nparty API.\n&gt; I could end up wasting a lot time writing and testing code that is\ndesigned\n&gt; incorrectly.  In these cases, it seems more sensical to me to write\n&gt; integration tests which involve both my code and the 3rd party API. \nHow do\n&gt; people more familiar with unit testing handle such situations?\n\nThat&#39;s how I deal with it.\n\nFYI: The project I am currently working on has 70 or 80 &quot;integration&quot;\ntests that run with the other 2100+ programmer tests every time we check\nin code.  Every programmer runs the tests before they check in,\nreligiously.  We usually check-in at a minimum of three or four times\ndaily.  The programmer tests run in about 100 seconds, the integration\ntests run in about 225 seconds.  We are checking 3rd party code,\nservices, the server environment, etc. every time we check in.  It&#39;s\nheavenly!\n\n-- \nJason Rogers\n\n\n\n",
