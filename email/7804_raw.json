If you need some help\non learning EJBs and what to test the java.sun.=\r\ncom EJB tutorial is a good place to start.\nHere you will come up with some =\r\nideas on what to test.  EJBs are a quite extensive topic\ndepending on how y=\r\nou see it, try to focus on something first then expand your knowledge on\nth=\r\ne other subjects of EJBs, ie: start with Session EJBs and return a simple &quot;=\r\nHello world&quot;.\n\nAs part of the research project you may want to say that dif=\r\nferent tools are for different\nkinds of test for what I would also look and=\r\n briefly explain other tools like jmeter, junitperf,\nhttpunit, etc...\n\nGood=\r\n luck on your research project sounds like you will have some fun,\n\n--Rene =\r\nBaltazar Lopez\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: james_khu [mailto:james_k=\r\nhu@...]\nSent: Saturday, April 19, 2003 12:53 AM\nTo: junit@yahoogroups=\r\n.com\nSubject: [junit] JUnit and EJB! please help, a beginner\n\n\nHi \n\nI am a =\r\ngraduate student at a local university. I was just given a \nresearch projec=\r\nt on how to do both unit testing and load testing of \nEJB. They told me to =\r\nexplore the possibility of using JUnit to unit \ntest EJB.\n\nI must say that =\r\nI am still pretty new at this EJB, tomcat, and \nJUnit. my previous programm=\r\ning experience has been java IO,applet, \nswing, and some servlet.\n\nCan any =\r\nof you guys give a pointer on where is the best place to \nstart looking for=\r\n simple sample codes to run and play with ? I look \ninto jakarta.cactus web=\r\nsite, but they don;t offer step by step \ninstructions on how to begin testi=\r\nng ejb. I don&#39;t even know how to \npack EAR, WAR, or jar file. \n\nany help wo=\r\nuld be greatly appreciated\n\n\n\nTo unsubscribe from this group, send an email=\r\n to:\njunit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n \n\nYour use of Yahoo!
