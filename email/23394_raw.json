I will look into it. I like Bill&#39;s s=\r\nuggestion.\nSince this concept is becoming more popular imho it would be nic=\r\ne if it is supported by junit.\n\nLars\n\n--- In junit@yahoogroups.com, Bill Ve=\r\nnners &lt;bill@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi David,\n&gt; \n&gt; I usually see this concept calle=\r\nd &quot;pending&quot; in other test frameworks. It is\n&gt; a useful concept, especially =\r\nwhen testing in a BDD style. People like to\n&gt; sometimes &quot;flesh out their id=\r\neas&quot; by writing descriptive test names for\n&gt; which neither the test code no=\r\nr the code under test as yet exists. I do\n&gt; support pending tests in ScalaT=\r\nest, and when running through JUnit call them\n&gt; ignored tests. That&#39;s the c=\r\nlosest thing to pending already understood by\n&gt; tools that integrate with J=\r\nUnit. So if you add something called pending, you\n&gt; could still possibly re=\r\nport it as an ignored test. To see an example, look\n&gt; on line 80 of RunNoti=\r\nfierReporter:\n&gt; \n&gt; http://code.google.com/p/scalatest/source/browse/trunk/s=\r\nrc/main/scala/org/scalatest/junit/RunNotifierReporter.scala\n&gt; \n&gt; Basically =\r\nI do this:\n&gt; \n&gt; // Closest thing we can do with pending is report an ignore=\r\nd test\n&gt;       case TestPending(ordinal, suiteName, suiteClassName, testNam=\r\ne,\n&gt; formatter, payload, threadName, timeStamp) =3D&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; runNotifier.fireT=\r\nestIgnored(Description.createSuiteDescription(testDescriptionName(suiteName=\r\n,\n&gt; suiteClassName, testName)))\n&gt; \n&gt; So what you could do as a JUnit enhanc=\r\nement is for a pending test call\n&gt; fireTestIgnored with perhaps a subclass =\r\nof Description called\n&gt; PendingDescription. So existing tools would still u=\r\nnderstand it is a\n&gt; Description, but newer versions could detect it is a Pe=\r\nndingDescription and\n&gt; act accordingly. Or just add some state to Descripti=\r\non that old tools would\n&gt; ignore and new ones could use to differentiate pe=\r\nnding tests from ignored\n&gt; ones. Something like that would allow you to add=\r\n the new functionality in a\n&gt; backwards compatible way.\n&gt; \n&gt; In ScalaTest, =\r\nfor example, I could later change the code above so it sends\n&gt; such a Pendi=\r\nngDescription notification (though it would be a good long time\n&gt; before I =\r\ndid that because I wouldn&#39;t want to force people to upgrade their\n&gt; JUnit f=\r\nor a good while.)\n&gt; \n&gt; Bill\n&gt; \n&gt; On Sat, Apr 16, 2011 at 1:13 PM, David Saf=\r\nf &lt;david@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; My current feeling is that the best thi=\r\nng to do is to somehow allow\n&gt; &gt; custom categories of test results.
