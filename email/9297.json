Build your own mp3 headers to test with<br/>\n2) Write a set of tests for #2. Compare headers read in with those you<br/>\nbuild. It would be extra nice if you can reuse the headers you built for<br/>\n#1. <br/>\n3) Write a test for #3 that just takes a test file, and renames it and<br/>\nthen changes it back.<br/>\n4) Write a test for #4 that looks for files in a test directory. Add<br/>\nvariations for boundary conditions. <br/>\n5) Acceptance test: given a test directory full of files (of various<br/>\ninteresting variations), run the utility and validate that the files<br/>\nhave been renamed correctly<br/>\n<br/>\nNote 1: it is assumed that you will be including assertions in your<br/>\ntests above that validate that you are getting what you expect.<br/>\nNote 2: Your focus in tests #2, #3, and #4 is validating that you are<br/>\ncalling the library code correctly, rather than the testing the library<br/>\ncode itself.<br/>\nNote 3: It could be argued that for a small application like this you<br/>\ncould write test #5 first without all the other tests and if it works<br/>\nthen you are done. That runs counter to test-first and misses all the<br/>\ndesign and documentation benefits you get from that. Plus if it doesn&#39;t<br/>\nwork you&#39;ll wish you had tests #1-4 to help you isolate the problem.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----------------------------<br/>\nMike Silverstein<br/>\nSilverMark, Inc.<br/>\nThe Object Testing Company<br/>\nwww.javatesting.com<br/>\n**********************************<br/>\n* Makers of &quot;Test Mentor&quot;        *<br/>\n* and &quot;Enhanced JUnit&quot; Java      *<br/>\n* component testing tools        *<br/>\n**********************************<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Brian Forsythe [mailto:sycophant@...] <br/>\n&gt; Sent: Sunday, September 07, 2003 11:24 AM<br/>\n&gt; To: junit@yahoogroups.com; testdrivendevelopment@yahoogroups.com<br/>\n&gt; Subject: [junit] How (or whether) to test this<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m a relative neophyte to unit testing.  I don&#39;t have much <br/>\n&gt; trouble in writing tests for new code for existing apps, but <br/>\n&gt; can&#39;t seem to get my head around test-first from the ground <br/>\n&gt; up on a new app.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; As an example, I recently wrote a small utility that views <br/>\n&gt; the header info of an mp3, and renames the file from the <br/>\n&gt; information contained therein.  You pass it (on the command <br/>\n&gt; line) the name of a directory or file, and a &#39;template&#39; which <br/>\n&gt; includes the format of the name it should generate.  If a <br/>\n&gt; file is passed, it renames the file.  If a directory is <br/>\n&gt; passed, it recursively renames all files in the directory.  <br/>\n&gt; An example name template would be something like &quot;%b - %n&quot; <br/>\n&gt; for &quot;Artist - Track Title&quot;.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I actually got halfway finished with it, then deleted all of <br/>\n&gt; my code, since I hadn&#39;t done it test-first, but then couldn&#39;t <br/>\n&gt; think how to go about testing it.  I&#39;m using an external lib <br/>\n&gt; (jd3lib) for reading mp3 header info, and the standard <br/>\n&gt; java.io stuff for file manipulation. Every test I can think <br/>\n&gt; of would just test external code (reading mpeg header info, <br/>\n&gt; file renaming, etc), so I&#39;m somewhat at a loss.  Is there <br/>\n&gt; anyone out there who&#39;d like to get me started with a couple tests?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Thanx much,<br/>\n&gt; BRiaN<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>---<br/>\nOutgoing mail is certified Virus Free.<br/>\nChecked by AVG anti-virus system (http://www.grisoft.com).<br/>\nVersion: 6.0.510 / Virus Database: 307 - Release Date: 8/14/2003</div>",
