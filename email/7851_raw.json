See the JUnit FAQ for details on wha=\r\nt I mean by that. If B&#39;s method is trivial, then testing B only tests C and=\r\n nothing else, so I wouldn&#39;t bother writing the test. If B&#39;s method takes p=\r\narameters and passes them to C, then B&#39;s method still cannot break: only th=\r\ne methods that call B&#39;s method and C could break, so test those.\n\nI would u=\r\nse the same approach for the relationship between A and B.\n\nIf B&#39;s method i=\r\ns not trivial, then as soon as you feel the pain of duplicated tests mock t=\r\nhe behavior in C that B calls and use that mock behavior in the test. This =\r\nallows you to test B in isolation from any defects in C.\n\nI hope this helps=\r\n.\n\n&gt;So said Jonathan Oddy on 4/25/2003 --------------------\n&gt;I understand t=\r\nhat in general we want to write tests and test cases that are\n&gt;not dependen=\r\nt upon each other so that an earlier failing(?) test doesn&#39;t\n&gt;set\n&gt;state of=\r\n the underlying object(s) to prejudice later tests.  Okay fine, but\n&gt;I was =\r\nwondering how people solve/resolve the following type of dependency.\n&gt; \n&gt;\n&gt;=\r\nIf I have three classes A, B and C where A delegates some functionality to\n=\r\n&gt;B\n&gt;which delegates to C.  During my implementation and unit testing I writ=\r\ne\n&gt;tests for C then implement the desired functionality in C.  I then repea=\r\nt\n&gt;the process for B and A, okay fine.  But now I have an implied unit test=\r\n\n&gt;dependency don&#39;t I?  So when running my tests as a suite I really want my=\r\n\n&gt;test cases to run in the order C, B, A and never any other order because =\r\nif\n&gt;the defect is in C then I want to know about it from C and not from A o=\r\nr B.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;I am currently implementing a small library that does a lot of th=\r\nis style\n&gt;of\n&gt;delegation, and being reasonably new to JUnit I wondered how =\r\nother people\n&gt;work round this issue especially since those nice Eclipse peo=\r\nple provide a\n&gt;helpful &quot;run all tests in a package option&quot;.\n&gt;\n&gt;Thanks inadn=\r\navce\n&gt;\n&gt;Jonathan\n&gt;\n&gt;Yahoo!
