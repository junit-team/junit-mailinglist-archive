Rainsberger [mailto:jbr@...]\n&gt; &gt;...\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Isn&#39;t documentation the thing that should be used to tell the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; writer of code that calls yours what your code is supposed to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; do, or what the caller is supposed to do (or not do)?  (At\n&gt; &gt; &gt; least for code meant to be re-used, such as that implementing\n&gt; &gt; &gt; an API?)\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Yes, it is. Please explain to me why unit tests are not \n&gt; &gt; documentation. :)\n&gt; \n&gt; Because tests aren&#39;t specifications. \n&gt; \n&gt; (How can a test show that the caller is responsible for not \n&gt; passing in a null pointer?\n\nI do this by *not* testing that I can handle the null pointer. The absence of \na test indicates &quot;undefined behavior&quot; and you shouldn&#39;t rely on undefined \nbehavior. If the tests don&#39;t define behavior well enough to make the code \nusable, then likely important tests are missing.\n\n&lt;snip /&gt;\n&gt; (How can a test show that a caller is responsible for not\n&gt; depending on certain current behavior of an implementation\n&gt; that is not part of the interface contract?)\n\nSame answer. If you want to rely on my implementation details, you take a \nrisk. By not providing a test on that behavior, I implicitly state that that \nbehavior may change at any time.\n\n&gt; Because tests are code.  \n&gt; \n&gt; (They have syntactic clutter that is necessary for use as tests \n&gt; but which is just clutter relative to the information useful to a \n&gt; client programmer.)\n\nI&#39;m not sure I agree with this. If tests are my primary source of information \non a class&#39; behavior, then any syntactic clutter is either\n\n    * part of the language, or\n    * a sign of a poor test\n\nIn the first case, I&#39;m probably used to the syntactic clutter and can read it \nas easily as I read English or French. In the second case, the test needs \nimprovement, which will benefit everyone all round. That&#39;s why it&#39;s good to \nread your own tests from time to time.\n\n&gt; Because tests, being code, can&#39;t relate code to external concepts.  \n&gt; \n&gt; (A specification can say that a function f returns the mathematical\n&gt; sum of two given integers subject to the limitations of 32-bit\n&gt; signed binary arithmetic.  How can a test say something like that?)\n\nI would think that the name of the method says it, so the test doesn&#39;t need \nto. The test *can* say it, of course. If neither does, then there&#39;s trouble.\n\nTell me why three tests adding two signed integers together, at least one \nshowing overflow, wouldn&#39;t communicate the intent &#39;add&#39;? What if the tests \nwere named testAdd_WithZero, testAdd and testAdd_Overflow?\n\n&gt; Tests are great, but don&#39;t forget the documentation.\n&gt; \n&gt; It seems that some people who write tests waste one advantage of it:  \n&gt; \n&gt; I agree that testing, especially writing tests even before you \n&gt; implement, is good because it forces you to think about what your \n&gt; code is supposed to do and how it&#39;s supposed to be used.  \n&gt; \n&gt; Well, if you&#39;re already thinking about the contract, then that&#39;s a\n&gt; good time to document the contract.\n\nPlease explain why a list of well-named tests with clear implementations \ndoesn&#39;t provide ample description of the contract. Assume that the person \nwriting the tests is thorough and only leaves out tests when he decides that \nsomething is *not* part of the contract.\n\n&gt; Yes, I know this has to be modulated by what kind of code we&#39;re\n&gt; talking about (e.g., intra-program calls versus trans-API calls) \n&gt; and by how stable the interface contract is.  I just wouldn&#39;t\n&gt; want to have to read test cases instead of Javadoc to figure \n&gt; out how, say, Sun&#39;s Servlet API worked and was supposed to be \n&gt; used. \n\nOK, so now we see the point: you&#39;d rather read Javadoc than test cases to \nunderstand enough about something to be able to use it. I understand that \nwell-written, complete and thorough Javadoc is very useful and even better \nthan test cases written in code; however:\n\n    Most Javadoc is crap\n\nbecause:\n\n    I can deliver a working system without Javadoc;\n\nhowever:\n\n    My tests must run all the time, so my tests must be up to date.\n\nCode or comments -- which do you trust more, in general? I trust code, since \nworking code can&#39;t lie.\n\nI, for one, would be very interested to see Sun&#39;s servlet API described in a \ntest suite.\n\n--\nJ. B.
