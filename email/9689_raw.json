It&#39;s an automated test harness that you can use \nboth for evaluating XQuery engines (seeing which vendor is more spec \ncompliant) and for validating your own queries (making sure your \nqueries continue to work as you upgrade or change engines).  You can \nthink of it as JUnit for XQuery.\n\nBumbleBee -- named because it buzzes around FLWORs -- sports the \nfollowing features:\n\n* Includes over 70 automated tests representative of the W3C XQuery Use \nCases\n* Includes over 1000 automated tests representative of the NIST XQuery \nTest Suite\n* Includes adapters to 6 different free and commercial XQuery engines\n* Includes the runtime libraries for 3 free XQuery engines\n* Allows you to write and run your own custom XQuery tests\n* Tests are automated, self checking, and report an unambiguous pass or \nfail status\n* Tests can define multiple, possible expected results\n* Can run arbitrary suites of standard and/or custom tests\n* Can run tests against one or more XQuery engines\n* Generates a comprehensive report of passed and failed tests per \nXQuery engine being tested\n* Supports the addition of new XQuery engines through a pluggable \nadapter design\n* Allows disabling and enabling tests, globally or on a per-engine basis\n* Allows customization of whitespace comparison behavior\n* Supports negative testing, where the engine must report an error to \npass\n* Written in Java for maximum portability\n\nA free, no-login-required, fully-functioning 30-day evaluation copy of \nBumbleBee and the &quot;Getting Started With BumbleBee&quot; quick-start guide is \navailable at:\n\n      http://xquery.com/bumblebee\n\nLicensed copies of BumbleBee are available free of charge for \ndevelopers of open source XQuery implementations, and for qualified \nnon-profit and educational use.  Licenses of BumbleBee are available \nfor commercial use by contacting &quot;buzz&quot; at xquery.com with your usage \nrequirements.\n\nMike\n\n\n",
