This specific test case benefits from\nkeeping the test data in memory.\n\nAs for TDD, I&#39;ve found that it&#39;s tough to start with unit tests when all you\nhave is stories describing functionality. My first test is effectively a\nfunctional test to drive out an API. The unit tests are easier once I have\nsome method names.\n\nTerry Wilcox\nterry.wilcox@...\n\n&gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; From: Levi Cook [mailto:levicook@...]\n&gt; Sent: Monday, April 07, 2003 10:34 PM\n&gt; To: junit@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Subject: Re: [junit] expensive setup which is definitely only required\n&gt; on ce\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; I agree that mocks provide excellent utility in this scenario, but \n&gt; class files still need to be read from somewhere (usually disk) too.\n&gt; \n&gt; -- Levi\n&gt; \n&gt; PS&gt; Maybe its just the projects I&#39;m dealing w/, but I&#39;m finding that \n&gt; TDD is most effective (esp. the Design aspect) when my tests lean \n&gt; towards functional tests. A real challenge seems to be \n&gt; learning how and \n&gt; when to &quot;graduate&quot; functional tests into unit tests.
