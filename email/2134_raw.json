My reason seems to be different\nfrom any of the others I&#39;ve seen.\n\nI don&#39;t give a hoot about the total number of assertions for whatever\nmetrics purposes.  I do care about doing test-first coding appropriately. \n\nThat means: code some context, code an assert. \nMake sure the assert fails.  Fix the assert. \nAdd another assert to the same test method. \nRepeat until done with all things that assert against \nthe given context for the test method. \n\nMy problem is that my memory is poor, and I get \ndistracted.  I just coded an assert and compiled.  \nOr did I really compile?\nDrat, I forgot.  \nDid I just add a new assert to the body of tests or did I not? \n\nThe count of assertions would be something visual that would change so I\ncould get *feedback* and not have to trust myself.  It&#39;s part of the reason\nthere is a count of tests, anyway. \n \nWhat if instead of being a count, it was a simple visual symbol that showed,\nfor a given test class, that there is now a new assert that is being run for\nthe first time? \n(could be a royal pain to figure out... consider if asserts are changed \nor deleted) \n\nOr am I just slower than the majority of developers?\n\n",
