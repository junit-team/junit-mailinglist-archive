He \n&gt; writes that counting the branches is difficult if the message which \n&gt; is sent is polymorph. (Page 156)\n&gt; \n&gt; 2. I understand this to this point. But then he writes that the \n&gt; counting of branches is impossible if dynamic class loading is \n&gt; allowed. Why is it impossible then?\n\nBecause with dynamic class loading you can&#39;t tell what a message will do\n(you don&#39;t know the actual class of an object) until the object is\ninstantiated.\n\n\n&gt; Another thing I don&#39;t understand is the a solution to the problem \n&gt; with the Square class which extends the Rectangle class.\n&gt; \n&gt; The problem arises if a method &quot;stretchX(int factor)&quot; is added to \n&gt; the Rectangle class. Then you can override it in the Square class \n&gt; (so that Y is stretched too with the factor). But then a Square \n&gt; instance cannot be used everywhere where a Rectangle instance is can \n&gt; be used.\n&gt; \n&gt; He has three solution for this: reversing the extends relationship, \n&gt; extracting a common super class and introducing a value semantics \n&gt; (&quot;Wertesemantik&quot;).\n&gt; \n&gt; 3. How does a solution look like with value semantics? I&#39;m not sure \n&gt; if I translated the word correctly.\n\nI guess he thinks of immutable objects here - stretchX wouldn&#39;t change\nthe original square, but would return a newly created rectangle.\n\nRegards, Ilja\n\n\n",
