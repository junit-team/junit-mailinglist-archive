I&#39;ve bought a book <br/>\nfrom O&#39;Reilly, Java Extreme Programming Cookbook, that was very <br/>\nhelpful with JUnit but still doesn&#39;t cover it as deeply as I want...<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve subscribed the mailing list, but I haven&#39;t seen any link to <br/>\ndownload the PDF first chapter... will it be sent to me later?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\nLeonardo Barros<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Vincent Massol&quot; &lt;vmassol@p...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; Hi,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m happy to announce that my JUnit in Action book is now available<br/>\n&gt; through the Manning Early Access Programme (MEAP). This means that <br/>\nyou<br/>\n&gt; can subscribe to it and get the chapters in PDF format as they are<br/>\n&gt; published (first chapter is already published, 2 others will be<br/>\n&gt; published tomorrow and other chapters will be posted at a rate of 1 <br/>\nper<br/>\n&gt; week).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; More information about the book and MEAP is available at<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.manning.com/massol/\">http://www.manning.com/massol/</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Here&#39;s some information about the book (taken from the book&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; back-cover):<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Developers in the know are switching to a new testing strategy - <br/>\nunit<br/>\n&gt; testing - which interleaves coding and testing in an integrated way.<br/>\n&gt; This has proven to be a powerful combination that results in better<br/>\n&gt; designed software with fewer defects and faster delivery cycles. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; JUnit in Action shows you how to benefit from this strategy using <br/>\nthe<br/>\n&gt; popular open source testing framework, JUnit. It&#39;s a no fluff <br/>\ndiscussion<br/>\n&gt; of unit testing techniques and best practices. It gives examples of<br/>\n&gt; tough situations such as how to unit test EJBs, database <br/>\napplications,<br/>\n&gt; JSPs and Taglibs. It discusses unit testing of J2EE applications, <br/>\nand<br/>\n&gt; shows how to test in automated builds.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; What&#39;s Inside:<br/>\n&gt; - Unit testing best practices<br/>\n&gt; - Testing in isolation with mock objects <br/>\n&gt; - In-container testing with Cactus <br/>\n&gt; - Automated builds with Ant and Maven <br/>\n&gt; - Unit testing from within Eclipse <br/>\n&gt; - Test Driven Development principles <br/>\n&gt; - Unit testing <br/>\n&gt;   - Java apps <br/>\n&gt;   - Servlets <br/>\n&gt;   - JSP <br/>\n&gt;   - Taglibs <br/>\n&gt;   - Filters <br/>\n&gt;   - EJB <br/>\n&gt;   - DB apps<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Note that the book can also pre-ordered from Amazon<br/>\n&gt; (<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-\">http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-</a><br/>\n/1930110995/qid=1057695644<br/>\n&gt; /sr=8-1/ref=sr_8_1/104-1481474-9343103?v=glance&s=books&n=507846).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Feel free to ask any question.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Thanks<br/>\n&gt; -Vincent </span></blockquote></div>",
