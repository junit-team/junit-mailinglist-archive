Expectations are different.<br/>\n<br/>\nStill, I would think you could use a thin object to shield the actual <br/>\ncomponent from the environment. I work in an identical environment -- for a <br/>\nwhile, there, I thought you worked on my project. :) I have a &quot;shield&quot; that <br/>\nhandles all the nasty stuff about where to get configuration information and <br/>\nhow to translate my logging requests into logging requests for the framework <br/>\nand all that, and my actual component code can run outside the framework. <br/>\nDoing so makes it so much easier to write unit tests for the &quot;real code&quot; and <br/>\nI guess I have to live with how tough it is to test the component shield <br/>\nobject. Try as I might, they won&#39;t let me refactor the framework...<br/>\n<br/>\nSo you could build a bridge, if that helps you. It might be easy.<br/>\n<br/>\nJBR.<br/>\n----- Original message -----<br/>\nThe thing to reiterate is that we are testing Components that live in a<br/>\nspecific environment, and we must make sure they play nice in that <br/>\nenvironment.<br/>\n<br/>\n[...]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet your FREE download of MSN Explorer at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://explorer.msn.com/intl.asp\">http://explorer.msn.com/intl.asp</a></div>",
