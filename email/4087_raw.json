I have never seen that in JUnit.  Since JUnit doesn&#39;t count the # of assertions of a method, it has no possibility to know if 3, 1 or 0 assertions have been executed.  So JUnit cannot see the difference between:\n   public void testDummy() {}\nand\n   public void testDummy() { assertTrue(true); }\nin term of # of evaluated assertions.\n\nSo it&#39;s maybe a Cactus feature (I don&#39;t use Cactus).\n\n&gt; &gt;- find the testsuite that includes this class and remove the\n&gt; &gt;addTestSuite(myFaultyClass.class) call\n&gt; \n&gt; unfortunately, the suite() method just returns a new TestSuite(name.class);\n\nso define the TestSuite suite() method in the TestCase and only add the tests you want.\n\n&gt; &gt;Did I mentioned that it was ugly? :-)\n&gt; \n&gt; yes, it is ugly, but an interesting approach.\n\nI sincerely hope that _nobody_ will _ever_ consider this as something to implement!  Maybe some can argue that &quot;it&#39;s the smallest thing that can work&quot; but it cannot be viable in the long term and the sure path to speghetti code.  If you want to implement a soft-error mechanism, you need a ErrorHandler interface and/or better defined FailedAssertion (with the type of the failure) and maybe a huge refactoring.\n\n-Vladimir\n\n--\nVladimir Bossicard\nwww.bossicard.com\n\n",
