If one were to study their models, they essentially meter<br/>\nresources and charge for utilization. On the surface this sound really good.<br/>\nPay for what you use. But if you peel back the onion, you will find the<br/>\napproach flawed in many subtle ways.<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst, the economics of utilities favor cost recovery over value creation.<br/>\nWhen a utility incorporates a feature or a function, it seeks subsidy to<br/>\nguarantee its return on investment. A utility is a social construct that<br/>\nuses cross-subsidies to assure that everyone has access to the desire<br/>\nresource at &quot;equitable&quot; price.<br/>\n<br/>\nUtilities are successful in that they also guarantee standards (We all use<br/>\nthe same plugs but not XML schemas) and encourage interoperability (unlike<br/>\nMS). The problem is that the utility model totally ignores many of the<br/>\nhard-learned lessons from events that effected it such as deregulation.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe model fell apart when it was discovered that large corporate customers<br/>\nwere subsidizing consumers and vice versa. You will also notice in this<br/>\nmodel that companies such as Enron also lost the ability to track the real<br/>\ncosts of doing business.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe pricing model also falls apart in that many utilities still haven&#39;t<br/>\nfigured out how to charge for peak vs off-peak scenarios. Utilities in the<br/>\nvast majority of situations also are successful because they are monopolies.<br/>\nWhen one has a monolopy they tend to not value collaboration.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen looking back into the cost recovery model, one will also need to<br/>\nconsider that many large manufacturing companies are now moving their<br/>\nelectrical needs to their own forms of electrical generation as the &quot;cost<br/>\nrecovery&quot; model has made it more expensive for them to share than to do it<br/>\nthemselves.<br/>\n<br/>\nLikewise, utilities over time also have little incentive in a cost recovery<br/>\nmodel to perform continous improvements (key agile principle). If one were<br/>\nto examine telephone companies, you would think that services such as DSL<br/>\nwould be pervasive, but the financial model of utilities prevents many forms<br/>\nof progress.<br/>\n<br/>\nUtility computing is simply a financial model. Nothing more, nothing less<br/>\nand in this light should be discussed by the CFO if it has merit, not IT.<br/>\n<br/>\nCIOs have become savage in the pursuit of the answer that allows them to get<br/>\na handle on reducing the amount of failed infrastructure projects and<br/>\nuncontrolled spending on capacity but utility computing may not be the<br/>\nsilver bullet they seek.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you are interested in learning more about applying agile methods to<br/>\ninfrastructure, please visit<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/agileinfrastructure\">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/agileinfrastructure</a><br/>\n<br/>\nJames McGovern<br/>\nCo-author of best selling book: Java Web Services Architecture<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1558609008/\">http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1558609008/</a></div>",
