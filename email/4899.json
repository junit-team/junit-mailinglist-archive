Especially when the objects and interfaces <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; are in the midst of evolving.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; They can be made solid enough.  I myself also do iterative <br/>\n&gt; &gt; development.  I work toward the usage of the component <br/>\n&gt; before I focus <br/>\n&gt; &gt; on 100% functionality.<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; [...]<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; &gt; interface Store<br/>\n&gt; &gt; {<br/>\n&gt; &gt;     void store(String key, Object val);<br/>\n&gt; &gt;     Object retrieve(String key);<br/>\n&gt; &gt;     void remove(String key);<br/>\n&gt; &gt; }<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; That interface is enough to know how to use the object store.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; So what are your &quot;solid enough&quot; contracts? How do you find <br/>\n&gt; those contracts by looking at nothing but an interface definition?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I start there.  However, there are some questions that need to be<br/>\nanswered when looking at this specific interface.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat happens if I store an object with a key value that already<br/>\nexists?  Is there an exception to be thrown, or does it silently<br/>\noverwrite the value there.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe interface above suggests that the object is silently overwritten.<br/>\nI would likely change the contract of the interface to introduce the<br/>\nexception.  I would also add javadocs to describe that contract in plain<br/>\nenglish.<br/>\n<br/>\nNext question is does the retrieve() method remove the object from the<br/>\nstore?  The existense of the the remove() method suggests that they<br/>\nhappen<br/>\nseparately.  Therefore I add javadocs to clearly state that the<br/>\nretrieve()<br/>\nmethod does not remove the object from the store.<br/>\n<br/>\nLastly, we find that a useful method both for testing and dynamic key<br/>\nselection would suggest  that we need a new method to see if a key is<br/>\nalready used.  I would likely add that in.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou always have to have somewhere to start.  Usually when you design<br/>\nsuch a component, you already have a usecase in mind.  You test for that<br/>\nusecase, and make sure that the contracts of that usecase are clearly<br/>\nstated in the interface.</div>",
