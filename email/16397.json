I do have his book, but<br/>\nit&#39;s at work and I&#39;m at home right now.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, to a certain extent, JUnit doesn&#39;t actually care how the<br/>\nmethod that it calls does it&#39;s job. If you are testing<br/>\nLibrary.recursiveMethod() and it returns a result, then just test the<br/>\nresult. If there are some standard &quot;easy&quot; results then start by<br/>\ngetting those to work right.<br/>\n<br/>\nA more concrete example perhaps: Take the factorial calculation. The<br/>\ninput values of zero and one give known, defined, values. So when<br/>\nwriting a version of factorial, I&#39;d start with those and ensure that<br/>\nthey worked before progressing on to the calculated values.<br/>\n<br/>\nassertEquals(0, Factorial.calculate(0));<br/>\n<br/>\nand<br/>\n<br/>\nassertEquals(1, Factorial.calculate(1));<br/>\n<br/>\nThen, when those tests pass, move onto the input values that you know<br/>\nwill force recursive calculations.<br/>\n<br/>\nUsing JUnit isn&#39;t only about testing assertions, although that&#39;s<br/>\nwonderful enough, it&#39;s also about guiding you to think about testing<br/>\nyour code and making it provably correct before/during/after you write<br/>\nit.<br/>\n<br/>\nJUnit could care less about how you implement your method, but *you*<br/>\nneed to care plenty about whether it&#39;s testable.<br/>\n<br/>\nSimon<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nwww.simonpeter.org</div>",
