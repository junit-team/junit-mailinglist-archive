I solely refer to the writing of unit tests.<br/>\n&gt; Later saving of time (by better code) shouldn&#39;t be considered. So<br/>\n&gt; what&#39;s your experience? Can anybody do a statement about time<br/>\n&gt; consumption of writing unit tests?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It&#39;s easy to quantify:  How much time do you want to spend?<br/>\n<br/>\nI&quot;ve found that it&#39;s impossible to write unit tests for everything after the<br/>\nfact, without changing the existing code to make it testable.  Usually there<br/>\nis a module that is so tangled with dependencies that nothing can be tested<br/>\nin isolation (or a reasonable facisimile thereof).<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen you run into one of these tangles, you&#39;re faced with a few choices:<br/>\n<br/>\n1) Decouple the code to make it testable.<br/>\n2) Write some kind of integration / acceptance test that verifies the inputs<br/>\n/ outputs.  Abandon the unit tests for the dependencies.<br/>\n3) Ignore that section of the code entirely (This is too hard, and I have a<br/>\ndeadline to meet!)<br/>\n<br/>\nEvery time I run into this situation, I want to choose #1.  If the code I&#39;m<br/>\nworking on doesn&#39;t require me to change the internals, I might fall back to<br/>\n#2 in order to meet my deadline.  I used to fall back to #3 all too often.<br/>\nToday I believe that is unprofessional.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen you&#39;re estimating how much time you need to spend retrofitting unit<br/>\ntests, you have to decide which of those options you&#39;re comfortable with.<br/>\nRun some code metrics to determine how tangled the code base is.  Look at<br/>\nsome of the more important classes to determine how easy the code is to<br/>\nunderstand.  I&#39;d take those three elements, add in a dash of what experience<br/>\ntells me, and then provide a buffer based on the thoroughness of the final<br/>\nresult.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers!<br/>\nCarl<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://genomescampaigns.blogspot.com\">http://genomescampaigns.blogspot.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",
