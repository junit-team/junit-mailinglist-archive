I think it is a good practice to keep the tests as<br/>\n&gt; clients to the code. This implies that the tested &quot;units&quot; are public. However,<br/>\n&gt; it seems to be a good package design to have a small external interface,<br/>\n&gt; without revealing the internal activity. Testing the public interface, in this<br/>\n&gt; case, makes the units too coarse grained and it isn&#39;t satisfactory. Isn&#39;t that<br/>\n&gt; a good argument to keep the programmer tests in the same package structure as<br/>\n&gt; the code?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It is for this reason that many of us do keep the tests in the same<br/>\npackage as the code - but in a separate source tree. That way you get<br/>\nto have tests run against package interfaces, but can build the<br/>\nproduction source without them.</div>",
