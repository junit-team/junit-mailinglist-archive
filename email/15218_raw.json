Since JUnit 3 allows \n&gt; fully\n&gt; &gt; dynamic test tree generation, it can be undecidable in advance \n&gt; whether a\n&gt; &gt; given test case will even be included in the suite that is run, and \n&gt; more\n&gt; &gt; difficult than that to actually dynamically reconstruct the test case\n&gt; &gt; alone without running the rest of the suite.\n&gt;\n&gt;    That is true, but from other hand you don&#39;t really have to _run_\n&gt; tests to see that test cases will be included into suite. Note that I\n&gt; am not talking about completely random suites and in 99.9% suite()\n&gt; method will return the same set od test cases. So, IDE or other test\n&gt; runner could of kept these instances alive or even easier - recreate\n&gt; only this instance using number of the test in the suite as a key.\n\nI&#39;m not saying that it&#39;s impossible to make improvement, but that it&#39;s \nimpossible to handle every conceiveable situation, so we need a concrete \nexample of the situation we&#39;re trying to address.  See below.\n\n&gt; &gt; Eclipse will work correctly rerunning tests on suites made up of\n&gt; &gt; TestCases and TestSuites constructed in the usual way, such as\n&gt; &gt; suite.addTestCase(MyTest.class).  This seems to be a good way to cover\n&gt; &gt; 80% of what users want.  Is there another JUnit 3 pattern so prevalent\n&gt; &gt; that addressing it would up that coverage to 90%?\n&gt;\n&gt;    Heh. Most of the users don&#39;t even run tests from the IDE (those run\n&gt; on continuous integration server using Ant or Maven). That may quite\n&gt; change the estimate you gave before. \n\nThat feels irrelevant to me.  I&#39;m thinking about the integration between \nJUnit and the IDE (something I do a lot of these days).  People who use \nthese products integrated are the only ones I&#39;m hoping to please right \nnow.  Or did I misunderstand?\n\n&gt; In any case where did you get\n&gt; such numbers anyways? :-)\n\nSame place as your 99.9% above  :)  I was serious about my question, \nthough--if any of the users on this list are right now frustrated by a \ntest suite that they often use in Eclipse, and can&#39;t rerun individual \ntests in, that&#39;s a good starting point for a guess as to the next kind \nof test suites that Eclipse should handle.  Please log a bug in Eclipse, \nand CC the list (I&#39;m currently spending some time on Eclipse/JUnit patches).\n\n&gt; &gt; One cool thing about JUnit 4 is that while you should be able to do\n&gt; &gt; arbitrary test-creation cleverness using the @RunWith annotation, this\n&gt; &gt; is a static annotation that IDE&#39;s can easily check.  So version 17.1 of\n&gt; &gt; some IDE might be able to rerun tests run with TestClassRunner (JUnit 4\n&gt; &gt; default) and OldTestClassRunner (JUnit 3 default), and if it turns \n&gt; out a\n&gt; &gt; lot of people are using Parameterized, 17.2 could add support for that.\n&gt;\n&gt;    It seems violating the concept of annotations. You should not\n&gt; annotate the behaviour, but rather define enough metadata that can be\n&gt; used by the tool to decide how to behave. \n\nTricky, maybe, but violating is a strong word.  :)  Can you give an \nexample of how using annotations to identify the Runner that should be \nused by a particular class might be a problem?
