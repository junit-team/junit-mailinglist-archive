He took me to his  <br/>\nbasement and showed me a cute little DSP chip that he had programmed  <br/>\nin assembler to draw concentric circles on a TV screen.  The program  <br/>\nsimply manipulated a D/A converter to generate the video signal.  Cute.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen he said, &quot;Now, how would you do this using TDD?&quot;  He proceeded  <br/>\nto show me a java program, complete with tests, that simulated the  <br/>\ngeneration of the video signal, complete with the concentric  <br/>\ncircles.  The program he wrote was, in a way, a DSP simulator.  But  <br/>\nit was more than that.  In essence he created an array of objects  <br/>\nthat correlated roughly to DSP instructions.  Each of these objects  <br/>\nhad two derivatives.  One mimicked the behavior of the DSP  <br/>\ninstruction that it represented, and the other emitted corresponding  <br/>\nDSP assembly language to an output file.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe result was a very detailed DSP application, on a chip that did  <br/>\nnot support a high level language, written in Java using TDD.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhere there is a will, there is a way.<br/>\n<br/>\n----<br/>\nRobert C.
