I&#39;ve been assigned =\r\nto\na new project where I have a group of Junit test classes (around \n150). =\r\nMy aim is to setup a fully automated test environment \nstarting on the curr=\r\nent project status. I was thinking of using \nAnt as the the first step, and=\r\n then moving to some continuous\nintegration tool further down the line.\n\nI =\r\nsee two main outstanding problems:\n\n1) My test hierarchy is made up of a he=\r\nterogeneous set of classes,\nsome of which are purely stand-alone classes (i=\r\n.e. I have to \nmanually launch them), while some others are grouped into\nte=\r\nst suites. \n\n2) Test case complexity is very wide, ranging from very simple=\r\n \n(and fast) ones to more complicated ones than can take hours to\ncomplete.=\r\n\n\nSo I was wondering what is the best tradeoff between prioritizing\ntests a=\r\nt code level (i.e. with Test Suites) vs. at script level\n(i.e. by specifyin=\r\ng the desired order in an Ant batchtest task).\n\nAny help on this issue will=\r\n be greatly appreciated.\n\nBest regards\nEmmanuele Sordini\n\n\n",
