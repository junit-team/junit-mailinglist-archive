As long as your classpath includes both directories when you are testing all the necessary classes will be<br/>\nfound and everything should work fine.<br/>\n<br/>\n/src/java/com/nameless/foo.java<br/>\n/src/javatest/com/nameless/fooTest.java<br/>\n<br/>\n/classes/java/com/nameless/foo.class<br/>\n/classes/javatest/com/nameless/fooTest.class<br/>\n<br/>\nI seem to recall this being suggested somewhere in the JUnit documentation.<br/>\n<br/>\nI do this from within JBuilder with two projects working in parallel.  The application is configured as a library to the<br/>\ntesting project.  JBuilder seems to want to recompile the application classes into the testing class directory structure<br/>\nbut this causes no real problems.<br/>\n<br/>\nScott<br/>\n<br/>\nYongqing Ye wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; when i write test case for application, normally i group all the testcases<br/>\n&gt; in one package and application in another package. when i write test case<br/>\n&gt; for applicaiton method, i encounter one problem:<br/>\n&gt; some method is private, so testcase can not access it. i have to make the<br/>\n&gt; method public.<br/>\n&gt; in C++, we can use friend to solve this problem , but i can not do it in<br/>\n&gt; java.<br/>\n&gt; any solution? </span></blockquote></div>",
