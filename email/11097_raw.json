(How do I define a large project? If it goes wrong, then two VP&#39;s ge=\r\nt very upset and tens of thousands of customers are affected ... that&#39;s lar=\r\nge in my book.) We use JUnit for unit tests and to drive both functional an=\r\nd load tests (a little pragmatic automation in action! :-)\n\nHere are my tho=\r\nughts on the pros and cons of using unit tests:\n\ncons:\n\n1. You actually hav=\r\ne to write unit test code.\n2. You have to maintain unit test code.\n\npros:\n\n=\r\nToo many to list here. Just spend about two minutes googling or surfing jun=\r\nit.org and you&#39;ll get a bunch.\n\nI think that if I could say only one thing =\r\nabout unit testing that people would remember, it would be this: &quot;Unit test=\r\ning is the first toll booth on the road to software quality.&quot; (You may refe=\r\nr to this as Chappell&#39;s third law of Software Development). While I&#39;d be th=\r\ne first to say that there is more to software quality than unit testing, un=\r\nit testing is the gateway to software quality. If you don&#39;t unit test, then=\r\n it&#39;s either unlikely that you are doing the other requirements for softwar=\r\ne quality or you are trying to do them and they&#39;re failing because your bas=\r\nic building blocks (your testable units of software) are poorly written.\n\nI=\r\n could write more, but that was the main point I wanted to make that wasn&#39;t=\r\n already covered by the other excellent responses.\n\nSimon\n\n\n&gt;-----Original =\r\nMessage-----\n&gt;From: Kevin O&#39;Sullivan [mailto:kosullivan@...]\n&gt;Sen=\r\nt: Tuesday, June 01, 2004 3:43 AM\n&gt;To: junit@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;Subject: [jun=\r\nit] junit on large scale\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Hi - I&#39;m attempting to introduce junit testin=\r\ng techniques into \n&gt;where I work.\n&gt;So far I&#39;ve used it on a small scale, wr=\r\niting junit tests for \n&gt;enhancement\n&gt;changes to existing code.\n&gt;We have som=\r\ne large projects, along the lines of web booking engines for\n&gt;travel agents=\r\n, that already exist. One of the concerns that I (and\n&gt;developers) have is =\r\nthat we will end up with thousands of test \n&gt;cases, many\n&gt;of which will inv=\r\nolve using substantial amounts of MockObjects \n&gt;to set up\n&gt;test cases and t=\r\nhat all this will become too much of an \n&gt;overhead to manage &\n&gt;maintain. S=\r\npecifically,  that changing code in the future will involve\n&gt;analysis of no=\r\nt only the project code but also the junit test code - an\n&gt;overhead we don&#39;=\r\nt have today of course.\n&gt;\n&gt;Has anyone applied junit on a large scale such a=\r\ns this? I&#39;d \n&gt;love to hear\n&gt;comments about pros & cons and lessons learned =\r\netc.\n&gt;\n&gt;Rgds,\n&gt;Kevin.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;------------------------ Yahoo!
