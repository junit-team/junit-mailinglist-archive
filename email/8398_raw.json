Where it fails, is in that call to\nClass.forName(&quot;com.ibm.uvm.tools.DebugSupport&quot;);  \n\nLike I said, \nI created a very small program that only contains inVAJava() method \nand a main that calls it:\npublic static boolean inVAJava() {\ntry {\nClass.forName(&quot;com.ibm.uvm.tools.DebugSupport&quot;);\n}\ncatch (Exception e) {\nreturn false;\n}\nreturn true;\n}\n\nmain... {\nif (inVajava())\nSystem.out.println(&quot;true&quot;);\nelse\nSystem.out.println(&quot;false&quot;);\n}\n\nIt alsways returns false because of that call to a vative IBM java \nclass.\n\nThanks,\n\nLily.\n\n\n\n--- In junit@yahoogroups.com, Frank Burough &lt;fburough@e...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; As has already been suggested, don&#39;t export JUnit from VAJ, instead\n&gt; download a new JUnit release from http://www.junit.org and run \noutside\n&gt; VAJ to your heart&#39;s content. IBM has apparently &quot;enhanced&quot; the JUnit\n&gt; they ship with VAJ so that it runs well inside VAJ, but not so well\n&gt; outside. Most of us who use JUnit do not develop with VAJ.\n&gt; \n&gt; Hope this helps,\n&gt; \n&gt; Frank\n&gt; \n&gt; On Wed, 2003-06-18 at 17:52, ok_lilya wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Rainsberger,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I tried your suggestion but it still doesn&#39;t run. inVAJava() \nchecks \n&gt; &gt; for Class.forName(&quot;com.ibm.uvm.tools.DebugSupport&quot;);  and since \nthis \n&gt; &gt; class has to be linked with another ibm java class, it throws the \n&gt; &gt; same LinkageError: java.jang.UnsatistiedLinkError:no uvmtools in \n&gt; &gt; java.library.path\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; And therefore, inVAJava doesn&#39;t return true and JUnit stalls.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I created a very small program that only contains inVAJava() \nmethod \n&gt; &gt; and a main that calls it:\n&gt; &gt; public static boolean inVAJava() {\n&gt; &gt;  try {\n&gt; &gt;    Class.forName(&quot;com.ibm.uvm.tools.DebugSupport&quot;);\n&gt; &gt;  }\n&gt; &gt;  catch (Exception e) {\n&gt; &gt;    return false;\n&gt; &gt;  }\n&gt; &gt;   return true;\n&gt; &gt; }\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; main... {\n&gt; &gt;   if (inVajava())\n&gt; &gt;      System.out.println(&quot;true&quot;);\n&gt; &gt;   else\n&gt; &gt;      System.out.println(&quot;false&quot;);\n&gt; &gt; }\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Then I exported my program with package \ncom.ibm.uvm.tools.DebugSupport\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Seems that inVAJava() never returns true when run outside of VAJ. \nIt \n&gt; &gt; almost acts like a security feature - so that you can&#39;t run it \nouside \n&gt; &gt; of VAJ. JUnit uses that method, that means that it will never \nreturn \n&gt; &gt; true unless running in VAJ.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I&#39;ve been stuck on this problem way too long - There must be \nsomekind \n&gt; &gt; of solution to it! Unless JUnit is designed specifically to avoid \n&gt; &gt; being run outside of VAJ. I&#39;m on the verge of giving up.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; If you have any other solution in mind, I would really appreciate \nit.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Thanks so much.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Lily.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In junit@yahoogroups.com, &quot;J.

They should let the Model objects \ncontaining \n&gt; &gt; business\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;logic &quot;do with them what they may&quot;. There is a tendency in OOP \nto \n&gt; &gt; pretend\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;there is behavior where there is no behavior. I think that is \na \n&gt; &gt; mistake.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Some objects in the system are just bags of data. I think \npublic \n&gt; &gt; fields\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;should do nicely there. Ward Cunningham has been experimenting \nwith\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;ignoring the prevaling paranoia against public data. I haven&#39;t \n&gt; &gt; seen him\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;write anything on it yet, but it&#39;s good to test long-\n&gt; &gt; standing &quot;rules&quot;.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;I agree with that when it is applied to &quot;data structures,&quot; the \n&gt; &gt; naked\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;objects you refer to, but not behavioral objects.  I don&#39;t \nthink \n&gt; &gt; you\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;were applying it to the latter, I just wanted to be clear.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Exactly. I&#39;m with you. Sometimes, it&#39;s just a bag of data. Maps \n&gt; &gt; would do.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; One counterexample is an object with 20 fields. Perhaps 20 \nset \n&gt; &gt; methods\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;is clearer, at least in a language like Java with positional \n&gt; &gt; parameters.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;(In Smalltalk it&#39;s exactly the same, so it doesn&#39;t matter.) \nShould \n&gt; &gt; an\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;object have 20 fields? Perhaps not, but some do. It is not \nclear \n&gt; &gt; that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;breaking that 20-field objects into four 5-field objects is \nany \n&gt; &gt; better.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;A twist on that... If that object needs to have 20 fields \n(which I \n&gt; &gt; don&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;believe it does) you can group fields together into other \nobjects \n&gt; &gt; such\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;that this object is a wrapper on 5 others, each with 4 \nfields.  \n&gt; &gt; The data\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;is still in one place, but it&#39;s creation is much less \ncumbersome \n&gt; &gt; and you\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;can create it in a sane state.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I don&#39;t know that this is better: now I have to build five or \nsix \n&gt; &gt; objects, and not just one. I think the creation is *no less* \n&gt; &gt; cumbersome in this case. That has been my observation.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Take care.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; J.
