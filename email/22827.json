This morning suddenly when I run a<br/>\n&gt; test class with &quot;Run as JUnit Test&quot;, Eclipse reports &quot;No JUnit tests found&quot;.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I can still run individual test methods normally. The problem happens when<br/>\n&gt; I run the test class, and it happens with all test classes in the project,<br/>\n&gt; except one. When I run the entire test directory tree, JUnit executes one of<br/>\n&gt; the classes in the middle of the directory tree normally, then stops with no<br/>\n&gt; other messages. I can run that one test class normally. I can&#39;t find any<br/>\n&gt; difference between the one that runs and the dozens that don&#39;t. Other<br/>\n&gt; projects continue to run JUnit normally. Eclipse clean, refresh, and<br/>\n&gt; validate does not help. Closing and opening the project does not help.<br/>\n&gt; Deleting the project from disk and checking it out again from my Subversion<br/>\n&gt; repository does not help. When I drop back to a revision from a few days<br/>\n&gt; back, all works correctly. But I want to save and test my work since then.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; This sounds like Eclipse metadata got corrupted, and it sounds like the<br/>\n&gt; corrupted metadata gets saved to Subversion. I haven&#39;t been able to identify<br/>\n&gt; an event or a change in my project that led to this problem.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; What metadata might be involved? If I try deleting Eclipse metadata<br/>\n&gt; directories, what is safe to throw away?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thanks for any suggestions.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nMaybe she awoke to see the roommate&#39;s boyfriend swinging from the chandelier<br/>\nwearing a boar&#39;s head.<br/>\n<br/>\nSomething which you, I, and everyone else would call &quot;Tuesday&quot;, of course.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed] </span></blockquote></div>",
