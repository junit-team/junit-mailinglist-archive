So, separating test and design is all to the good. We have a well <br/>\nestablished design methodology, and (relatively good) tool support for <br/>\ndesign.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhere I see the biggest lack of support in testing tools is a formal, <br/>\nsemi-automated way to generate test stubs for requirements checking. I <br/>\nwould love to be able to extract from a structured requirements document <br/>\nand generate a slew of test stubs for those requirements. I just got bit <br/>\nin the butt today, by an untested class invariant: it was specified in <br/>\nthe design docs, but never implemented in the test code. (Bad Programmer <br/>\n- no biscuit!)  We&#39;ve been playing around with the notion of a tool to <br/>\nread the structured English requirements, and automatically extract the <br/>\ntest stubs, but haven&#39;t had the time to make any real progress.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI agree that there are at least two large stake-holders on the JUnit <br/>\ngroup, those who do test driven DESIGN, and those who do test driven <br/>\nDEVELOPMENT, and I think that both need to be supported.<br/>\n<br/>\nJim<br/>\nJ.

This seems to be a serious source of contention among<br/>\n&gt; programmers: we call it testing, but we mean design, and when we do<br/>\n&gt; design, testing is a secondary consideration, and yet testing is important.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Rather than repackaging TDD and calling it BDD, hoping that Sapir-Whorf<br/>\n&gt; will save us from our own sloppiness, maybe it&#39;s time for separate tools<br/>\n&gt; for design and testing. I have no idea how that would work, but perhaps<br/>\n&gt; it would help us all get along.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; So I&#39;d like a way to separate my design and testing activities when I do<br/>\n&gt; TDD. For example, when I test-drive behavior that doesn&#39;t yet exist, I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; almost always designing; but when I fill in the holes by adding a test<br/>\n&gt; for a case that should already pass, I&#39;m testing. Perhaps it would be<br/>\n&gt; better to separate those somehow.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Any ideas?<br/>\n&gt; -- <br/>\n&gt; J. B.
