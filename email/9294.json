    "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-124641517\">I&#39;m a relative neophyte to unit testing.  I don&#39;t have much trouble in<br/>\nwriting tests for new code for existing apps, but can&#39;t seem to get my<br/>\nhead around test-first from the ground up on a new app.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs an example, I recently wrote a small utility that views the header<br/>\ninfo of an mp3, and renames the file from the information contained<br/>\ntherein.  You pass it (on the command line) the name of a directory or<br/>\nfile, and a &#39;template&#39; which includes the format of the name it should<br/>\ngenerate.  If a file is passed, it renames the file.  If a directory is<br/>\npassed, it recursively renames all files in the directory.  An example<br/>\nname template would be something like &quot;%b - %n&quot; for &quot;Artist - Track<br/>\nTitle&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nI actually got halfway finished with it, then deleted all of my code,<br/>\nsince I hadn&#39;t done it test-first, but then couldn&#39;t think how to go<br/>\nabout testing it.  I&#39;m using an external lib (jd3lib) for reading mp3<br/>\nheader info, and the standard java.io stuff for file manipulation.<br/>\nEvery test I can think of would just test external code (reading mpeg<br/>\nheader info, file renaming, etc), so I&#39;m somewhat at a loss.  Is there<br/>\nanyone out there who&#39;d like to get me started with a couple tests?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanx much,<br/>\nBRiaN</div>",
