I ca=\r\nn write assertThat(someString, isMyMothersMaidenName()), for example, and i=\r\nt looks no different, stylistically, to assertThat(someString, containsStri=\r\nng(&quot;foo&quot;)).  The user can write one small component -- the new matcher -- a=\r\nnd seamlessly plug it into anything that accepts a matcher and get all the =\r\ntesting and diagnostic descriptions almost for free.\n\nDavid&#39;s suggestion is=\r\n convenient but cannot be extended. I can&#39;t write assertThat(someString).is=\r\nMyMothersMaidenName(), for example. I&#39;d like to see some middle-ground betw=\r\neen the two.  Maybe a factory function can use reflection to create a match=\r\ner that is then passed as a parameter to assertThat.  I think this is how t=\r\nhe logicalpractice-collections library works.\n\n--Nat\n\n\n",
