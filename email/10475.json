It seems some binary objects have been checked<br/>\nin as text -- so GIF&#39;s are damaged in the documentation, and the<br/>\npowerpoint tutorial is unreadable.  I&#39;m excited about using these<br/>\ntools for unit testing the gui elements of my project -- so I&#39;m<br/>\ninterested in the results of your own investigations.<br/>\n<br/>\n     Harold Shinsato<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a>, Timothy Wall &lt;twall@o...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; Do you want to functional/acceptance-test your application, test the <br/>\n&gt; GUI, or test your application through your GUI (if the latter, I doubt <br/>\n&gt; too many people will want to help you down that path)?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The toolkits you mentioned are all free, so why don&#39;t you invest a <br/>\n&gt; little time and determine which works best for you?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; On Feb 2, 2004, at 11:05 AM, Patricia Watt wrote:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Hi,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;ve been asked to find a capture/playback GUI testing tool to use <br/>\n&gt; &gt; initially on one of our products that is a stand-alone workbench type <br/>\n&gt; &gt; application that does a lot of database operations and has a<br/>\ncanvas to <br/>\n&gt; &gt; allow users to add and manipulate data.
