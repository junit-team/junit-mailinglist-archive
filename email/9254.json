It matters when one fails.<br/>\n<br/>\nLet&#39;s say that testB uses functions that are tested in testA.<br/>\n<br/>\nDuring development, I&#39;ll be coding testA first. When that<br/>\npasses, I&#39;ll move to testB.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut tests take time. And as the number of tests grows, it<br/>\ntakes longer and longer to get to the last test on the list.<br/>\nSo testing in reverse order speeds things up during development.<br/>\n(Or simply running the last test, rather than all of them.)<br/>\n<br/>\nBut when running the full suite of tests, it&#39;s helpful to<br/>\nrun them in the original order -- because sometimes a regression<br/>\ncauses a test to fail which was passing earlier, and it&#39;s<br/>\ngood to discover such violated assumptions.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo there&#39;s a tension between wanting to speed things up<br/>\nand wanting to verify that previously valid assumptions<br/>\nstill hold.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe only way I can see to satisfy both goals is to allow<br/>\ntests to run either from first to last, or from last to<br/>\nfirst.<br/>\n<br/>\nAny other ideas?</div>",
