That&#39;s the only thing that matters to<br/>\nme.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease bear in mind that I am programming alone, with test-first.  If I were<br/>\nshown value in distinguishing between both of them, then maybe I would switch. <br/>\nBut in the mean time, I will continue to treat everything as a failure.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks !<br/>\nFrancois Beausoleil<br/>\n<br/>\n --- pholser &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:pholser@...\">pholser@...</a>&gt; a écrit : &gt; &lt;jbr&gt;<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; One could argue that throwing the wrong exception type is a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; failure and not an error, but since it&#39;s impossible to distinguish<br/>\n&gt; &gt; between simply throwing the wrong exception type and something<br/>\n&gt; &gt; going horribly wrong, it is easiest to treat them both as errors.<br/>\n&gt; &lt;/jbr&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; i think it depends on the exception.  if a method has advertised<br/>\n&gt; an exception in its throws clause, a caller can anticipate that it<br/>\n&gt; could happen, catch it, and call the outcome a failure.  any other<br/>\n&gt; &quot;unanticipated&quot; exception would then be an error.  but in practice,<br/>\n&gt; it probably doesn&#39;t matter whether the throwing of the wrong<br/>\n&gt; &quot;advertised&quot; exception should signal failure or error.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; i was trying to use the exception example as a starting point for<br/>\n&gt; discussion about whether failure/error distinctions in junit are<br/>\n&gt; meaningful to anyone.  my experience has been that they are not--<br/>\n&gt; in either case, failure or error, you&#39;re led in the direction of a<br/>\n&gt; solution.  what do you all think?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; this, too, the failure/error distinction and whether it matters, may<br/>\n&gt; be a good FAQ item too?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; thanks in advance for the enlightenment.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; cheers,<br/>\n&gt; p<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\">junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
