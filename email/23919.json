This was part of the reason for that junit4 task I mentioned<br/>\n&gt; -- I needed a coordinated, full set of events from forked jvms (including<br/>\n&gt; sysouts, threading, etc.).

For example specs, <br/>\nScalaTest and Specsy (by me, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://specsy.org/)\">http://specsy.org/)</a> fall into these <br/>\ncategories. The causes of these issues are implicit assumptions in <br/>\nJUnit&#39;s Runner interface and overcoming them requires changing the API.<br/>\n<br/>\nOther goals relate to usability. For example I think that all current <br/>\nIDEs and build tools suffer from the issue that the following code in a <br/>\ntest won&#39;t print &quot;abc&quot;, but will more probably print &quot;acb&quot; or &quot;bac&quot;:<br/>\n<br/>\n   System.out.print(&quot;a&quot;);<br/>\n   System.err.print(&quot;b&quot;);<br/>\n   System.out.print(&quot;c&quot;);<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso it&#39;s not possible to run with one command all tests of a <br/>\nmulti-module Maven project in IDEA or Eclipse, when different modules <br/>\nhave conflicting classpaths (such as different versions of the same <br/>\nlibrary) or their tests require module-specific working directories <br/>\n(which IIRC is the default in Maven Surefire Plugin).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe rest of the goals relate to running tests faster: parallel <br/>\nexecution, test order priorization, class loader caching etc.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nEsko Luontola<br/>\nwww.orfjackal.net</div>",
