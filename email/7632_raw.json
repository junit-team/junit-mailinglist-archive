Here&#39;s a really short review:\n\n- the general idea is to generate JUnit tests from pre- and \npostconditions embedded into the code and written in JML\n- the user supply &quot;reasonable&quot; test inputs [...] by subclassing and \nredefining the setUp method of generated TestCase classes\n\nIn theory, this seems practical but I doubt that this will survive a \nreal world project.  Some reasons:\n\n- subclassing and redefining the setUp method means to each time create \na new TestCase subclass.  I can easily imagine loosing the overview\n\n- writing postconditions is not trivial and certainly harder than \nwriting standard tests.  Since TestCases are generated from these \npostconditions, I imagine that the normal process is\n     1) write postcondition with JML\n     2) generate tests\n     3) it fails.  But is the error in JML or in code?\n     4) check the generated tests, the JML pre/postconditions and the \ncode, goto 2)\n    I&#39;m not convinced that this is the fastest way to write tests\n\n- In their code, I see the famous:\n      catch (JMLAssertionException e) {\n         fail(e.getMessage());\n      }\n   which makes me wonder...  can they debug without any stack trace?\n\n- you have to learn another language JML and successfully writing tests \nimplies that you master JML.  How do you know that you master JML if you \ncan&#39;t test your JML code?\n\n- the example is _*trivial*_.  Testing is not an easy task (that&#39;s why \nyou have mock objects, db connections, etc...) so why are the example so \ntrivial?  At least I would like to see the testing of exceptions and \nstrings.\n\nI understand that this is a research paper and from what I&#39;ve read, the \nauthors have yet to test their method on a larger project.  I&#39;m not \nvery convinced by their method.  I&#39;m open but first would like to see \nsome real life examples.\n\n-Vladimir\n\nPS: JML is hosted on sourceforge (jmlspecs).\n\n-- \nVladimir R.
