Not a fan at all. I hate the idea of using method names in <br/>\nstrings. From the jMock web site (comparing jMock to EasyMock):<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;We have found that the use of strings in jMock is not a huge <br/>\ndisadvantage, especially if you use an IDE that can apply refactorings <br/>\nto names in string constants. Often when doing TDD, the method named in <br/>\nan expectation will not yet be defined in any interface, and so code <br/>\ncompletion cannot be used. We have found that the flexibility1 allowed <br/>\nby the jMock API is better at reducing the work of refactoring than the <br/>\nuse of direct method calls.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nBullshit. I don&#39;t want to create a corresponding constant for every <br/>\nmethod I mock. If I&#39;m doing TDD (I don&#39;t), even if I code to a method <br/>\nthat doesn&#39;t exist yet, my IDE can generate the target method for me <br/>\nbased on my call. That won&#39;t work with JMock.<br/>\n<br/>\nEasyMock code is more readable and the type checking and IDE support is <br/>\n*much* better. I can&#39;t imagine what &quot;flexibility&quot; could possibly justify <br/>\nthe tradeoffs.<br/>\n<br/>\nGenerics have changed the playing field. EasyMock&#39;s API has stood up <br/>\nwell while jMock&#39;s has not.<br/>\n----- CrazyBob -----<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst, I don&#39;t know why he&#39;s creating a constant for every method he <br/>\nmocks. If he lives in a world where all literals must be stored in a <br/>\nconstant, that&#39;s not jMock&#39;s fault. That&#39;s called &quot;tyranny&quot; and is bound <br/>\nto bad for a number of other reasons.<br/>\n<br/>\nStill, there&#39;s a flipside to the whole &quot;can&#39;t generate a method stub&quot; <br/>\nargument. With EasyMock, if I use a faked or mocked method that doesn&#39;t <br/>\nyet exist, my test can&#39;t even compile yet! When I practise TDD, I often <br/>\ndesign interfaces, and forcing me to generate a method stub for a method <br/>\nI might not even like yet is annoying. Keeping the methods as strings <br/>\nallows me to write the test, compile it, and even run it before I decide <br/>\nwhether the interface or method signature is good enough to start <br/>\nputting into stone.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for EasyMock being more readable, EasyMock 1.x certainly wasn&#39;t. It <br/>\nlooks like EasyMock 2.0 gives jMock a run for its money, at least in the <br/>\neasiest cases. The jury&#39;s out, since I haven&#39;t used it yet.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for generics, well... it&#39;s no secret that I dislike generics, so I&#39;ll <br/>\nlet that comment pass. It might be right, but I don&#39;t care. :)<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJ. B.
