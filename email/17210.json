If a method is private and sufficiently<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; important that you want to test it, perhaps the class in question needs<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; to be refactored in order to improve its testability.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; No, it doesn&#39;t. The method can either be reached through the public API<br/>\n&gt; (in which case test that) or it can be eliminated. There&#39;s no reason you<br/>\n&gt; have to invoke a method directly to test it.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>As usual, a better answer is somewhere in between.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you want to test a private method by invoking it directly, then it <br/>\n/might/ be a sign that that method belongs on someone&#39;s public <br/>\ninterface, such as a new class. If, after reflection, the method really <br/>\nshould remain private, then you should probably test it through the <br/>\navailable public method(s) that invoke it. If you have no remaining <br/>\nalternative, then consider using something like JUnitX.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs an example, if multiple public methods invoke the same private <br/>\nmethod, it&#39;s /possible/ that that private method would be better placed <br/>\non a new class&#39;s public interface. This, however, is just a guideline.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is instructive to take one section of your codebase and apply the <br/>\nrule &quot;All directly tested methods must be public&quot;. It will teach you <br/>\ninteresting things about object-oriented design, even if the result is <br/>\nnot necessarily the best (or even a good) design.<br/>\n<br/>\nI find when I&#39;m starting out that it&#39;s easier to follow simple rules, <br/>\nthen learn when to break those rules. For that reason, I applied the <br/>\n&quot;all directly tested methods must be public&quot; rule to a couple of <br/>\ncodebases and learned a lot. This helped me arrive at my current opinion <br/>\non the subject.<br/>\n<br/>\nI will emphasize, though, that one should remember what Elliotte has <br/>\nwritten above: /not all/ methods /must/ be tested by direct invocation.<br/>\n<br/>\nTake care.<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJ.
