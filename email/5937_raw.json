I&#39;m just asking :-)\n\n    \n    The answer is that we are following the model that many companies such as\n    Sun (NetBeans-&gt;Forte), Red Hat, Suse etc. (Linux-&gt;branded Linux), Rational\n    (Eclipse-&gt;XDE), IBM (Eclipse-&gt;WSAD) pioneered, where they build commercial\n    tools that add to open source tools.\n\nA little different though.  Sun owns NetBeans (another example is\nOpenOffice/StarOffice), IBM owns Eclipse.  I bought one copy of RedHat\n(5.2) but now that I have a high bandwith connection & CD burner I\ndownload the ISO images.  Rational is part of the Eclipse Consortium.   \n\n    Don&#39;t forget that many commercial IDE vendors reship JUnit in an effort to\n    add value to their own products.\n\nYes.  This, i think, would be a better comparison.\n\n    Likewise, there are people who earn their\n    living writing books and consulting around open source tools,\n\nLike my upcoming JUnit oriented book :-)\n\n    or use open\n    source tools in one way or another to promote their own ventures. For\n    example, &quot;The Coad Letter: Test-driven Development Edition, issue 102:\n    JUnit&quot; written by yourself asks that the reader &quot;consider Saorsa&#39;s intensive\n    5-day, Hands-on TDD course taught by Dave Astels.&quot; I assume you are not\n    giving this course away for free.\n\nYou assume correctly.  That&#39;s also a different situation, though.  But I\ndo see your point.  If I could afford to give the course for free, I\nwould, but I can&#39;t so I won&#39;t.\n\n    In the case of Enhanced JUnit, it is a little strange because we are\n    actually grafting some functionality that already exists in an enterprise\n    testing tool (Test Mentor) onto JUnit. There is actually more code (and\n    functionality) in the add-on than JUnit.\n\nThen it&#39;s more than an extension... more like the previous examples.. a\nproduct based on an opensource project.  Another example is ArgoUML &\nPosidon\n\n    \n    I hope this helps, Mike\n\nI doesn&#39;t hurt :-)\n\nDave\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nDave Astels\n  Coauthor of &quot;A Practical Guide to XP&quot; \n  Editor of the Test-Driven Development Edition of The Coad Letter\nCEO & Master Software Craftsman \n\nAn Agile Software Studio\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n",
