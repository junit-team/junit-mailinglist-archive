Each state transition is\ndone by send a message. =\r\nNow at each stage i have a set of testcases to\nrun. one example testcase co=\r\nuld be i send a join room message when i\nam not logged in, but befor i run =\r\nthis test case i need to be\nconnected to the server, which becomes a fixtur=\r\ne. So basicaly each\nstate i mentioned above becomes a fixture which display=\r\n a parent child\nrelationship, ie i cannot be logged in unless i am already =\r\nconnected.\nI need to be able to pass the socket connection across fixtures =\r\nand\nfrom the final fixture to the required testcase.\nThe approach i was goi=\r\nng with was to use JSystem for the fixture\nhierarchy implementation (which =\r\ni can really use here) and have a\nstatic helper to pass the connection arou=\r\nnd.\nAny thoughts or suggestions are welcome.\n\nAkhil Srinivasan\n\nOn 5/3/05, =\r\nArun J &lt;mail.jak@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;  Soln 1:Use Cactus which provides Serv=\r\nlet/JSP type test interface.

Based on the message returned my\n&gt;  &gt;  testcase will pass=\r\n or fail.\n&gt;  &gt;  Additionally I have to have multiple testcases that will se=\r\nnd messages\n&gt;  &gt;  using the same connection. Note that the server maintains=\r\n a session\n&gt;  &gt;  information on the client connection. \n&gt;  &gt;  How do i shar=\r\ne this session information(connection + related crap)\n&gt;  &gt;  across testcase=\r\ns, so that i can execute a sequence of testcases which\n&gt;  &gt;  will all use t=\r\nhe same connection. One mechanism i thought of was\n&gt;  &gt;  extending a testca=\r\nse that will contain the connection and use it as a\n&gt;  &gt;  fixture, all test=\r\ncases will call that as a fixture but how do i shared\n&gt;  &gt;  the connection =\r\nfrom the fixture to other testcases which them selves\n&gt;  &gt;  need to send me=\r\nssages?\n&gt;  &gt;  Thanks\n&gt;  &gt;  Akhil Srinivasan\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt;  ________________=\r\n________________\n&gt;  Yahoo!
