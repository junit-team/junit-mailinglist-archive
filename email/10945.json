I hope that readers do not interpret your <br/>\nremark to mean that separation is ineffective.<br/>\n<br/>\nI used not to know how to write object tests for dynamic web page <br/>\ntemplates, and after a few projects spent making those templates too <br/>\nsimple to break, I felt confident enough to try testing them. That&#39;s how <br/>\nit went for me: when I tried testing them, the cost of failure was low, <br/>\nbecause so much of the logic involved with the user interface was <br/>\nalready tested elsewhere. That gave me the confidence not to worry about <br/>\n  whether my UI testing was adequate--if it wasn&#39;t, then that wasn&#39;t the <br/>\nend of the world.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt turns out that writing object tests for web page templates isn&#39;t that <br/>\ndifficult. It turns out that writing object tests for Swing UIs isn&#39;t <br/>\nthat difficult, either (thanks to Dave Astels). That&#39;s not to say, <br/>\nthough, that the journey through &quot;I can&#39;t do it, so I&#39;ll make my UI too <br/>\nsimple to break&quot; wasn&#39;t well worth it.<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJ. B.
