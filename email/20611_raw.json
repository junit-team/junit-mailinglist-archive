For example, JUnit4Runner is an internal\nclass (I kno=\r\nw I should not depend on internal classes but it made the\nwork so easy).\n\nS=\r\no the Eclipse version, which ships with JUnit 4.3 could not depend on\nthe s=\r\name base class as the JUnit 4.4-based version, which ships with\nIntelliJ.\n\n=\r\nSo, really, the only limitation is my use of an internal class.\n\nAlso, I *t=\r\nhink* the version of the jar that ships with Eclipse is\nmissing the classes=\r\n in the internal package.\n\n--- In junit@yahoogroups.com, jayasinghe &lt;robin.=\r\ndesilva@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Hi!\n&gt; \n&gt; The sample looks straight-forward and q=\r\nuite promising.
