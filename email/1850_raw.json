However, to clarify...\n\nIf we go with one test method that method calls other private methods for\nthe asserts.  The only advantage I see to using two test methods is that at\nfirst glance it may be clearer what you are testing, but in my opinion, it\ndoesn&#39;t take too much more effort to look at two supporting methods.  One\ndisadvantage to this might be in metrics tools (like the one I posted in the\nfiles section) getting confused about what is tested and what is not (my\ntool doesn&#39;t get confused though :).  So, your call...\n\n-Jason\n\n    &gt; -----Original Message-----\n    &gt; From: Uwe Guenther [mailto:uwe@...]\n    &gt; Sent: Tuesday, July 10, 2001 4:50 PM\n    &gt; To: junit@yahoogroups.com\n    &gt; Subject: [junit] names for overloading methods\n    &gt; \n    &gt; \n    &gt; \n    &gt; Hello,\n    &gt; \n    &gt; is there a rule how I should choose the names for overloading\n    &gt; methods like these in my test class:\n    &gt; \n    &gt; protected byte[] engineDigest(){}\n    &gt; protected int engineDigest(byte[] buf, int offset, int len){}\n    &gt; \n    &gt; \n    &gt; 1. should  I use one test method like:\n    &gt;   \n    &gt; public void testEngineDigest(){}\n    &gt; \n    &gt; \n    &gt; \n    &gt; 2.
