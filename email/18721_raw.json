I feel obligated to \nthrow in a bunch of computer science buzzwords (greedy algorithms, \nNP-complete, etc.) This is, undoubtedly, a side effect of poor early \ntraining :)\n\n &gt;\n &gt; We can agree that no program can ever automatically assess the\n &gt; programmer&#39;s intent, but it is possible to enumerate efficiently all\n &gt; known (input, output) pairs for sufficiently simple methods, depending\n &gt; on the size of the domain and range of the method. The problem is that\n &gt; where I would really want automatic enumeration of all tests, it would\n &gt; either be impossible (consider the case of depending on an interface) \n &gt; or\n &gt; untimely (consider the case of billions of possible inputs).\n\nI&#39;m not sure I proposed exhaustive testing of every possible input \ncombination, all I wanted to do was let the characterization tests make \nsure the software was doing something correctly, and add a set of \nguidance tests to allow the test generator to also test that it is doing \nthe correct thing.  This may still be a large set, but it is the same \nproblem faced by humans who develop a test set: &quot;When do you have enough \ntests?&quot;  (Ooops, time for one more compsci buzzword: halting problem). \nSo, on the question of what is 100%, it depends on scope to a degree. \nWhen do you stop testing your code, and begin testing the compiler, the \nruntime machine, the library, etc.?\n\nPerhaps a more reasonable goal would be an automated test generator that \nwould produce a test set that met or exceeded the tests produced by a \nreasonably good human.  Essentially a &#39;best parctices&#39; goal.\n\nJim\n-- \nJames P. Gunderson, Ph.D.                Cognitive Systems Architect\njgunders@...
