While I was flipping through some pages in<br/>\nthe bookshop, I thought it was a great book.  So I bought it straightaway.<br/>\nHowever, I got very disappointed after I&#39;d got back home and took my time to<br/>\nwent through the details.<br/>\n<br/>\nTake ant for example, the presented material looks suspiciously like a cut<br/>\ndown version of those from ant docs.  I used it for a couple of times, but<br/>\nat the end I was so fed up and just used the ant docs directly.  Although<br/>\nthe docs have their fair share of inaccuracy, I&#39;ve been very happy with<br/>\nthem.<br/>\n<br/>\nPretty much the same verdict applies to other topics as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nSorry about the moaning, but I really don&#39;t like the book.  Anyway, thanks<br/>\nfor the offer, I&#39;ll consider it when I&#39;ve finished my current project.<br/>\n<br/>\nRegards,<br/>\nYiu Wing<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\">junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
