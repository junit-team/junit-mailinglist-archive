I&#39;ve got a number of <br/>\ndifferent objects where I have &quot;real&quot; implementation, and &quot;mock&quot; <br/>\nimplementation of an interface, to make unit testing easier.  At this <br/>\npoint, I&#39;d say that I have about 6-8 different interfaces that are <br/>\nimplemented as both real and mock.  So far, I&#39;ve dealt with this by <br/>\npassing the appropriate implementation around as argument, starting from <br/>\neach web request or Unit Test.  When the system &quot;running for real&quot;, <br/>\nthese objects could be singletons, or &quot;globals initialized at servlet <br/>\nstart time&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn addition, I&#39;ve got some information with is &quot;request specific&quot; (like <br/>\nWHO is doing something).  <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m getting tired of having to pass some objects through 6-8 methods, <br/>\nand it&#39;s making method signatures very ugly.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe question is, what do folks think about using ThreadLocal to create <br/>\n&quot;per request singleton-like&quot; objects.  By using a common base TestCase, <br/>\nI could set up the TLS easily enough without overburdening the unit <br/>\ntests, I think.<br/>\n<br/>\nDavid</div>",
