We (the Apache\nAvalon project) use Ant to do our builds and automated testing,\nhowever the behavior for test collection is different based\non wether a Test is a TestCase or a TestSuite.\n\nYour FAQ suggests that for one-time setup code you need to run\nit in a TestSuite.  The problem is this, we have an abstract\nTestCase that takes a configuration file and sets up a standard\nenvironment and several testcases written against it.  I want\nto make the environment to be built once for each TestCase.\nI can&#39;t simply change the class I extend to TestSuite because\nTestSuite does not inherit Assert.  Doing that requires modifying\na large number of tests that are already written.\n\nInstead, I had to do _alot_ of hackery to force my tests to be\nrun once and respect the run-once code.\n\nIn order to make my life easier, and other people&#39;s life easier\nyou should do one of two things:\n\n* allow TestSuite to inherit Assert, or\n* define a marker interface that runs a test AS IS (no automatic\n  dumping into a TestSuite).\n\nI guess another alternative is to change the behavior of TestSuite\nto invoke only one class per TestCase, and merely iterate over the\npublic &quot;test&quot; methods.  Currently, TestSuite instantiates a whole\nnew class for *each* method invokation.  This is IMO wasteful--and\nbreaks common understandings of how a class works.\n\n",
