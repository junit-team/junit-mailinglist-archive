The bad OO can come about because once you start using\ndependent tests, some people have a tendency to use &quot;global variables&quot;\nto pass intermediate results along the chain rather than provide good\nOO encapsulation. So caveat emptor ...\n\nTo quote from some more detail from Martin Fowler\n(http://www.martinfowler.com/bliki/JunitNewInstance.html):\n\n&quot;Isolation provides several advantages.\n\n   * Any combination of tests can be run in any order with the same results.\n   * You never have a situation where you&#39;re trying to figure out why one test\n     failed and the cause is due to the way another test is written.\n   * If one test fails, you don&#39;t have to worry about it leaving debris that\n     will cause other tests to fail. That helps prevent cascading errors that\n     hides the real bug.&quot;\n\nHave a look at that reference for an interesting discussion.\n\nPaul. \n\n&gt; I found this URL also useful.  I will update whether TestNG solves my problem\n&gt; \n&gt; http://beust.com/weblog/archives/000171.html\n&gt; \n&gt; Someone blogged saying this is not a good OO approach.  Not sure I\n&gt; understand what that means.  Simple equation: you have some CRUD\n&gt; operations and every other operations are dependent on these so all\n&gt; your other tests need to dependent the CRUD tests right.  Is this not\n&gt; pure OO?\n&gt; \n&gt; ~JAK\n&gt; \n&gt; On Thu, 31 Mar 2005 13:22:23 +1000, Paul King &lt;paulk@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; You might want to consider TestNG.

The only real extra we have is that some\n&gt;&gt; &gt;  of the database tests - I think only the BEB JE tests, but\n&gt;&gt; &gt;  maybe some of the RDB tests to - have a wrapper that ensures\n&gt;&gt; &gt;  that the databases are clean before testing. EG the JE tests\n&gt;&gt; &gt;  wipe all the JE log files out of the target directory before\n&gt;&gt; &gt;  running the tests.)\n&gt;&gt; &gt; \n\n\n",
