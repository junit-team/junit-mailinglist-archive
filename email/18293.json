The majority of the behaviour you are developing can be<br/>\nand should be ignorant of wheter it runs in an applicationserver or not. For<br/>\nsystem tests there is Cactus and MockEJB. I&#39;m not convinced that it is a<br/>\ngood idea to use those frameworks. I never felt had the need.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think in those cases deploy your application and run your tests as a<br/>\nclient. Perhaps using FIT or some other acceptance-testing framework. Those<br/>\ntests are typically run more seldomly than your unit-tests.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is just my opinion on a way forward. I&#39;m sure those who disagree will<br/>\nspeak up soon :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On 11/2/06, lenniedg2000 &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lenniedg@...\">lenniedg@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   Hi,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m using Eclipse 3.2, Orion application server, J2EE 5.0, Oracle<br/>\n&gt; database.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve written a jUnit test but it doesn&#39;t run since it doesn&#39;t run<br/>\n&gt; within the application server &quot;container&quot; and so can&#39;t find the<br/>\n&gt; database data-sources that I&#39;ve setup.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; How can I run jUnit unit tests inside an application server &quot;container&quot;?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Kind Regards,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Lennie De Villiers<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed] </span></blockquote></div>",
