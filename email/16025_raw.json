While jUnit is in Java, others work in other languages. You can find a list of some of those at:\nhttp://xprogramming.com/software.htm\n\nunder the Unit Testing heading. nUnit may be what you want.\n\nIt is my experience that the better you know the language you are working with, the easier these tools will be to use.\n\nGood luck,\nGeorge McKinney \n\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: nitin pallan &lt;focus_on_me21@...&gt;\nDate: Wednesday, February 8, 2006 3:54 am\nSubject: [junit] please do consider\n\n&gt; Hi i m nitin pallan. I m working as a software tester for the last \n&gt; 7 months. Now i am in a stage, that my organisation is asking me \n&gt; to study how to work with junit for a project. I dont know the \n&gt; exact process. I have gone thru some codings shown the helping web \n&gt; sites. U can u just help me out in knowing the entire process of \n&gt; how a Junit testing can be done. And on what all kind of languages \n&gt; it can be done. Also just tell me whether junit supports .net \n&gt; applications. If its not supporting can u help me in knowing the \n&gt; tools which does support .net applications.\n&gt;   \n&gt;  Hope that i get a positive feedback soon\n&gt;   \n&gt;  Thanking You\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;  NITIN EARNEST PALLAN\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;        \t\n&gt; ---------------------------------\n&gt; Relax.
