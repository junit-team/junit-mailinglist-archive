I&#39;m not\nlabeling this as impossible though I do think it=\r\n sounds impractical.\nWhen you write functional code it ought to be satisfyi=\r\nng some\npractical usage contract. If the contract does not exist then your\n=\r\nfunctional code becomes the definition of the contract. Putting a test\non p=\r\nre existing code becomes an excercise in putting a contract on a\ncontract. =\r\nIn short your implementation quickly and easily becomes more\nimportant than=\r\n the usage. (That&#39;s always been my experience and unless\nyou&#39;re extremely l=\r\nucky or extremely gifted I find it hard to see how\nyour results would diffe=\r\nr.) When the implementation becomes more\nimportant than the usage you compr=\r\nimise usability because it becomes\ndifficult to throw away functional code.=\r\n If you don&#39;t have a problem\nthrowing away code you&#39;ve just written for the=\r\n sake of a test (which\nwould likely indicate that the code you&#39;ve written n=\r\needs changing or\ndeleting) then I guess order isn&#39;t important. However it w=\r\nould seem\nimmediately obvious that writing that functional code first was a=\r\n\nwaste of time since it just gets deleted anyway making it more\npractical t=\r\no write the test first.\n\nOn the inverse, writing the test first would garua=\r\nntee a usable\ninterface where no time would be wasted on throw away code. W=\r\nhat I&#39;m\ntrying to say here is that the existance of a test is not nearly as=\r\n\nimportant as a good interface or an accurate definition of the usage\nof a =\r\npiece of code. The Test is the only place to define that and\nwithout that y=\r\nou will most likely have a bunch of tests that are\nbrittle and highly depen=\r\ndant on the internals of the functional code.\nThese types of test add no va=\r\nlue as they are difficult to maintain. If\nyou are lucky or knowledgeable en=\r\nough to write functional code without\na test then you are lucky or knowledg=\r\neable enough to go completely\nwithout the test. Writing the test would only=\r\n slow development under\nthese scenarios unless I&#39;m missing something obviou=\r\ns.\n\n\n\n\n",
