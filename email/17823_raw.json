B. Rainsberger wrote:\n\n&gt; Indeed. If I violate your precondition, then I am writing defective\n&gt; code. There are a few remedies:\n\nA nice list. However, I would claim only 1-3 are remedies. \nDocumentation, including tests as documentation, are not remedies. They \nare useful, certainly, but they should not be relied on. Much brutal \nexperience proves that:\n\nA. Programmers cannot be relied on to read documentation\nB. Programmers cannot be relied on to run tests\n\n&gt; 1. Be nice and tolerate my indiscretion, say by substituting sensible\n&gt; default values and continuing.\n &gt;\n&gt; 2. Telling me directly, &quot;You shouldn&#39;t do that,&quot; by throwing a specific\n&gt; exception that explains my mistake.\n&gt; \n&gt; 3. Telling me indirectly, by failing is some deterministic, by\n&gt; non-obvious way.\n&gt; \n&gt; 4. Providing me examples of how not to violate your precondition.\n&gt; \n&gt; 5. Documenting the precondition and warning me that violating it leads \n&gt; to &quot;undefined behavior&quot;.\n&gt; \n&gt; 6. Providing Contract Tests that I can inherit to help me know that my \n&gt; code won&#39;t violate your precondition.\n&gt; \n&gt; There are others, I&#39;m sure.\n&gt; \n&gt; It looks as though you reject #5 out of hand, and I agree, but all the \n&gt; others are viable choices. I would choose the one providing the best ROI \n&gt; for the situation. In a language that checks preconditions for me, I \n&gt; would get #2 for free. In Java, which doesn&#39;t, it depends on the cost of \n&gt; violating the precondition. If it&#39;s anything like persistent data \n&gt; corruption all the way up to loss of life, I would probably insist on \n&gt; #2. If it&#39;s nothing worse than having to retry one of a batch of \n&gt; transactions, I might go with #1. Still, I would probably insist on #4 \n&gt; and prefer #6.\n\n\n-- \n﻿Elliotte Rusty Harold  elharo@...\nJava I/O 2nd Edition Just Published!\nhttp://www.cafeaulait.org/books/javaio2/\nhttp://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0596527500/ref=nosim/cafeaulaitA/\n\n",
