Being very new to unit testing and TestDrivenDevelopment, Im\nhaving a conceptual problem (mental block) putting things together\n(and might get cleared up by my just writing this out, in which case\nyou won&#39;t be reading this ;-). Im hoping someone can hand hold me\nthrough my problem:\n\nThe business domain problem Im trying to solve is simple:\nIf &quot;Customer&quot;&#39;s last &quot;Order&quot; was greater than $100,\n    then record the fact that they are eligible to receive a gift\n    with their next order.\n\nSo I start out with a new class, say GiftManager and start out with 2\ntests:\n\n/* is a Customer eligible to get a Gift? */\npublic void testGiftEligibility() {\n    GiftManager GM = new GiftManager();\n    Customer customer = new Customer(&quot;joe@...&quot;);\n    assertTrue(GM.eligibleForGift(customer));\n}\n\n/* add Gift to customer */\npublic void testAddGift() {\n    GiftManager GM = new GiftManager();\n    Customer customer = new Customer(&quot;joe@...&quot;);\n    GM.addGift(customer);\n    assertTrue(customer.getGift());\n}\n\nSo for the first test to succeed we need a &quot;Customer&quot; joe@...\nand that customer needs to have associated with it &quot;Order&quot;s where the\nlast order was greater than $100. Now since you can&#39;t tie this test\nto an actual customer (the test would fail and pass over time\ndepending on customers last order), here is where you would use Mock\nobjects to create a fake customer with mock orders where last order is\ngreater than $100. All well and good.\n\nBut what do I do about test 2? Here is where my head is all muddled\nand I don&#39;t know what I want:\n\nSo Im coding this new requirement where I want to record if some\ncustomer has a gift associated with them or not.\nIm doing test first development, I&#39;ve coded the interface I want to\nuse in the test, and the whole point of testing this is to rest\nassured that I can &quot;addGift()&quot; to a customer correctly, in other words\nI want to rest assured that I&#39;ve __implemented__ &quot;addGift()&quot; correctly.\n\nI decide Im going to create a new table in the database something as\nsimple as customer_gift which has a customer_id and a gift_id\nand addGift( customer ) will create a Gift object and then create a\nrecord in this table with the respective customer_id and associated\ngift_id.\nSo addGift() will write to the database and\ncustomer.getGift() will be implemented to read the said data from the\ndatabase.\nSo what do I do here, create a fake Customer in the production db?\n(Ideally have a test db where this isn&#39;t a problem?) Maybe create a\nfake customer on test setup and then clean it out during teardown? If\nmy test breaks I may be littering fake data in the real db.\nWhats the strategy to use here?\nHelp!\n\n\nthanks,\nmbil\n\n\n\n",
