I think it is reasonable to\n&gt; &gt; say the test fails if its setup fails.\n&gt;\n&gt; No, it&#39;s not the tests that are failing, it&#39;s the setUp.\n\nI see setUp just as a programmatical way to remove duplication, not as a \nseparate entity.\n\n&gt; Imagine you have 100 tests and 1 set up.  The setUp fails, and now\n&gt; JUnit is telling you you have &quot;101 FAILURES&quot;...  Very helpful!  \n\n100 failures, and when I look at the stack trace it&#39;s immediately clear \nwhere the problem actually is.\n\n&gt; And QA  will freak out on you.  \n\nNo, they&#39;ll never see that -- I don&#39;t check in code with failing tests.\n(I also assume that QA isn&#39;t totally resistant to explanations.)\n\n&gt; Compare this to &quot;1 FAILURE, 100 SKIPS&quot;.\n&gt;\n&gt; Now, *that* is a much more acurate view of what really happened.\n\nAs I said, setUp and test method are one in my view of a test results.\nBut that may be due to I&#39;m used to JUnit&#39;s way of handling this.\nSo, assuming I don&#39;t check in code with non-green tests, why is it \nimportant to distinguish between skipped and failed tests?\nDoesn&#39;t a skip turn the bar red?\n\nRobert\n\n",
