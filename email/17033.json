I&#39;d be<br/>\n&gt;&gt; interested to hear a little more about your goals, to see if a different<br/>\n&gt;&gt; approach more along JUnit&#39;s grain might be what you need.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; For example, most of my test classes do not include @BeforeClass or<br/>\n&gt;&gt; @AfterClass, and many do not have @After.  You&#39;ll also have the issue<br/>\n&gt;&gt; that @BeforeClass and @AfterClass need to be on static methods which<br/>\n&gt;&gt; cannot be abstract.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; That said, depending on your goals, the following approach _might_ be<br/>\n&gt;&gt; useful:<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; public abstract class ApiTestBase<br/>\n&gt;&gt; {<br/>\n&gt;&gt;   @Before public void preTest() { doPreTest(); }<br/>\n&gt;&gt;   public abstract void doPreTest();<br/>\n&gt;&gt;   // etc<br/>\n&gt;&gt; }<br/>\n&gt;&gt;     <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; This approaches pretty much defeats the purpose of annotations, doesn&#39;t it?<br/>\n&gt;   <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It seems to me that the original poster&#39;s goal was to accomplish <br/>\nsomething that was beyond the purpose of annotations (a compile-time <br/>\ncheck that every test class has a @Before method).<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I&#39;ve had to do it many times, as have most TestNG users.<br/>\n&gt;   <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You&#39;ve had to do _this_ (a compile-time check that every test class has <br/>\na @Before method), or something else that also involves annotations and <br/>\ninheritance? If it&#39;s something else, then please post about that <br/>\nsomething else on a new thread, and let&#39;s talk about it. If it&#39;s this, <br/>\nthen please confirm, because that would be a new data point for me.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Inheritance of annotations is really handy (and pretty easy to implement), I<br/>\n&gt; would strongly suggest you to take a shot at it :-)<br/>\n&gt;   <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>JUnit already has some features that involve inheritance and <br/>\nannotations, but probably not every conceivable one. If there are <br/>\nspecific ones that are missing, let&#39;s talk about them!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nDavid Saff</div>",
