JUnit is great as a standalone, complete unit test framework.

Remember that the point of JUnit is not to\nfunctionally test the software. It is to unit test it. Try to break down\nyour code into small testable pieces. By testing each piece you will\nhave\ngreater control and more confidence that it will work once you put it\ntogether. It may not even be necessary to run the client and server at\nthe\nsame time if you take this approach; the test case could act as the\nserver\nfor testing the client and vice-versa. These are just a few thoughts --\nthe\ndetails of your particular program may prevent such an approach. But if\nyou\nare testing your code from the very beginning you shouldn&#39;t have too\nmuch\ntrouble doing it.\n\nChris\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: guillaume_berche [mailto:guillaume.berche@...]\nSent: Monday, January 21, 2002 8:49 AM\nTo: junit@yahoogroups.com\nSubject: [junit] Junit support for non-standard distributed applications\n\n\nHello,\n\nI&#39;m working on a Java layer implementing various communication \ninfrastructrure betwen processes based on raw TCP and UDP. I would \nlike to test it using Junit. However, this requires me to write a \ntest case which is distributed among many processes which act as \nclient/servers.\n\nI&#39;ve looked into jakarta&#39;s cactus, and Junit EE but I understand they \nwould support only distributed applications based on standard \ncommunication protocols (namely HTTP and an EJB contained)\n\nIs there an extension to Junit that would support testing of non-\nstandard distributed applications?\n\nI&#39;ve started designing an RMI-based version of the junit interfaces \nwhere a testcase could spawn one or more &quot;distributed test cases&quot; \nrunning on remote hosts and that would report their status through \nthe originating test&#39;s TestListener. I&#39;m basically remotizing the \njunit interfaces.\n\nI wonder if such extension would already exist and if I could reuse \nit rather than redoing this from scratch. \n\nThanks for your help,\n\nGuillaume.\n\n\n\nTo unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\njunit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n \n\nYour use of Yahoo!
