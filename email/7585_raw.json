B. Rainsberge=\r\nr wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;Can you explain why is 1. better?\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; 1. The data is i=\r\nn the test where I can see it, rather than in a file.\n&gt;\n&gt;I&#39;m not mad about =\r\nkeeping test files in java code, at least not more \n&gt;than one or two of the=\r\nm:\n&gt;\n&gt;   * alt/ctrl-tab means you can see the file if you want to\n\nAfter yo=\r\nu load it into a text editor, after you find it on the file system.\n\n&gt;   * =\r\nchanging the file in java code means recompiling\n\nTrue enough.\n\n&gt;   * java =\r\ndoesn&#39;t suport multiline strings\n\nThat *is* an annoyance, to be sure.\n\n&gt;   =\r\n* What if you have say, 30 files?\n\nI would be surprised to have 30 useful, =\r\ndifferent programmer-level test cases. If the object is that complex, then =\r\nmaybe it&#39;s really more than one object. I&#39;d need a concrete example to be s=\r\nure.\n\nI always assume we&#39;re talking Programmer Tests here, and in that case=\r\n, the files would rarely need to be that long or that complex.\n\n&gt;&gt; 2. Using=\r\n data in a file means worrying about where the files are on the\n&gt;file syste=\r\nm when executing the tests.\n&gt;\n&gt;Use a relative offset from your project.home=\r\n\n\n&quot;project.home&quot;? You&#39;re assuming Ant, I guess. Ant is widely-accepted, but=\r\n not universal... yet.\n\n&gt;&gt; 3. What if I need to execute the tests on a file=\r\n system that doesn&#39;t\n&gt;understand &quot;g:/myCsvFiles&quot;? (Yes, there are solutions=\r\n, but none as easy as\n&gt;not having to worry about it.)\n&gt;\n&gt;What if I need to =\r\ncompile the java on a file system that doesn&#39;t \n&gt;understand &quot;g:/myCsvFiles&quot;=\r\n?\n\nI don&#39;t understand your implied point here.\n\n&gt;&gt; 4. Tests that require th=\r\ne file system are slower.\n&gt;\n&gt;Not much. And not at all if you&#39;re testing thr=\r\nough changing/adding \n&gt;files and not by changing the code.\n\nI agree &quot;not mu=\r\nch&quot;, except when there are 1000 tests.\n\nI don&#39;t understand the logic of the=\r\n second sentence.\n\n&gt;&gt; 5. Cleaning up the file system is asynchronous (from =\r\nwhat I can tell)\n&gt;and unreliable to do in tests that execute at a rate of d=\r\nozens per second.\n&gt;\n&gt;If you have to clean up the file system, clean up at t=\r\nhe end the \n&gt;run; use Ant to rmdir.\n\nWhen was the last time you tried this?=\r\n When I did, tearDown() finished before the files were removed, then the ne=\r\nxt test&#39;s setUp() complained that files already existed. That&#39;s why I don&#39;t=\r\n like to do it. If the Java File calls were synchronized with the underlyin=\r\ng file system, then this wouldn&#39;t be a problem.\n\n&gt;&gt; Processing the data is =\r\nseparate from reading/writing the data. This\n&gt;implies two separate classes.=\r\n\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; csvDataProcessor.findDuplicates(new CsvFileReader(fileName));\n&gt;&gt; ..=\r\n.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; This is exactly how XSL transformers work: transforming XML and\n&gt;r=\r\neading/writing XML are separate concerns.\n&gt;\n&gt;+1\n\nI assume you mean that I s=\r\ncored a point here. :)\n\nTake care.\n\n\nJ.
