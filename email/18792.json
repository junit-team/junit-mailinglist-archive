It took me a couple semesters after<br/>\nthat, but I finally realized that CS 1 is actually *easier* with JUnit.<br/>\n   I started using it in the CS 1 labs and projects, and students seemed<br/>\nto respond well.  They actually responded much better to JUnit tests<br/>\nthan to command-line drivers.  CL drivers never work the way students<br/>\nwould like, mostly because parsing is so tricky.<br/>\n<br/>\nA colleague started using unit tests in CS 2 as well.  Unfortunately, CS<br/>\n2 for us is in C++, and my colleague was more happy with the standard<br/>\nC++ &quot;assert&quot; than any C++ unit-testing library.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn either case, I have to stress that we teach *unit testing* in CS 1<br/>\nand CS 2.  There is no way these students would be able to handle<br/>\nrefactoring.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m currently on sabbatical, and my project is to work on teaching<br/>\nmaterials (lab manual and maybe even a textbook) for a Programming<br/>\nLanguages course (taken 2nd semester, sophomore year).  My approach to<br/>\nthis course is for students to build interpreters using incremental<br/>\ndevelopment and *true* TDD.  What&#39;s really cool about this is that most<br/>\n(if not all) refactorings are just transformations based on PL theory,<br/>\nso I can justify it on PL grounds, not just good-practice grounds.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe problem now is a missing step in Joe&#39;s &quot;algorithm&quot;.  I&#39;d add a step:<br/>\n<br/>\n  3.5.  If enough teach it, teaching materials get produced.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile this step is implicit in steps 4 and 5, I think *right now* it&#39;s<br/>\nthe sticking point in the process, and so I&#39;m going to make the step<br/>\nexplicit.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo my knowledge, no Java or C++ introductory textbooks describe or use<br/>\nJUnit.  There are some excellent books on JUnit and TDD, but they&#39;re<br/>\nwritten for reasonably experienced programmers.  We need materials for<br/>\nthe beginning programmer.  My CS 1 lab manual (which uses JUnit<br/>\neverywhere, all the time) is currently just for private use; I am<br/>\nplanning to get it published somehow, somewhere.  I hope to do the same<br/>\nto my PL materials.<br/>\n<br/>\njdf<br/>\n<br/>\n- --<br/>\n* Jeremy D.
