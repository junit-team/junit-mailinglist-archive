I&#39;ve \n&gt; looked at JUnitPerf and I don&#39;t think it has the functionality I need.  I&#39;d like \n&gt; to record the time taken to execute individual junit tests.  The idea is that it \n&gt; should then be possible identify when code changes occurred that caused a \n&gt; significant drop in performance.\n&gt; \n&gt; thanks\n&gt; Nathan\n\nYou could probably do this if you wrote a custom TestRunner.\n\nIf you know Aspect-Oriented Programming, this also seems like a good use for it. \n  It would be fairly simple to write an aspect which reported elapsed execution \ntime on a per-test-method level.  You could write the data on all tests for each \nrun to a CSV file, for example.  Then you could use a spreadsheet or other tool \nto perform trend analysis on the collected data over time.\n\n\n\n",
