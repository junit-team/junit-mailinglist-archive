Both\n&gt; result1 and result2 might be identical in value some\n&gt; of the time, for a many to one function. Using Junit,\n&gt; how can one know that both paths have been exercised\n&gt; or tested? \n\nJUnit (AFAIK) does not report code coverage, if that&#39;s what you&#39;re asking.\nIt won&#39;t tell you what lines were not executed after a test suite run is\ndone. Code coverage tools can help show you areas missed by testing, but\nthey aren&#39;t perfect. I&#39;m not Java experienced enough to know what Java\ncoverage tools are out there.\n\nChris\n\n",
