After thinking <br/>\nabout this now I would have to agree with the reasons people are putting <br/>\nforward about private methods. I can now start seeing some improvements that <br/>\ncan be made in my design :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nSo thanks to all that have contributed in this discussion and helped me open <br/>\nmy eyes that little bit more - which are not usually very wide open in <br/>\nmornings!.<br/>\n<br/>\nA+ David<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On 30/08/05, Michael Feathers &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mfeathers@...\">mfeathers@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;  David wrote:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Hi,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I don&#39;t agree with this. Imagine that you have class with one point of <br/>\n&gt; &gt; entry<br/>\n&gt; &gt; for the client i.e. one public method. You can&#39;t change the access <br/>\n&gt; &gt; modifier<br/>\n&gt; &gt; of your method just to test it. Wrapping your private method in a public<br/>\n&gt; &gt; method is just the same as changing the access modifier. It is will<br/>\n&gt; &gt; documented and it works to use java reflection.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; The developers in the project I am currently working changed their <br/>\n&gt; &gt; private<br/>\n&gt; &gt; methods to public just to UNIT test their code. It is currently very<br/>\n&gt; &gt; important to test the private methods as it accounts for over 60% of the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; functionality and logic. I have found that enables me to test bottom <br/>\n&gt; &gt; up and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I have more confidence when coding and when I need to refactor.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I have posted the SecureClassAccess.java in the &quot;files&quot; section of <br/>\n&gt; &gt; group for<br/>\n&gt; &gt; anyone that does want to us it to test their private methods.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The issue is that when it is hard to test something without tricks (like <br/>\n&gt; reflective access) it usually means that there is a design with better <br/>\n&gt; cohesion out there to discover. I&#39;d say that if 60% of your logic is in <br/>\n&gt; private methods, then chances are very high that this is true for that <br/>\n&gt; code.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Michael Feathers<br/>\n&gt; www.objectmentor.com &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.objectmentor.com\">http://www.objectmentor.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;  ------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; YAHOO!
