Agitator can help identify technical loss: boundary\n&gt; cases that might be of interest to the programmer and might represent\n&gt; technical holes other modules can exploit to hurt the system. This is\n&gt; how I imagine using Agitator in my practice.\n&gt;\n&gt; How does that sound?\n\nI think that&#39;s headed the right direction but I wouldn&#39;t want to give\nundue credit to the tool here: the Agitator might point out that a\ncertain exception will happen but it can&#39;t make the judgement about if\nthat is expected or if there is potential technical loss.\nFundamentally it is the developer who is in control and who needs to\nsupply that judgement; Agitator&#39;s role is to submit that behavior to\nthe developer for judgement.\n\nJtf\n\n-- \n\nhttp://www.developertesting.com/\n\n",
