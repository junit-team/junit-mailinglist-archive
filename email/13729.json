No matter how good Erich and Kent may be, I <br/>\ndon&#39;t think they can think of everything (thus a version 3.8.1 instead <br/>\nof the it-is-perfect-and-nothing-else-needs-to-be-added-1.0 version). ;)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; To call a method which does nothing, makes no sense in<br/>\n&gt; my eyes. It silences Checkstyle, but is nonsense<br/>\n&gt; nevertheless. Of course methods like pass() or<br/>\n&gt; assertTrue(true) are a kind of documentation. But this<br/>\n&gt; is also a kind of documentation, and can be used<br/>\n&gt; everywhere, not just for a test:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This may be opening a can of worms, nevertheless... No-op methods are <br/>\nnot always unneccessary.  Consider the case of a TemplateMethod where an <br/>\nimplementor of the template steps may not need to do anything at a <br/>\nparticular point.  I might be able to think of other cases where I have <br/>\nintentionally called no-op methods, but they aren&#39;t popping to mind just <br/>\nnow.<br/>\n<br/>\nBesides that, a method like pass() IS intention-revealing.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJason Rogers<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I,<br/>\nbut Christ liveth in me: and the life which I now live in <br/>\nthe flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved <br/>\nme, and gave himself for me.&quot;<br/>\n    Galatians 2:20</div>",
