It was difficult to explain and it made writing test<br/>\nrunners more difficult. One particularly vexing problem was re-running<br/>\nsingle tests while making sure all the TestDecorators and TestSuite<br/>\nsubclasses higher in the test tree were run correctly. Instead, the JUnit 4<br/>\nrunner takes a flat array of test classes. This is easier to explain and<br/>\neasier to implement correctly.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow we are encountering just how heavily used TestDecorator and TestSuite<br/>\nsubclassing are used in JUnit extensions. Our challenge is to provide<br/>\nequivalently powerful extension mechanisms while retaining the simplicity of<br/>\nthe new approach. One such is the @BeforeClass/@AfterClass annotations. If<br/>\nwe can&#39;t provide enough extensibility with two-level suite specifications,<br/>\nwe will go back to recursive test suites. In the meantime, our new runner<br/>\nshould run pre-JUnit 4-style tests correctly.<br/>\n<br/>\nSincerely yours,<br/>\n<br/>\nKent Beck<br/>\nThree Rivers Institute<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a>] On <br/>\n&gt; Behalf Of Chris Dollin<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Tuesday, June 21, 2005 2:38 AM<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: [junit] JUnit 4<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; On Tuesday 21 June 2005 10:16, Kent Beck wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Jason,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I see what you mean.
