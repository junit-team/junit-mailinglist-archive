My tests are failures<br/>\n&gt; , the configuration is.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I have always found the difference between ERROR and<br/>\n&gt; FAILURE confusing and I bet that except for JUnit experts<br/>\n&gt; such as yourself, nobody can really explain it.  <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>From the JUnit cookbook:<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;In the case of an unsuccessful test JUnit reports the<br/>\nfailed tests in a list at the bottom. JUnit distinguishes<br/>\nbetween failures and errors. A failure is anticipated and<br/>\nchecked for with assertions. Errors are unanticipated<br/>\nproblems like an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException. The<br/>\nfollowing figure shows an example of a failed test.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nIt doesn&#39;t get much clear than that... now, I know that<br/>\npeople will rather post questions to a mailing list than<br/>\nread the doco, but at least it is in there.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Assuming that it&#39;s important to know whether a test failed<br/>\n&gt; because of an assert of an unexpected exception (a dubious<br/>\n&gt; proposition in the first place since when a test fails,<br/>\n&gt; you are going to check out the stack trace anyway and find<br/>\n&gt; out exactly where it failed), it would certainly have been<br/>\n&gt; better to name them differently.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>The point of the difference, Cedric, is that when you come<br/>\nin and find that 101 tests didn&#39;t pass, you should start<br/>\nwith the failing tests before going on to the error tests.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe same goes if you come in and find that 101 tests didn&#39;t<br/>\npass because 100 were skipped - you&#39;d presumably start with<br/>\nthe failing one first. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, these are habits to develop, but they aren&#39;t hard<br/>\nhabits to develop.<br/>\n<br/>\nRobert.</div>",
