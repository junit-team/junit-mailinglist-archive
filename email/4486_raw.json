If I run\na test in the emulator (type 1 test above) then everythin=\r\ng is hunky-dory but\nif I run a test in text mode then a RecordStoreExceptio=\r\nn is thrown\n(presumably because the standard VM doesn&#39;t support the native =\r\nfunctionality\nrequired to create a Database).\n\nSo to summarise - how do I r=\r\nun tests which rely on the KVM (without running\nup an emulator) on a deskto=\r\np.\n\nAny further help much appreciated.\n\nCheers,\nJeremy.\n\n -----Original Mes=\r\nsage-----\nFrom: \tdon_quixada [mailto:xanthus@...] \nSent:\t27 March 200=\r\n2 23:36\nTo:\tjunit@yahoogroups.com\nSubject:\t[junit] Re: j2me unit testing\n\n-=\r\n-- In junit@y..., &quot;Brian Button&quot; &lt;bbutton01@e...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; The reason you u=\r\nse J2MEUnit is that it allows you to test your code \nwith the\n&gt; J2ME KVM.

We=\r\n use Ant for compiling and testing etc whenever \npossible. Ant has a JUnit =\r\noptional-task \n(http://jakarta.apache.org/ant/manual/index.html) and within=\r\n that \ntask there is a choice of what JVM can be used. It defaults \nwith &#39;j=\r\nava&#39;; however, it can easily be changed to &#39;kvm&#39; (if the &#39;kvm&#39; \nstandalone =\r\nVM is installed on your machine-- which it is on mine).\n\nSo... it seems tha=\r\nt there is really no need for J2ME Unit if one can \ntest using JUnit and th=\r\ne KVM. \n\nDo you think that will work?\n\ndq\n\n\n\nTo unsubscribe from this group=\r\n, send an email to:\njunit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n \n\nYour use of Yahoo!=\r\n Groups is subject to http://docs.yahoo.com/info/terms/ \n\n\n\n\n\n",
