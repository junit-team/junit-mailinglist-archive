Of course, some such\ntests might not be useful. For example, assuming you are not\ncreating the xml with your own code, there&#39;s no point in\nchecking that it is valid, but you could  check for strucural\nproblems that could result from bad setup on your part.\n\nOne way to come up with such statements is to think back on\nany issues you have seen in the past. Were some of them\nobservable by instpection of the xml alone, without reference\nto the content of the database? Those could be tests.\n\nCharlie\n\n\n\n",
