If that&#39;s the case, I think<br/>\nselecting a class named &quot;FastTests&quot; and telling your IDE to run it as a<br/>\ntest is easier than fiddling with your JUnit run configurations to specify<br/>\nwhich category to run. Yes, it involves writing a little bit of code to<br/>\ncreate the class, but it&#39;s thankfully very little code. Certainly, the<br/>\ndocumentation could be better, but the wiki is helping with that (please<br/>\ncontribute if you can).<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for parameterized data, I agree that this shouldn&#39;t require a different<br/>\nrunner. Getting parameterized data to work with the same runner as for<br/>\nnormal tests would probably require a major rewrite of a lot of the core<br/>\nJUnit code. If there is a JUnit5 that introduces a different runner model,<br/>\nwe should definitely re-think how parameterized tests are modeled.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- Kevin<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",
