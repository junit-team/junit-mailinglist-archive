It <br/>\nsounds like you guys are trying to compare apples to oranges.  The <br/>\npoint of Java isn&#39;t that it is fast.  I realize that some people want <br/>\nto see how MUCH slower than C++ it is.  That makes sense but then you <br/>\nhave to set some parameters for your test.  Some people would want to <br/>\nknow the &#39;warmed up numbers&#39; for real world capabilities.  Others <br/>\nwould want to know the cold start numbers for &#39;benchmarking&#39; <br/>\nnumbers.
