There&#39;s also an interresting feature that JUnit needs is a <br/>\nmean to count the assert(), assertNotNull(), assertNull()...<br/>\nso some test are heavier than others.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I&#39;ve also noticed but in this case it&#39;s - I believe - included but <br/>\nI haven&#39;t managed to have it working on my tests, is the following :<br/>\nWhen making repetive tests with the same method/TestCase but with <br/>\ndifferent parameters, it&#39;s the need to name the tests to be able to <br/>\nrecognize them.<br/>\nAn example ?<br/>\nSay for instance that I want to test the behavior of a system on the set <br/>\nof Real number where the function should have the following behavior :<br/>\nf(x) gives true :<br/>\n\tx = -infinite , -5[ & [-4, 3] & 5<br/>\n<br/>\nf(x) gives false :<br/>\n\tx = [-5, -4[ & ]3, 5[ & ] 5, + infinite<br/>\n<br/>\nf(x) should throw an exception when x = 5<br/>\n<br/>\nNow I can definitevely write three TestCases.<br/>\n1°. testF_X_OK();<br/>\n2°. testF_X_NOK();<br/>\n3°. testF_X_throws_Exception();<br/>\n<br/>\nbut modify the internal state of my TestCase to reach the requested <br/>\nvalidation*s*It would be nice to put some comments on the TestCase.<br/>\nI belive the TestCase.setName(String aTestCaseName) method is there for <br/>\nthat but I never managed to have it working.<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course ideally, the TestCase.setComment() ethod should come from <br/>\njavadocs... ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThomas,<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nDavid V. Olivier wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; All in all, JUnit has a wonderfully simple and effective user<br/>\n&gt; interface.  There is , however, one behavior that I find troublesome.  This<br/>\n&gt; is the absence of a detailed stack trace when one runs only a single test<br/>\n&gt; case (the second &quot;Run&quot; button).  Instead one only receives pass/fail<br/>\n&gt; information in the status bar (I&#39;m using the Swing UI).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I often find myself in the case where one test of several has failed.  I<br/>\n&gt; make the fix, and then want to test it again.  If I want detailed reporting<br/>\n&gt; I have to run the entire suite.  Some of my tests require time-consuming<br/>\n&gt; set-up operations, and when this is the case the overhead excessive.  Of<br/>\n&gt; course, at some point one needs run the complete suite, but when iterating<br/>\n&gt; between coding and testing it would be nice to have the full functionality<br/>\n&gt; available for running a single test case.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Anyone else have an opinion?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; p.s. Forgive me if this issue has come up before, but I couldn&#39;t find it<br/>\n&gt; the archives.  Also, one might argue that this is more of a development<br/>\n&gt; issue, but since it relates to the user interface, I&#39;ll go ahead and post<br/>\n&gt; it here.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; David Olivier<br/>\n&gt; Naval Research Laboratory<br/>\n&gt; Digital Mapping, Charting & Geodesy Analysis Program<br/>\n&gt; Code 7440.2<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\">junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
