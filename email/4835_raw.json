(LNG-MBC)&quot; \n&gt;&lt;timothy.j.stevens@...&gt;:\n&gt;\n=\r\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; \tCan&#39;t break!!?? You never make typos and return the \n&gt;wrong variabl=\r\ne\n&gt;&gt; in a getter, or set the wrong variable in a setter? If so, you&#39;re a\n&gt;&gt;=\r\n better\n&gt;&gt; coder than me :)\n&gt;\n&gt;I hope this was tongue-in-cheek. I don&#39;t thi=\r\nnk I have *ever* \n&gt;returned the wrong \n&gt;variable from a getX() method[1]. I=\r\nn order to make this \n&gt;mistake, I&#39;d have to be \n&gt;drunk. As for setting the =\r\nwrong variable in a setX() method, \n&gt;see my previous \n&gt;message. I&#39;ve made t=\r\nhat mistake exactly once.\n\nThat&#39;s wonderful. I have made this mistake great=\r\ner than one times (and I wasn&#39;t drunk! :-)\n\n&gt;Folks, don&#39;t test the getX() a=\r\nnd setX() methods; but rather \n&gt;test that the \n&gt;constructor stores the appr=\r\nopriate parameter in the \n&gt;appropriate field. I know \n\nBut isn&#39;t this what =\r\ntesting the setter and getter is doing?? While I am in the minority here, I=\r\n am testing my accessors and I am intending to continue testing my accessor=\r\ns. I have no desire to change your behaviour, but there are other people ou=\r\nt there who are going to read this and ask themselves whether they are wron=\r\ng or paranoid to be testing getters and setters. To these people, I say &quot;Te=\r\nst away!&quot; I have found it useful to test everything that I can. You do not =\r\nfind it useful, so don&#39;t test what you are certain cannot break.\n\n&gt;I&#39;m abou=\r\nt 100 times more likely to write a bug there than in \n&gt;the getX() or setX\n&gt;=\r\n() method itself.\n\nThat&#39;s your personal situation. Some of us still make th=\r\nat mistake.\n\nI&#39;ve been programming since I was in my early teens (1980 if I=\r\n remember correctly) and I still have a couple of mistakes that I make regu=\r\nlarly. My most common one is to forget to increment loop counters. Now that=\r\n&#39;s a dumb mistake and I&#39;m sure that I&#39;m the only person on the list who mak=\r\nes that mistake, but make it I do. Those endless loops always make for lots=\r\n of fun! :-)\n\n&gt;[1] Note that I&#39;m ignoring cases where the compiler caught a=\r\n typo.\n\nNot all languages that junit has been ported to will do that!\n\nSimo=\r\nn\n\n",
