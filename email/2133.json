    "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1447282790\">A test method is partly documentation on how a piece of functionality should<br/>\nwork.  Sometimes I only have to assert one thing against that functionality,<br/>\nbut more often I have to look at many different things to prove that things<br/>\nare hunky dory.  (But there is the notion that if you&#39;re asserting against<br/>\ntoo many different things, your design may not be optimal.)<br/>\n<br/>\nSet up context, do the steps representing the functionality being tested,<br/>\nthen ensure that it worked by asserting A, B, and C.  Breaking this up into<br/>\nthree methods would obscure the intent that executing a single bit of<br/>\nfunctionality results in a specific state.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; several small test methods for the method I am testing<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Don&#39;t view it as testing methods.  Instead consider that you are testing<br/>\nfunctionality.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Jeff L.<br/>\nObject Mentor, Inc.<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Mike Duffy<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSent: 7/26/2001 10:32 AM<br/>\nSubject: RE: [junit] Reporting more then 1 failed assertion per test<br/>\n<br/>\nRegarding the following comment:<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;I guess this whole discussion really boils down to what constitutes<br/>\na test. I choose to organize my tests so that I generally have one<br/>\ntest per tested method, with appropriately many asserts per test. &quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI think it is best to keep methods as concise and as focused as<br/>\npossible (see Refactoring by Fowler, et al; basically, your code will<br/>\nbe more reliable and easier to maintain).  For me, this means writing<br/>\nseveral small test methods for the method I am testing, and at most<br/>\nhaving one assert per test method and sometimes no asserts at all<br/>\n(for example, if you are testing an exception that passes control to<br/>\na catch block, there is no need to put assert(true) in the catch<br/>\nblock).<br/>\n<br/>\nI haven&#39;t really followed the recent thread regarding &quot;Why doesn&#39;t<br/>\nJUnit count asserts&quot;, but I now understand the position of some<br/>\npeople who favor counting asserts.  If you have many asserts in one<br/>\ntest method, counting asserts would give you the number of conditions<br/>\nyou have tested.  However, I think it would be best to put each<br/>\nspecific condition in a seperate test method.  I usually have between<br/>\neight and sixteen test methods for each method I am testing.<br/>\n<br/>\nI use the following naming convention for my test methods to keep<br/>\nthings organized:<br/>\n<br/>\n    test_##_nameOfMethodBeingTested<br/>\n<br/>\nFor example, the eigth test method for the method isAccountAssigned<br/>\nwould be,<br/>\n<br/>\n    test_07_isAccountAssigned</div>",
