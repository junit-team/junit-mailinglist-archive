I have written a<br/>\n&gt; library<br/>\n&gt; of which I need to test one class. The methods exposed by this class<br/>\n&gt; cannot be called randomly but by following some rules. For example,<br/>\n&gt; there is a method &quot;Connect&quot; which must be invoked before any other<br/>\n&gt; method is called. There are additional calls that are related. For<br/>\n&gt; example &quot;ChangeHeaders&quot; makes temporary change to some data (after<br/>\n&gt; some business logic verification), however this must be followed by a<br/>\n&gt; call to &quot;SaveChanges&quot; to persist this data. Whatever I have read<br/>\n&gt; about<br/>\n&gt; JUnit seems to indicate that the test methods in my test class can be<br/>\n&gt; called in any order by the JUnit framework. Is there any way (a<br/>\n&gt; pattern) to get around this issue ? Thanks much in advance..<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>The order of your test methods does not have any bearing on the order in <br/>\nwhich your production code methods are invoked. Each test can be <br/>\nindependent of the others, but still invoke the production code in the <br/>\ncorrect order.<br/>\n<br/>\nCan you sketch a test or two that you can&#39;t see how to write? We could <br/>\ncritique that/give you better suggestions.<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJ. B.
