That is, if for example one thing you need to parse is a\n&gt; color specification, extract that logic into a ColorParser. That makes\n&gt; it both easier to test in isolation, easier to read and maintain and\n&gt; more reusable.\n&gt;\n&gt; Does that help?\n&gt;\n&gt; Cheers, Ilja\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; sunburned.surveyor wrote:\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m still rather new to JUnit (although I&#39;ve purchased at least two\n&gt; &gt; (2) JUnit books)and I&#39;m finally getting around to actually using unit\n&gt; &gt; tests for my code.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;ve ran into a puzzling situation, and I&#39;m looking for suggestions\n&gt; &gt; on how to [1] properly test code using JUnit or [2] refactor my code\n&gt; &gt; so that it can be tested.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The class in question parses a fairly complex text file and\n&gt; &gt; constructs a single Java object from it. There is a single public\n&gt; &gt; parse method that returns an instance of this object. Inside this\n&gt; &gt; public parse method several private helper methods are called.\n&gt; &gt; Basically the job of the public method is to call the private helper\n&gt; &gt; methods in the correct sequence, based on the contents of the file\n&gt; &gt; being parsed.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Here is my question: I want to verify that the logic in parts of\n&gt; &gt; these private helper methods does what I intend. Although I know a\n&gt; &gt; failure of any of these &quot;logic parts&quot; in a private helper method\n&gt; &gt; would be reflected in a failure of the public method. However, I want\n&gt; &gt; to pinpoint which of the &quot;logic parts&quot; failing.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Have I left the realm of unit testing and moved on to some type of\n&gt; &gt; functional testing? Do I need to refactor these &quot;logic parts&quot; into\n&gt; &gt; their own private methods, and then use a framework like JUnitX to\n&gt; &gt; test these private methods? Do I write some beanshell scripts that\n&gt; &gt; test this logic instead?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Thanks for any suggestions on how to proceed. I know this problem is\n&gt; &gt; due to my lack of experience with software testing, and is not a\n&gt; &gt; problem with JUnit.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The Sunburned Surveyor\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Yahoo!
