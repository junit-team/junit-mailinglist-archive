It&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; very little effort, but it&#39;s made the API worse, not better. First of<br/>\n&gt; all it&#39;s more complex and requires more effort to understand. Second,<br/>\n&gt; it&#39;s taken a stable, reliable class and turned it into quicksand. There<br/>\n&gt; are now pieces of it that used to be completely invisible that<br/>\n&gt; developers now have to think about avoiding.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; If the method is internal and may change why expose it to the class&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; clients? Why suggest they use it at all? If it can be private, then make<br/>\n&gt; it so. The only reason I can possibly see for doing this is if it were<br/>\n&gt; somehow important for JUnit&#39;s own classes to override or invoke this<br/>\n&gt; method, but clients were not meant to. Even so, I&#39;d try real hard to<br/>\n&gt; make it package protected or private instead.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>What would you choose to do about an extension point that should<br/>\nonly be used by people who know what they&#39;re doing? You have to<br/>\n/offer/ it as an extension point - eg declare a method as `protected` -<br/>\nbut that doesn&#39;t [have to] mean it&#39;s open for all comers.<br/>\n<br/>\n`internal` means `use at your own risk`. I know you conflate<br/>\nvisibility with publication status, and I understand why, but I<br/>\ndon&#39;t think it&#39;s anywhere as critical/fragile as you do.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nChris &quot;it&#39;s all paraphernalia&quot; Dollin<br/>\nson of a gun, listen to the plants, breathless.<br/>\nshifting sands - life in the fast lane.</div>",
