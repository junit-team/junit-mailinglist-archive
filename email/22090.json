E.g.: run all tests that are not in (a) certain category(s)? This is<br/>\n&gt; probably not difficult add in one way or another onto the concept of<br/>\n&gt; categories, but the answer to &quot;which test is now acctually included&quot; could<br/>\n&gt; become confusing in cases where a test is in an included and an excluded<br/>\n&gt; category. I would like to see something here that does not require a lot of<br/>\n&gt; browsing through hierarchies of suites nad categories. This may in my<br/>\n&gt; approach not well solved either as suites can extend on other suites: if a<br/>\n&gt; referenced suite includes a certain test, it is executed even if the<br/>\n&gt; extending suite excludes a test.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; And more fundamentally: is the idea/need of exclusion meaningfull or just a<br/>\n&gt; result of badly organising tests (I&#39;d say no, but I may be wrong)?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>For what it&#39;s worth, excluding tests is a very popular TestNG features.  For<br/>\nexample, I use it when a few tests are broken and need to remain so for a<br/>\nwhile:  I put them in the group &quot;broken&quot;, which I always exclude during my<br/>\nruns.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen the time to ship approaches, I look at all the tests in the &quot;broken&quot;<br/>\ncategory and I go fix them then.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n***Cédric<br/>\n*<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",
