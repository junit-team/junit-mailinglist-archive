It keeps me from putting too much code in the UI and ease the\ntesting (the tests are simply considered as yet another client).\n\nI would write a DBAccess class that deals with generating the SQL code (use\nPrepareStatement instead of Statement: it&#39;s nicer and less error prone) and has\nsome public methods.  You can now easily test your SQL code and your Swing\ninterface will hopefully become really easy (and you could skip your testing if\nyou&#39;re confident).\n\nThe advantage of this approach is that you can now have different drivers for\ndifferent dbs (like an XML db).  And on top of that you can reuse the same\ntests to validate all your drivers!  Isn&#39;t that a nice solution?\n\nTip : Constructors can call other constructors:\npublic AddState(java.awt.Dialog parent, boolean modal, int id_State) {\n   this(parent, modal);\n   id = id_State;\n}\nor (I prefer this version)\npublic AddState(java.awt.Dialog parent, boolean modal) {\n   this(parent, modal, NO_STATE);\n}\n\nhth\n\n-Vladimir\n\r\n--\nVladimir Bossicard\nwww.bossicard.com\n\n",
