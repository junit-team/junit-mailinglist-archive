Then you can put the reparse\n&gt; of your file in setUp(), which -- as someone said earlier -- makes the\n&gt; intent obvious.\n\nThat leads to class proliferation that makes it hard to locate the test \nI want when I want it. I have to guess which file is likely to contain \nthe test for which functionality based on arbitrary details like what \nfixtures it uses. As it is, I know that tests for the Element class can \nbe found in the ElementTest class, tests for attributes go in the \nAttribute class, tests for XPath go in the XPathTest class. Not perfect, \nbut it  makes it a lot easier to find what I&#39;m looking far.\n\nA few minutes ago on another mailing list, somebody asked me a question \nabout a complicated detail in XPath parsing. Basically he proposed \noptimizing evaluation by using a  &quot;theorem&quot; I knew to be false. I didn&#39;t \nremember exactly why the theorem was false, but I knew I had a \ncounterexample in a test case. Sure enough, a quick glance through the \nXPathTest class revealed the counterexample. Now if I had had to hunt \nthrough 12 different classes to try to find the right test case, I still \ncould have done it; but it would have taken a lot longer.\n\nTest suites serve double duty as documentation for a program. They serve \nthis task better if they&#39;re cleanly organized by functionality rather \nthan by implementation details like which fixtures they do and don&#39;t set up.\n\n-- \nElliotte Rusty Harold  elharo@...\nXML in a Nutshell 3rd Edition Just Published!\nhttp://www.cafeconleche.org/books/xian3/\nhttp://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0596007647/cafeaulaitA/ref=nosim\n\n",
