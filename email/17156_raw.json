The\ntest case instances would be constructed at some time before the test was\nrun. Consider a test which allocated a limited external resource. If I\ncreated more than one test case of a given class, there would potentially be\na conflict. SetUp(), on the other hand, is guaranteed to be run just before\nthe test method, so it is safe to allocated external resources in setUp().\nWith JUnit 4, the test case instances are guaranteed to be created one at a\ntime, as they are run, so this argument no longer holds.\n \nA second argument for setUp() is symmetry. Allocating resources in setUp()\nand de-allocating them in tearDown() is nicely symmetric, whereas allocating\nthem in a constructor and de-allocating them in tearDown() is not. If you\ndon&#39;t have to de-allocate any resources, then this argument no longer holds.\n\n \nI&#39;ll be experimenting with initializing test cases in field declarations and\nconstructors to see if I like them better that way. In general, I am a fan\nof expressing code a declaratively as possible, which argues in this\ndirection.\n \nCheers,\n \nKent Beck\nThree Rivers Institute\n\n\n  _____  \n\nFrom: junit@yahoogroups.com [mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com] On Behalf Of\nclgonsal\nSent: Monday, July 17, 2006 4:08 PM\nTo: junit@yahoogroups.com\nSubject: [junit] setUp versus constructors\n\n\n\nI&#39;ve been using JUnit for a few years now, and one thing that&#39;s always\nbothered me is the &quot;setUp&quot; method.\n\nI always do my initialization in my constructor (if I&#39;m not just doing\nit at the field definition) as constructors allow me to initialize\nfinal fields. The semantics of using a constructor also seem far more\nobvious to me as everyone reading my code knows Java, while not\neveryone is a JUnit guru.\n\nThe additional complexity of having the (as far as I can tell)\nredundant setUp method seems counterproductive, so why does setUp exist?\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n",
