But it was *never* legitimate to make a virtue\n&gt;  &gt; of necessity, to say (as you do) that &quot;separation is the solution.&quot;\n&gt;  &gt; Now that you *can* drive your UIs from JUnit, and therefore you can\n&gt;  &gt; *fully* test your UIs, your claim is illegitimate, and moreover\n&gt;  &gt; encourages the &quot;anti-test-infection.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; I resemble this remark, and it&#39;s hard to refute.\n&gt; \n&gt; I still don&#39;t have the necessary skill to do very well what Thomas rightly\n&gt; recommends, but I believe that he&#39;s right.\n\nSeparation is, however, a majority of the solution. It is easily 80% of \nthe solution, if not more. I hope that readers do not interpret your \nremark to mean that separation is ineffective.\n\nI used not to know how to write object tests for dynamic web page \ntemplates, and after a few projects spent making those templates too \nsimple to break, I felt confident enough to try testing them. That&#39;s how \nit went for me: when I tried testing them, the cost of failure was low, \nbecause so much of the logic involved with the user interface was \nalready tested elsewhere. That gave me the confidence not to worry about \n  whether my UI testing was adequate--if it wasn&#39;t, then that wasn&#39;t the \nend of the world.\n\nIt turns out that writing object tests for web page templates isn&#39;t that \ndifficult. It turns out that writing object tests for Swing UIs isn&#39;t \nthat difficult, either (thanks to Dave Astels). That&#39;s not to say, \nthough, that the journey through &quot;I can&#39;t do it, so I&#39;ll make my UI too \nsimple to break&quot; wasn&#39;t well worth it.\n-- \nJ. B.
