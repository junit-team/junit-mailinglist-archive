Let me back up and explain\nwhy I was trying this approach.\n\nThe Class:\nI have a class that represents a table row in a database, lets call it\nTableRowContainer.  Instead of hardcoding many classes for each table in the\ndatabase, I have one class that can represent a row in any of them as long as\nyou pass in a table meta data class that explains what a row in a certain table\nshould be like.  \n\nThe Test:\nSo to test this I write TableRowContainerTest.  It uses a specific meta data\nclass, fakes some data for it, and then tests the public methods.\n\nThe Problem:\nThe only problem is that I don&#39;t think that it is sufficient just to have the\none hard coded meta data class, I want to test TableRowContainer with all of them.\n\nBad Solutions:\nMy first thought was to make a constructor in TableRowContainerTest that would\ntake a meta data class.  In a separate class, I iterate through a list of these\nmeta data classes (which I get by looking through the file system).  I construct\nan instance of TableRowContainerTest with each piece of meta data, and run the\ntests on each one.  This doesn&#39;t work for a number of reasons that I have\npreviously mentioned.\nIt is not that I am wanting to pass data from one test to the other.  It is that\nTableRowContainerTest is setup to run it&#39;s tests in the context of a single type\nof meta data.  I need an outside class to construct an instance of\nTableRowContainerTest with each meta data class and test it.\nTableRowContainer is not itself setup to run through all of the meta data\nclasses mainly because it extends from EqualsHashCodeTest in the JUnit addons as\na way to test the equals and hashcode for free.  in other words\nTableRowContainerTest tests a single type of TableRowContainer.  But I have many\nthat I would like to construct and check.\n\nGood Solution:\nI still don&#39;t see one.\nI guess that it would be possible to sublcass TableRowContainerTest for each\ninstance of the meta data that I would otherwise construct an instance around. \nBut this is a lot of extra classes for no reason other than to get around a\nlimitation in JUnit.\nI could also have a static variable that I repeatedly update to the new meta\ndata, and then run the tests.  But this could get into some tricky threading\nissues.  But again I am not sure how I would update the variable and run the\ntests, and get the TestResults to come out appropriately.\n\nIs it so wrong to want to instantiate a test with some parameters and\nautomatically run the tests on it?  I completely feel like I am missing\nsomething here.  Of course I am new to Unit Testing.  It was trivially easy\nuntil I came across this problem.  Now it feels like I am fighting with JUnit,\nand I know that I must not be thinking about this right.  I can&#39;t find any\ninformation on this type of problem.  Parameterized TestCase is close, but I\ndon&#39;t want to override runTest().  I want the reflective base functionality to\nrun all methods named test* automatically, and for the results to show up\nappropriately.\n\nI appreciate the reply.  I could really use some guidance on this if anyone has\nanything to add.\nThanks,\nClay\n\n\n&gt; \n&gt; junityahoo@... wrote:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; So I write my first TestCase class.  Lets call it MyTestCase.  It works \n&gt; &gt; great by\n&gt; &gt; itself.  It fakes some data that it will need, then runs through some \n&gt; &gt; tests to\n&gt; &gt; make sure everything works right.  Great!\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Now what I want to do is instantiate MyTestCase from another TestCase \n&gt; &gt; and have\n&gt; &gt; it run through the tests.\n&gt; \n&gt; Stop!\n&gt; \n&gt; Don&#39;t do this. If you want to share data between tests, then make that \n&gt; data globally available from another resource, such as a file, a global \n&gt; variable, a database, whatever works.\n&gt; \n&gt; Do /not/ run tests from within other tests. You won&#39;t get the results \n&gt; you want, anyway.\n&gt; -- \n&gt; J. B.
