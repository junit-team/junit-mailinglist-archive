I just happen to work here. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nJBuilder 4.0 foundation is built to have partially-completed features, <br/>\nas far as I believe.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you have the advanced version (Professional or Enterprise), you will <br/>\nhave the ability to filter the classes that you don&#39;t want to go to.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for the usage of debugger, I found it very useful when an assertion <br/>\nfailed unexpectedly, because I can check out the states of the instances <br/>\nto see where it went wrong.  Then I will add proper assertion statement <br/>\nto my test code, or even add another testing method so that next time <br/>\nthe assertion will occur as early as possible.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nDisclaimer:  I join all the news groups out of my own interest.

Well, after fighting<br/>\n&gt;with the IDE for months now, I have come to the conclusion that, for lack of<br/>\n&gt;better verbiage, jBuilder&#39;s (4.0) debugger is flaky.  The debugger<br/>\n&gt;constantly goes into code that it shouldn&#39;t, and actually forces me to go<br/>\n&gt;back to using the old System.out method of debugging, how wasteful!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Does anyone know of a decent debugger?
