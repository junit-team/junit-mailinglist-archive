It seems that there is <br/>\n&gt; always another test case I should test for. Having this many <br/>\n&gt; methods becomes unmanageable. The situation gets ugly.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I think your problem is more in the lines of: Having so many methods *in<br/>\nthe same class*, not necessarily the fact that you have many methods.<br/>\n<br/>\nTherefore, the best option to you is to Refactor.  Try moving logically<br/>\nrelated test methods to an appropriately named test class.  Following<br/>\nyour example earlier:<br/>\n<br/>\npublic class TestCreateBatchLabelNoInnerClass extends TestCase {<br/>\n   public void testNo1 {...} // Of course I would name the test<br/>\n   public void testNo2 {...} // methods more appropriately<br/>\n   ...<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; This approach suffers from two limitations. The first <br/>\n&gt; limitation is the need to replicate the test code for every <br/>\n&gt; test case.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>With the approach detailed above, all you need is a bit of cut and paste<br/>\n(or even better, a good Refactoring tool to do it for you).<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; The second limitation is that JUnit will stop the testing <br/>\n&gt; after the first failure-the remaining test cases won&#39;t be executed.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Again, the approach above avoids this problem.<br/>\n<br/>\nManuel Amago.<br/>\nmailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mamago@...\">mamago@...</a></div>",
