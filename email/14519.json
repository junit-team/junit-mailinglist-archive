Most of my &quot;concrete&quot; classes implement more<br/>\nthan one of these interfaces.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, I was hoping to find a way to refactor my tests so that each<br/>\ninterface has its own abstract TestCase. Then, if multiple inheritance<br/>\nwas allowed in Java, I could simply implement each classes concrete<br/>\nclasse&#39;s TestCase by inheriting from all the appropriate &quot;interface<br/>\nTestCases&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis would allow me to inherit all the general purpose fixtures and<br/>\nsimply add some new fixtures targeted for the concrete classe&#39;s<br/>\nspecific behavior. In a way, I simply want to enforce the &quot;Liskov<br/>\nSubstitution Principle&quot; as simply as possible...<br/>\n<br/>\nI know multiple inheritance isn&#39;t allowed in Java and should be<br/>\navoided anyway but I&#39;d like to find a simple way to keep the general<br/>\nidea of &quot;interface specific super TestCases&quot; and apply it to classes<br/>\nimplementing several of these interfaces.<br/>\n<br/>\nIs the general idea a good one ? If it is, what is  the best way to achieve it ?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks in advance,<br/>\n<br/>\nD.</div>",
