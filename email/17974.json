Is it good to make a assertTrue(), assertEquals<br/>\n&gt;&gt; () etc. in the setUp() or tearDown() methode?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve felt a need for this only rarely. In one situation, all tests  <br/>\nneeded the precondition that a certain file did not exist. The setUp  <br/>\nmethod deleted this file and then verified that it wasn&#39;t there.<br/>\n<br/>\nI found the assertion was valuable because sometimes files weren&#39;t  <br/>\nable to be deleted. (Maybe my problem would have been better solved by  <br/>\neliminating the dependency on the file system.)<br/>\n<br/>\nTo echo other posters, normally I wouldn&#39;t put assertions in setup,  <br/>\nbut they can prove valuable in terms of documenting preconditions.<br/>\n<br/>\nJeff</div>",
