I=\r\nt was just \ntoo fragile, and every time I set things up I got that annoying=\r\n error \nabout the classpath, which seems to be saying &quot;it is your fault, an=\r\nd \nyou&#39;re an idiot, so don&#39;t bother us&quot;. Once I made my own test suite as \n=\r\na static instance, managed the TestResult object myself and added a \nTestLi=\r\nstener instance, a whole bunch of this stuff became much, much \neasier.\n\nIn=\r\ncluding this.\n\nThe TestListener instance has access to every test as it is =\r\nrun. So, at \nthat point, you can have something you log, however much of it=\r\n you \nwant. One can even have an external source of information at that \npo=\r\nint. We have a database of our tests and I can query that in the \nTestListe=\r\nner and annotate the results with whatever stuff I want.\n\nI frankly do not =\r\nknow whether junitreport can do these things. But it \njust puts out html. I=\r\n can do that well enough myself, once i have the \ninformation.\n\n- ray\n\nOn A=\r\nug 16, 2004, at 9:44 AM, valerie_abelin wrote:\n\n&gt; I&#39;m using Ant to run juni=\r\nt and junitreport.=A0 I like the HTML output\n&gt;  that junitreport generates,=\r\n but I am wondering if it is possible to\n&gt;  include more javadoc/comments i=\r\nn the output rather than just the\n&gt;  success/failure status and time the te=\r\nst took to run.=A0 It would be\n&gt;  great if junitreport could include a comm=\r\nent from the source code\n&gt;  about what each test means.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n[Non-text p=\r\nortions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\n\n\n",
