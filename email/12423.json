I did need it<br/>\n&gt; to be static and didn&#39;t intially conceive that JUnit invokes all the<br/>\n&gt; testXXX methods in quick succession (In their own threads?), this did<br/>\n&gt; cause some &#39;interesting&#39; contention issues within the reused object<br/>\n&gt; (resolved with the addition of a small synchronisation block).  The<br/>\n&gt; sync issue means some more tests are needed.  Oh joy 8).<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;m glad you found a solution, but just as a note, the tests run in <br/>\nsingle-threaded mode, so it might just be that they&#39;re running quickly. <br/>\nThis can be a problem if, for example, one test is deleting from the <br/>\nfile system and the next test wants to create the same file. In this <br/>\ncase, you usually need to tell your tests to sleep a little. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nTake care.<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJ. B.
