I am not surprised as<br/>\nrunning CppUnit (Eclipse on Windows with CDT) I found it too flaky to<br/>\ncount on. Is this because the group doesn&#39;t see C++ as a future<br/>\nlanguage? It might not be. I lobbied to use Real-Time Java instead<br/>\nof C++, to no avail. Later, when it was too late to change, the<br/>\nproject manager told me Java would have been a better choice.<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In junit@yahoogroups. &lt;mailto:junit%40yahoogroups.com&gt; com, &quot;Kent Beck&quot;<br/>\n&lt;kentb@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; All,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; At the Agile Open Northwest conference I held an open space session<br/>\n </span></blockquote>on the<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; future of testing tools.
