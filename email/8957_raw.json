For each method being tested, only one corresponding\n&gt; &gt; method in the test class will be generated.\n&gt; \n&gt; Yes. But that&#39;s nonsense - don&#39;t use those automatically generated \ntest\n&gt; methods.\n\nIt is still not too bad to have it generate test class template. Now \nit seems that we need to extend the template to include more test \ncases.\n\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; However, for each method\n&gt; &gt; being tested, there are quite a few test cases. Do I need to \ncreate a\n&gt; &gt; new test method for each test case?\n&gt; \n&gt; You do not really *need* to, but I would strongly advice you to do \nso.\n&gt; It makes maintaining the tests much easier.\n&gt; \n\nActually I believe that it is common issue. Seldom a method has just \none test case. \n\n&gt; &gt; Given the above code snippet as\n&gt; &gt; example, do I need to separate DumpOutputTest into \nDumpOuputTestOne()\n&gt; &gt; and DumpOutputTestTwo()? \n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;d rather name them after the behaviour you want to test. Possibly\n&gt; something along the lines of testDumpOutputForAbc and\n&gt; testDumpOutputForXyz. You can certainly find better names.\n&gt; \n\nI used One and Two just for illustration here. Your suggestion is \nstill quite valuable for me.\n\nThanks a lot for your input!\n\n\n\n\n",
