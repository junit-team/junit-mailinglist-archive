I had attended a\n&gt; presentation by Robert &quot;Uncle Bob&quot; Martin on Test Dri=\r\nven\n&gt; development. I think the exact example was a program to keep track\n&gt; =\r\nof a bowling game score. Presenting the Big view object model and\n&gt; one don=\r\ne through incremental, test driven development, the later was\n&gt; much simple=\r\nr. It only required the creation of objects needed to\n&gt; solve the problem r=\r\nather then the apparent objects and their\n&gt; behaviour.\n\nI have no doubt tha=\r\nt TDD works great on such simple problems and that it can\neven lead to a re=\r\nasonable design. Then again, the problem space is so small\nthat you can arg=\r\nue that no design will really be wrong anyway...\n\nNow consider a more reali=\r\nstic example, such as an application that is\ndealing with five database tab=\r\nles, each with four to ten columns, each of\nwhich needs to be mapped to Jav=\r\na objects in a sensible way (i.e. not\nnecessarily mapping the tables and th=\r\ne objects one-to-one) and should also\ninclude business methods and objects =\r\nto make it easier to perform\ndomain-specific operations.\n\nUsing TDD to driv=\r\ne such a design is guaranteed to lead to an architecture\nthat will be focus=\r\ned on solving micro-problems and that will totally miss\nthe big picture. Yo=\r\nu are much better off spending a few minutes with a\npiece of paper or a whi=\r\nte board to design your classes and your object\ndiagram.\n\nIf you want to us=\r\ne TDD to implement this model after that, fine, but I\nreally dispute the id=\r\nea that TDD should drive the design in the general\ncase, because TDD simply=\r\n never gives you the big picture.\n\nMakes sense?\n\n-- \nC=E9dric\nhttp://testng=\r\n. &lt;http://testng.org&gt; org\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been rem=\r\noved]\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n",
