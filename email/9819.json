Obviously each &#39;object&#39; can have its own state<br/>\n&gt; but through static attributes each class can have its own state<br/>\n&gt; also.

You do this to avoid contamination between tests.  Clearly<br/>\nyou could reinitialize static variables for use as part of a fixture.<br/>\nBut it&#39;s cleaner to create brand-new objects for use in the fixture.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you use static variables of the TestCase, you have to be careful.  If<br/>\nyou create new objects, you don&#39;t have to think so much.  So create new<br/>\nobjects.  Who wants to think?<br/>\n<br/>\n;-)<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJim Dixon  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jdd@...\">jdd@...</a>   tel +44 117 982 0786  mobile +44 797 373 7881</div>",
