Using a contract<br/>\nprogramming strategy can be dangerous because some new requirements should<br/>\narise during the project development and anyone can imagine what could<br/>\nhappen to all interfaces if some interdependecies between the various entity<br/>\nhasn&#39;t been taken into account or sone new ones arise.<br/>\n<br/>\nBye,<br/>\nLuca Sfarzo<br/>\nTRS<br/>\nItaly<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Vladimir Bossicard&quot; &lt;vladimir@...&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;junit@yahoogroups.com&gt;<br/>\nSent: Saturday, March 09, 2002 7:05 AM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [junit] Where to place test classes?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; I don&#39;t want to start another &quot;holy war&quot;...  just presenting another POV:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; if your production classes are located unter a src/ directory, just<br/>\n&gt; mirror your hierarchy in a test/ directory.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; you will have then: src/edu/washington/library/Book.java<br/>\n&gt; and your test in  : test/edu/washington/library/BookTest.java<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; You will be able to test your public interface, striped them when<br/>\n&gt; dealing with the release but you will be able to:<br/>\n&gt; - test your protected methods<br/>\n&gt; - easily generate Javadoc with Ant (as far as I know, the Javadoc Ant<br/>\n&gt; task can&#39;t deal with FileSets, so it&#39;s impossible (?) to only include<br/>\n&gt; your production classes in your javadoc documentation)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; You can have a look at some really well organized projects (those of<br/>\n&gt; Jakarta for example - http://jakarta.apache.org) and see by yourself.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; But it&#39;s a matter of taste.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -Vladimir<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --<br/>\n&gt; Vladimir Bossicard<br/>\n&gt; www.bossicard.com<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:<br/>\n&gt; junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
