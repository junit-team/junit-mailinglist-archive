I think to be useful \nby the mainstream programmer, it *needs* to be automatic.  Eclipse (et \nal.) have allowed thousands of programmers who were never able to \neffectively refactor &quot;by hand&quot; to use those utilities to improve their \ncode.\n\nI doubt more than an elite few are able to properly analyze package and \nclass dependencies (with or without tools) and without fully \nintegrating the analysis, you&#39;d see very few make use of the \ninformation for tests.\n\nI think such a test suite organization is essential, because the \n(semi-old) adage &quot;make your tests run faster&quot; doesn&#39;t always work, and \neven the most rabid proponents of that adage admit to sometimes only \nrunning a subset of their test suite.\n\n\n\nOn Jul 16, 2004, at 5:07 PM, Vlad Roubtsov wrote:\n\n&gt; On any but the trivial projects the number of\n&gt; testcases quickly exceeds 100-200+. It usually takes a\n&gt; noticeable time to run them all. It is also less\n&gt; efficient to do so because it ignores the idea of\n&gt; levelization (from John Lakos&#39; underappreciated book\n&gt; &quot;Large Scale C++ Software Design&quot;). In incremental dev\n&gt; mode it would be more efficient to execute only the\n&gt; testcases that correspond to the product package(s)\n&gt; that&#39;s just changed (and the dependency closure\n&gt; thereof) AND execute them in increasing level numbers\n&gt; (reverse package dependency topological order).\n&gt;\n&gt; It has been my experience that individual developers\n&gt; on a team don&#39;t normally pay attention to the concept\n&gt; of levelization. In the framework I use I can control\n&gt; testcase ordering via a simple text file and I can\n&gt; group individual testcases into sub-suites that I can\n&gt; also include/order via the same text syntax. However,\n&gt; this is a very manual process and hard to instill as a\n&gt; team practice.\n&gt;\n&gt; A tool/framework that enforces test (sub)suite\n&gt; execution in increasing level numbers would seem like\n&gt; the next evolutionary step after naive TDD. Does\n&gt; anyone know of such a tool? The testcase-&gt;app package\n&gt; assignment could be done by simply placing testcases\n&gt; in the relevant package (common practice already\n&gt; anyway) or by something like Java 1.5 metadata\n&gt; tagging.\n&gt;\n&gt; There are tools to analyze existing package\n&gt; dependencies, but I am not aware of a test framework\n&gt; to actually relate that data to testcase execution\n&gt; ordering.\n&gt;\n&gt; References:\n&gt;\n&gt; http://www.braithwaite-lee.com/opinions/levelization.html\n&gt; http://javacentral.compuware.com/pasta/concepts/packageDesign.html\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt; Vlad.\n&gt;\n&gt; __________________________________________________\n&gt; Do You Yahoo!?\n&gt; Tired of spam?
