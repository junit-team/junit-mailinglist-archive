Are you going to pass all these<br/>\n&gt; parameters in the constructor, store them in a separate field and<br/>\n </span></blockquote>then have<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; each method use the particular field they need?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>No, I would have seperate test classes in this instance. Yes, it&#39;s a<br/>\nlimitation, but only a mild one. Most likely, particularly if I&#39;m<br/>\nwriting a suite() method to call the constructors anyway, I&#39;d making<br/>\nthese test classes private inner classes so that I don&#39;t end up with a<br/>\ncluttered source tree.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; The idea that I have to have tests run in a particular <br/>\n&gt; &gt; order to get repeatability strikes me as odd as well<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Why would you need to do that?  We are just talking about being able<br/>\n </span></blockquote>to pass<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; parameters to test methods.  The order in which these methods are<br/>\n </span></blockquote>invoked is<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; irrelevant...  right?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>No.<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst, yes, I was shifting the argument a bit to counter-inituitive<br/>\nbehaviour. But I was just following you there.<br/>\n<br/>\nSecondly, if it was irrelevant, you wouldn&#39;t have the &quot;requires&quot;<br/>\nannotation (I forget exactly the semantics) in TestNG; the purpose of<br/>\nthat annotation is to ensure that _known_ requirements are done first,<br/>\nnot just to ensure that required functionality is working, but to set<br/>\nup known state.<br/>\n<br/>\nThirdly, if you&#39;ve got methods in a class that can leave state behind,<br/>\nthen you&#39;ve got an implicit ordering from side effects. As I said, I<br/>\nfind it counter intuitive that I have to be careful about side effects<br/>\nin my test cases. End of digression... though I&#39;ll be happy to<br/>\ncontinue if we spawn a new thread.<br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; Have you thought about an option like this?<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; @ParameterList({ &quot;oneName&quot; }, {&quot;anotherName&quot;}, {&quot;aThirdName&quot;}) <br/>\n&gt; &gt; @Test public void testSingleString(String firstName) { ...<br/>\n&gt; &gt; }<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; You mean defining the various values in the source itself?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>As an option. Not the only option, but one available under the right<br/>\ncircumstances.<br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; No, I hadn&#39;t thought about it, but it&#39;s an intriguing idea.  My first<br/>\n&gt; reaction is that it would force me to recompile my source file<br/>\n </span></blockquote>whenever I<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; want to change or add a parameter, but I can see how a JUnit user<br/>\n </span></blockquote>wouldn&#39;t<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; mind that :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Or an Eclipse user... after all, it will recompile when I save. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe main advantage here is that if you only got a few interesting<br/>\ncases to look for, you can keep them with the source code.<br/>\nFurthermore, once I finished building the test, it&#39;s not like I&#39;m<br/>\njumping back in and editing it a lot anyway.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; The vast majority of times I want a parameterised test, I <br/>\n&gt; &gt; don&#39;t really want a _lot_ of parameters, but I&#39;m not sure I&#39;d <br/>\n&gt; &gt; want to muck around with defining the parameters in the XML <br/>\n&gt; &gt; either;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Fair enough, I&#39;m open to hearing suggestions, but I really think<br/>\n </span></blockquote>that you<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; need a way to be able to invoke the same test class with different<br/>\n </span></blockquote>values<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; for parameters.  How would you like to do that?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Annotations in the code _as an option_ works. Supplementing the<br/>\nexisting XML and programatic techniques.<br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Most users simply invoke TestNG from ant or from the command line<br/>\n </span></blockquote>and they<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; never write a single line of XML.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Unless they start doing something fancy... ;) Of course, JUnit starts<br/>\nasking you to grow beyond the default behaviour as well, so that&#39;s a<br/>\nbit of a fallacious argument.<br/>\n<br/>\nRobert.</div>",
