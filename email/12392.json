The simplest solution <br/>\nwould be to use a class-level variable on your TestCase class.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease note two things, though:<br/>\n<br/>\n1. By default, you don&#39;t have control over the order in which tests are <br/>\nexecuted, so it could be that the &quot;reading&quot; test is executing before the <br/>\n&quot;writing&quot; test. If you want this control, I recommend using GSBase&#39;s <br/>\nOrderedTestSuite to control the order of some of your tests.<br/>\n<br/>\n2. The desire to share data between tests (meaning that one test writes <br/>\nto a variable and another test reads it) goes against the basic <br/>\nphilosophy of JUnit and the xUnit frameworks. They were designed so that <br/>\ntests would be /isolated/ from one another, because there are all kinds <br/>\nof benefits from keeping tests isolated. To learn more about this, look <br/>\nat the books _JUnit Recipes_ and _Test-Driven Development: By Example_, <br/>\namong others.<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJ. B.
