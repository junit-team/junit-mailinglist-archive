At worst you would have some duplication of effort and at best<br/>\nyou would have someone who would catch test cases the developer didn&#39;t. Same<br/>\ncould be said of pair programming, and that seems to work for some people.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t see any conflict either, whether it is done as part of a pair<br/>\nprogramming effort or as a totally independent effort. Where do you see the<br/>\nconflict?<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, if you also have another person writing unit tests at the same time the<br/>\ncode is being developed, then you get the benefit of a second pair of<br/>\nindependent and fresh unbiased eyes. After all, we have code walkthroughs<br/>\nand peer reviews right? If every developer could see the errors in their<br/>\ncode and develop tests to exclude them, then what is the purpose of those<br/>\npractices? Such practices are just another form of testing.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I do sometimes worry though that my testcode doesn&#39;t test the boundary<br/>\ncases too well since it is<br/>\n&gt; not my dedicated job to make the code break.  But, with TDD my code is<br/>\n90-100% tested whereas<br/>\n&gt; therwise it would be 10% (if that).  That is such a marked improvement<br/>\nthat I think it is well worth it,<br/>\n&gt; even without independent testing.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am not arguing against TDD, or arguing that independent unit testing<br/>\nwould/should replace TDD - far from it. I am saying that independent unit<br/>\ntesting has its own value and serves as another very important early filter<br/>\nfor bugs in code and designs. Again, the earlier you find a bug, the better,<br/>\nand it is well worth the extra effort - unless the effort doesn&#39;t find bugs,<br/>\nwhich I seriously doubt.<br/>\n<br/>\nFWIW,<br/>\nLauren<br/>\n<br/>\n=====<br/>\nLooking for an experienced Java/C++ Software Engineer?<br/>\nSee: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://developerdude.mystarband.net/resume.html\">http://developerdude.mystarband.net/resume.html</a> </span></blockquote></div>",
