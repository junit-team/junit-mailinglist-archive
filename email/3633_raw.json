Without a testcase here, there will be a more\ncomplex failure somewhere else. Somebody will spend an hour or so pulling\ntheir hair out. A testcase for this is very quick to do. It also has the\nside effect of making sure things still work after someone changes one of\nthe accessors to return a computed value and forgets to add the test. The\npoint of regression is to catch problems that arise from someone who makes\na change forgetting to do everything they should.\n\nMost bugs are trivial mistakes. Most people pay attention when coding\ncomplex things and suspect the complex code when something goes wrong.\nWhen people write trivial or repetitive code, their attention drifts and\nthey make mistakes. The trivial code also happens to be the last place\nsomeone looks for the mistake, as evidenced by this discussion.\n\nOn Fri, 21 Dec 2001, STRAYER, JON (AIT) wrote:\n\n&gt; Do you test that 1 + 1 = 2 just in case the compiler makes a mistake?  Then\n&gt; why test a simple getter?  Sure, if the value returned is calculated then\n&gt; test it.  If the value stored is the result of some calculation then test\n&gt; it.  But that&#39;s not what was presented.\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; To this I would respond that most bugs are introduced as unforeseen\n&gt; &gt; consequences of modification to existing code.  There may be\n&gt; &gt; interdependencies that we weren&#39;t aware of.  Most bugs seem\n&gt; &gt; obvious once they&#39;re discovered.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; int getFoo() {return foo;}\n&gt;\n&gt; What kind of interdependencies are there going to be?\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; And besides testing get methodds are generally pretty darn easy.  In\n&gt; &gt; response to the question &quot;Why do it?&quot; I say &quot;Why not do it?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; What does the buy you?\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
