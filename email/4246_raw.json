So I started testing my Classes through this\ntool.\n\nBut I got a problem as mentioned below:\n\n   I have installed the junit and was able to get the userinterface of\nTestRunner but when I am giving the name of the test class in it, it is\nthrowing an error stating the class was not found and check the\nconfiguration of  &quot;Test collector&quot;. Could u please suggest me the solution\nand how to get the result.\n\nThanks in advance,\nPratap.\n\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nSend and receive Hotmail on your mobile device: http://mobile.msn.com\n\n\n",
