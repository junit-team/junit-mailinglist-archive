Actually I like it. You can never lose track of the \n    &gt; tests, and you can\n    &gt; run them in (pre-)production if you want, just to ensure \n    &gt; that production env\n    &gt; (soft&hardware) behaves like dev.\n\nThis can be accomplished without having the tests side-by-side with your\nproduction code.  Just include them in the release.\n \n    &gt; Because we have a naming convention where every test \n    &gt; class name begins with\n    &gt; &quot;Test&quot;, it&#39;s also pretty easy to manipulate them when exporting.\n    &gt; Why hide the tests? I&#39;m proud of them! :) And I want them \n    &gt; to be seen right\n    &gt; aside the class they test, so it gives a visual clue that \n    &gt; they need to\n    &gt; follow the evolution of the class. Anyway.... :)\n\nA moot point from my perspective, but your mileage probably varies.\n\n-Jason\n\n\n",
