I thought I could \njust have a number of Decorators and add them to the suite so that in \nturn the tests are run instead each decorator.  Example of suite.\n\n    public static Test suite()\n    {\n        TestSuite suite = new TestSuite(&quot;Some Tests&quot;);\n\n        suite.addTest(new TestSetupA(new TestSuite(MyTests.class)));\n        suite.addTest(new TestSetupB(new TestSuite(MyTests.class)));\n        \n        .\n        .\n        .\n\n        suite.addTest(new TestSetupX(new TestSuite(MyTests.class)));\n\n        return suite;\n    }\n\nSo in this case I use TestSetupA to create an environment that all \nthe test cases in MyTests are run inside.  I then create a new \nenvironment using TestSetupB for the same test cases etc.\n\nThe problem I am having is that for every TestSetup decorator I add \nit makes the tests run that many times.  If I have 3 decorators then \nTestSetupA.setUp() is run 3 times. Then all the test cases are run 3 \ntimes, then TestSetupA.tearDown() 3 times.  After that \nTestSetupB.setUp() is called 3 times, then all tests are run 3 times \nand TestSetupB.tearDown() 3 times, etc.\n\nWhy is this happening, is it a bug or is there another was I should \nsolve this solution of running the test cases in different \nenvironments?\n\nThanks for any information (esp. if you understand me :)\n\n Tony\n\n\n",
