This may still be a large set, but it is the same<br/>\n&gt; problem faced by humans who develop a test set: &quot;When do you have enough<br/>\n&gt; tests?&quot; (Ooops, time for one more compsci buzzword: halting problem).<br/>\n&gt; So, on the question of what is 100%, it depends on scope to a degree.<br/>\n&gt; When do you stop testing your code, and begin testing the compiler, the<br/>\n&gt; runtime machine, the library, etc.?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Perhaps a more reasonable goal would be an automated test generator that<br/>\n&gt; would produce a test set that met or exceeded the tests produced by a<br/>\n&gt; reasonably good human. Essentially a &#39;best parctices&#39; goal.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I think I&#39;d be happy with something that produced any tests of real <br/>\nvalue, rather than routine ones I wouldn&#39;t write anyway. I just haven&#39;t <br/>\nseen a tool capable of that so far, and these days, my attention is <br/>\nfocused elsewhere, so I&#39;m no longer looking for them.<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJ. B.
