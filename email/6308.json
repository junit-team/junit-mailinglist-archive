The annual maintenance and support is<br/>\n&gt; targeted at companies who want/need more/faster support.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; With the &quot;basic maintenance and support&quot;, you still have access to the<br/>\n&gt; support forums,  and the  EAP (Early Access Program). It is still<br/>\n&gt; running, and has already produced 2 bugfixes releases, that work with<br/>\n&gt; the standard licenses.<br/>\n&gt; It should also give you access to next EAP (for the next version), that,<br/>\n&gt; I think, should start in about 2 months.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I was ignoring the &quot;special pricing&quot; because it expires at the end of the<br/>\nyear. So that&#39;s why I said $500 vs. the $400 you quoted. But let&#39;s assume<br/>\nthat we buy during the special pricing phase and that they always offer a<br/>\nspecial price when they release a new version and that they release one or<br/>\ntwo more versions in the 12-month period starting now.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSo if you were a new owner, you&#39;d pay $399 without the contract. If<br/>\nIntelliJ released one new version during the year, you&#39;d also pay a $199<br/>\nupgrade price, for a total of $598. If they released two versions during<br/>\nthe year, you&#39;d pay an extra $199, for a total of $797.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, if you got the contract, you&#39;d pay $599. If they released one<br/>\nversion during the year, you&#39;d still have paid $599. And if they released<br/>\ntwo versions during the year, you&#39;d still have paid $599 (a savings of<br/>\n$198).<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s similar for current onwers of version 2.6: upgrade without the<br/>\nsupport contract for $199, upgrade again for $199 ($398 total), perhaps<br/>\nupgrade again for $199 ($597 total). Upgrade with the support contract for<br/>\n$399 and don&#39;t pay extra if they release one or two versions during the<br/>\nyear.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSo the only way the non-support contract way is better is if IntelliJ<br/>\ndidn&#39;t release any new versions during the year. Or if they did but<br/>\ncharged less for them than they are charging for the 2.6 -&gt; 3.0 upgrade.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnless I&#39;m missing something (which I hope I am). (Though I wasn&#39;t<br/>\ncomplaining about the price; it&#39;s worth it to my company.)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nErik</div>",
