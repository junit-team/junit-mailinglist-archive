Having multiple assertion failures for a single test case would\nhelp with this. However, it would complicate the testing framework. As a\ntest writer, you have the option of dividing your tests finer to give you\nmore information. While some people go so far as to say that tests *should*\nhave one assertion each, I generally have one or two assertions per test,\nwith a fair number of tests with 4, 5, or 6 assertions (I wonder if this is\nfat tail distribution? I don&#39;t have enough data to be confident. Any\nmaster&#39;s students out there who need a thesis topic?)\n\nIn all the years I have done testing frameworks this way, I&#39;ve never missed\nseeing multiple failures from a single test case. Thinking back to my\ndebugging experience, I think that 90%+ of the time when an assertion fails,\na single change gets the whole test running. Can you tell me more about the\nsituation in which you wanted to see multiple assertion failures for a\nsinglde test?\n\nTake care,\n\nKent Beck\nThree Rivers Institute\n\n&gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; From: junit@yahoogroups.com [mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com] On \n&gt; Behalf Of Andrew McDonagh\n&gt; Sent: Monday, August 22, 2005 4:13 PM\n&gt; To: junit@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Subject: Re: [junit] Preventing JUnit from stopping on failures.\n&gt; \n&gt; raffadub wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;Assuming there is a test function with several assertions; if one\n&gt; &gt;failes the assertions past it are not executed. Is there a way to get\n&gt; &gt;around this issue?
