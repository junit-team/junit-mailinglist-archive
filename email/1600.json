Some people have done significant work. JXUnit \n<br>\nwent so far as forking, and Vladimir Bossicard is obviously getting \n<br>\nfrustrated (not that I blame him).<br>\n<br>\n1. Erich and I are doing this on really limited resources, and nobody\n<br>\nhas ever said, &quot;How can I help?&quot; except Erik Meade. Coming to\nus with <br>\nan offer to make some problem go away is much more likely to get a <br>\npositive response than, &quot;Here&#39;s some code. Integrate it.&quot;<br>\n<br>\n2. JUnit as a political gesture celebrates the ability of programmers\n<br>\nto test their own software. The code and tests must be held to a <br>\nhigher standard, to demonstrate the techniques necessary to uphold <br>\nour end of the bargain.<br>\n<br>\n3. We are new to the open source culture, and we are certain to make\n<br>\nsome mistakes. When we do, we need feedback.<br>\n<br>\n4. We don&#39;t get to program much, and when we do it is generally in a\n<br>\nvery constrainted situation where we have to make lots of <br>\ncompromises. Our greatest joy in JUnit is a project where we can <br>\nengineer at the limits of our ability.<br>\n<br>\nOur long-term goal is to shift primary responsibility for the further\n<br>\ndevelopment of JUnit to the community, while retaining the technical\n<br>\nexcellence exhibited by junit.framework, extending that level of <br>\nrefinement to the rest of the codebase, and maintaining our ability \n<br>\nto get together for a couple of days and add cool features.<br>\n<br>\nImmediately, expect any submissions that don&#39;t come with extensive <br>\ntest cases to be unceremoniously bounced. Offers of help with grunge\n<br>\nwork will be gratefully accepted.<br>\n<br>\nKent<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nTo unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:<br>\njunit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n<br>\nYour use of Yahoo!
