I have to disagree with that the moral of my story is\n&quot;the importance of the IDE.&quot;  Sure, the right tool can make a\njob easier, but it wasnt&#39; THAT difficult to type it in.  If I&#39;d\nbeen doing a lot of stuff like that, I&#39;d have taken the javadoc\nHTML and edited it with a more powerful editor (vi) than the\none I was using (Kawa 3.51a).  The job didn&#39;t seem big enough\nto make that context switch.  It was just a PITA.\n\nThe reason I&#39;m disagreeing is that I&#39;m currently fighting VisualCafe\ntrying to get it to deploy a simple EJB to WebLogic.  I&#39;m sure that\nVisualCafe has a lot of power, but it also is quite complicate and\nit hides what it&#39;s doing. (At least, it&#39;s not clear to me.)  Tools\nthat automate stuff for you are no substitute for knowing what&#39;s\ngoing on.\n\nThat said, maybe I&#39;ll look into NetBeans.  I wonder if it&#39;ll be\nfast enough to run on my lapton (a 233MHz K6)?\n\n - George\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: Steve Freeman [mailto:steve@...]\nSent: Friday, March 16, 2001 3:23 AM\nTo: junit@yahoogroups.com\nSubject: [junit] Re: awkward mock objects\n\n\nI guess it&#39;s about time to announce our mock objects library at \nhttp://sourceforge.net/projects/mockobjects/. We aren&#39;t quite ready, \nlargely because we haven&#39;t quite got the sourceforge infrastructure \nworking for us, but it&#39;s in the CVS repository. There&#39;s no doc, but \nthere are unit tests and a copy of our XP2000 paper.\n\nThe code includes our expectation library and mock implementations of \nthings like io, servlets, and jdbc. There&#39;s also a jar that provides \nsome fill-in classes so it can run in Java 1.1.x. Given it&#39;s raw \nstate, please be gentle with us ;-) \n\nInterestingly, one of the morals of this exercise is the importance \nof the IDE. Creating mock objects from an interface is actually quite \neasy if you&#39;ve got a tool, such as VisualAge or NetBeans, that will \nwrite the skeleton.\n\nSteve\n\n--- In junit@y..., &quot;Dinwiddie, George&quot; &lt;George.Dinwiddie@a...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Speaking of mock objects, I needed to test some objects that \ninitialized\n&gt; themselves from a JDBC ResultSet.  Rather than generate a test \ntable and\n&gt; stuff data into it, I decided to create a MockResultSet.  Well, \nResultSet is\n&gt; an interface with a LOT of methods.  What a boring chore this \nturned out to\n&gt; be.  In the end, I created an AbstractMockResultSet class that \nthrows an\n&gt; SQLException for every method.  If anyone needs such a thing, let \nme know\n&gt; and it could save you a lot of typing.\n\n\n\n\nTo unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\njunit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n \n\nYour use of Yahoo!
