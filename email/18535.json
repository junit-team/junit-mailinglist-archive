I wa<br/>\n&gt;  looking at www.mockobjects.com, and on the right side of the page it lists<br/>\n&gt;  &quot;implementations&quot;, and for Java it says jMock, EasyMock, and rMock.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  What does it mean by implementations? What standard or specification are<br/>\n&gt;  they implementing, if any?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  Or are they really very different things that only use the &quot;concept&quot; of mock<br/>\n&gt;  objects, but implement it very differently?<br/>\n<br/>\nEasyMock, jMock and rMock are not implementations of any standard or<br/>\nspecification. They&#39;re implementations of the mock object pattern<br/>\nwhere you define &quot;expectations&quot; (expected interaction, method calls in<br/>\nJava) for a smart test double, which can then afterwards verify<br/>\nwhether those expectations were met.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOn 12/13/06, lightbulb432 &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:veerukrishnan@...\">veerukrishnan@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;  Any advice for a beginner as to which of those three implementations to look<br/>\n&gt;  at (any difference in functionality, robustness, or any other criteria?).<br/>\n&gt;  Looking at their websites I couldn&#39;t really tell what the main differences<br/>\n&gt;  are.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve been personally using EasyMock for a long time. The reason for me<br/>\nhaving used EasyMock has really been just that I disliked the<br/>\nstring-based approach of jMock (which doesn&#39;t work with automated<br/>\nrefactoring tools too well, not to mention modern IDE&#39;s<br/>\nauto-completion features) and rMock has just recently appeared on the<br/>\nmarket.<br/>\n<br/>\nFunctionally all of the above frameworks are almost identical so if<br/>\nyou don&#39;t have any bias towards a specific library, I&#39;d recommend<br/>\ntrying each of them out by writing a small set of tests with each<br/>\nalternative. For jMock, however, be sure to use the 2.0 branch from<br/>\ntheir Subversion repository as the API will change completely. They&#39;re<br/>\ndumping the string-based expectation setting API in the upcoming 2.0<br/>\nrelease (which Nat Pryce promised would be out real soon...).<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nLasse </span></blockquote></div>",
