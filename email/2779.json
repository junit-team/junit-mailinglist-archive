This is much more tricky, but is possible and I&#39;ve<br/>\n&gt; played with the idea some. Most browsers have an (undocumented) mechanism<br/>\n&gt; whereby you can access their virtual machine without actually loading the<br/>\n&gt; browser.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>If you are using Internet Explorer on windows, you can create a COM<br/>\ninterface to an instance and tell it to load a web page. Sort of like<br/>\nremote-controlling explorer. You can put javascript in your HTML page<br/>\nthat can call java methods in your applet to run the tests. You can<br/>\nalso create a second applet that can call methods in the applet under<br/>\ntest because they all live in the same address space.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think you can use a command line option to tell Netscape which page<br/>\nto load. I know this feature is available on unix.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis way, it should be very similar to actually running the stuff manually.<br/>\nWhat I mean is that this will emulate the live environment as much as<br/>\npossible.  However, I am unsure of how to automate the GUI interaction part.<br/>\nThere are some tricky threading issues involved. I think JFCUnit addresses<br/>\nthese issues for swing -- but unfortunately I am using AWT so I cannot<br/>\nbe of much help at the moment.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nChester Kustarz 2<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.monkey.org/~chester\">http://www.monkey.org/~chester</a></div>",
