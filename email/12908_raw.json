I am trying to test a method from a class where\n&gt; I need to do lot of env specific (like logger, database connection\n&gt; etc) initialisations in it&#39;s constructor.\n&gt; \n&gt; I don&#39;t want to initialize all those (by creating the object, may be\n&gt; using &#39;new&#39;)for testing a small piece of code\n&gt; \n&gt; what is the best way to acheive it?\n\nYou want to test a class, but you don&#39;t want to do the work it takes to \ncreate an instance of that class. I&#39;d say you have a problem: no object, \nno test.\n\nI would like to suggest that you /don&#39;t/ need to do a lot of \nenvironment-specific initialization in the constructor of the class you \nwant to test, especially considering that you /believe/ that you should \nbe able to test the class without doing all that work. So that means \nthat the constructor(s) you have for that class, while they work, are \ninadequate. Perhaps you could add one more constructor that bypasses all \nthat stuff. Would that work?\n-- \nJ. B. (Joe) Rainsberger\nDiaspar Software Services\nhttp://www.diasparsoftware.com\nAuthor, JUnit Recipes: Practical Methods for Programmer Testing\n\n",
