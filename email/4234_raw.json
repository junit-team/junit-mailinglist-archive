Nor do I know if my initial \nassumptions on how to write these custom assertions will be correct the first \ntime around and applicable for future versions of test cases.\n\nWith regards to possible second steps (future refactorings)....\n\n&gt;If the custom assertions are used by many test cases, I&#39;ll typically use this\n&gt;approach:\n\n&gt;public class BaseTestCase extends TestCase {\n&gt;//...\n\n--- In junit@y...,  Vladimir Bossicard &lt;vladimir@b...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;Unlike the &quot;new TestCase&quot; option, you can :\n&gt;- have multiple assertEqual(Object, Object) methods\n&gt;- use several user-defined Assert classes in one TestCase object\n&gt;- easily share your assertions, users don&#39;t have to redefine one \n&gt;TestCase class to use your assertions (2 classes instead of one)\n\n...Which of these two ways would you consider, in the context of Extreme \nProgramming, to be the &quot;Simplest Thing Which Could Possibly Work&quot;?\n\nAt first glance it seems that making a new specialized TestCase (i.e.- \ninheritance) to contain the custom assertion methods would be the quickest way \nto add these on. Just push them up into a new base class.\n\nHowever, the specialized Assert class (i.e.-delegation) appears to be more \nflexible and easier to change in the future. It also seems to better communicate \nthe purpose of the new class.\n\nIn other words, if I went with the new TestCase extension route, I&#39;m not sure \nwhether I&#39;ll remember 6 months down the road that I created the new TestCase \nclass to hold the custom assertions. Where as making calls to an specialized \nAssert class route would likely to be more understandable.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on the matter of simplicity and readability vs. ease of \ninitial implementation with regards to these choices? I&#39;m trying to stick to the \nExtreme Programming way of doing things.\n\nThanks,\n\nAnthony\n\n\n\n\n",
