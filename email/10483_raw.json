Say that I\n&gt;  &gt; want to make sure all the tests are actually getting called.\n&gt;\n&gt;  Why wouldn&#39;t your tests be executed? Are you worried that you are\n&gt;  building test suites incorrectly or that the test runners are broken? \n&gt; Or\n&gt;  is it something else?\n&gt;\n\nThere are all sorts of reasons that things might not get executed. For \none thing, I am not using the TestRunner functionality. It is not, \nactually, a requirement when using junit.\n\nBut, also, if I am going to set up something that is going to run \nautomatically for some period of time, then I will carefully check to \nconfirm that it is doing exactly what I think it is doing, at least \nonce.\n\nIt seems easy enough to add a method in junit that takes an \nOutputStream and writes verbose output to that stream.\n\nThis is sort of on general principals. If you are writing a framework, \nthere needs to be a way to run the framework for maximum transparency, \nas well as a way to run them most efficiently.\n\n&gt;  &gt; I have implemented a trivial over-ride of assertTrue(message,\n&gt;  &gt; condition) that checks a flag and, if debugging, calls the super and\n&gt;  &gt; than logs &quot;PASS: &quot;+message.\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; But it seems that one should be able to call all the assert methods \n&gt; in\n&gt;  &gt; a verbose mode and get the output.\n&gt;\n&gt;  Nope. You&#39;re the first person I&#39;ve seen on this list who wanted this\n&gt;  feature.\n&gt;\n&gt;  &gt; Is there a reason this rather simple extension is not in the junit\n&gt;  &gt; classes?\n&gt;\n&gt;  Yep. No-one wanted it until now.\n&gt;  --\n&gt;  J. B. Rainsberger,\n&gt;\n\nThen I will write up something and submit it to the sourceforge team.\n\nthanx - ray\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\n",
