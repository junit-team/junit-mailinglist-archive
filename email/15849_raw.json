B. Rainsberger wrote:\n\n&gt; Actually, it needs to be said. There are plenty of so-called \n&gt; professionals out there that think nothing of telling their clients to \n&gt; add 1 GB RAM, because, after all, &quot;RAM is cheap.&quot; (That&#39;s true in many \n&gt; cases, but not all.) It&#39;s good to know you&#39;ve not one of those people. :)\n\nSpeaking as one of those professionals, in a desktop or server \nenvironment buying RAM is cheaper than almost any other alternative. \nMost especially it&#39;s cheaper than rewriting the code to use less memory.\n\nFrankly, I&#39;d fire a consultant who recommended continued hacking at $80 \nan hour to save a byte here or a byte there instead of spending a few \nbucks to upgrade the RAM. In 2006 anyone who&#39;s running a desktop or a \nserver with less than a gigabyte of RAM is being penny wise and very \npound foolish.\n\n-- \n﻿Elliotte Rusty Harold  elharo@...\nXML in a Nutshell 3rd Edition Just Published!\nhttp://www.cafeconleche.org/books/xian3/\nhttp://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0596007647/cafeaulaitA/ref=nosim\n\n",
