I&#39;ll try to be fair to your\npoints--this is not something that I feel is immensely important to\nget agreement on, but I&#39;m hoping to help those who haven&#39;t tried\nassertThat to get a feeling for it&#39;s power, perhaps just enough of a\nglimpse that they&#39;ll try it, and see how it goes.  (Any apostate\nassertThat users out there?  Tried it, hated it, gone back?)\n\nOn 11/30/06, Jeff Langr &lt;jeff@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; The main benefit of literate programming that I gather from reading\n&gt; earlier messages is that it makes the error messages easier to read.\n&gt; Given this example:\n&gt;     assert(that(n).greaterThan(2).and().that(n).lessThan(10))\n\nFirst, I don&#39;t believe that there&#39;s a framework currently in existence\nthat looks like that (am I wrong?)  Second, as I&#39;ve said elsewhere, I\nthink this is not a useful example.  I find that I end up with very\nfew tests that actually want to say\n\nassertTrue( 2 &lt; n && n &lt; 10, &quot;n should be inside the (2, 10) interval&quot;);\n\nwhether I&#39;m using assertThat or not.  Do you?\n\n&gt; it seems to me to be at the expense of the readability of the tests\n&gt; (in some cases), and also likely at the expense of amount of effort\n&gt; required to code the tests.\n\nAs an aside, I find that\n\nassertThat(x, eq(5));\n\nrolls off the fingers just as nicely as\n\nassertEquals(5, x);\n\n&gt; For me, the answer is that my tests don&#39;t fail often enough to warrant\n&gt; that extra expense. Since I&#39;m doing TDD, assertions generally fail\n&gt; once, maybe a few times, during development. And while I&#39;m developing,\n&gt; I&#39;m pretty familiar with what the test failures mean. But after that,\n&gt; failing tests are pretty rare, and I want them to be. So, I don&#39;t\n&gt; usually bother with assertion failure messages.\n\nOut of true curiosity, to what extent is this because you&#39;re already\nusing the built-in assertion failure sugar in assertEquals?\n\nFrom experience, I find that:\n\n1) I like using JUnit for my long-running user tests, too, in which\ncase having enough information to debug in the first error message is\nindeed useful.\n2) Just as I find that the pressure to make my classes testable\nresults in designs that appeal to me, regardless of testability, I\nfind that assertThat pressures me to create designs that have easily\nasserted-on values.  For example, where before I might have written:\n\nassertTrue(process.finished() && process.returnValue() == 0),\n\nI&#39;m more likely to write (partially _because_ of the clunkiness of the\nconstraint syntax):\n\nassertThat(process.status(), eq(Process.SUCCESSFUL_RETURN));\n\nNow, I&#39;ve found a new class, ProcessStatus, that proves useful in\nrendering progress bars and info logs.\n\nIn general, I hope that everyone has an internal list of things they\nhaven&#39;t tried yet, aren&#39;t sure about, but are hoping to try someday.\nAnd I&#39;m hoping to get assertThat on a few more of those lists.  That&#39;s\nmy only ulterior motive here.  :-)\n\n   David Saff\n\n",
