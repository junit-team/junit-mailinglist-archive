The smiley really doesn&#39;t change much.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt seems obvious to me that J.B. *very much* cares about good testing -<br/>\nand about your concerns, even if he disagrees; else he wouldn&#39;t discuss<br/>\nthe issues at such length with you. I also think that the whole xJunit<br/>\ncommunity has done very much for the better regarding unit testing - it<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t deserve such comments.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut perhaps I am overreacting because I strongly feel as part of the<br/>\ncommunity you attacked with above sentence. I also don&#39;t understand at<br/>\nall how it connects to J.B.&#39;s suggestion (which I think probably isn&#39;t<br/>\ntotally misguided). Would you like to elaborate?<br/>\n<br/>\nRegards, Ilja</div>",
