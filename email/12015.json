Then your tests<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; instantiate different class loaders and hands them in. I don&#39;t know<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; class loading that well, so could it work?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Unfortunately not - in general, the components don&#39;t control their<br/>\n&gt; loading.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Oh, so this isn&#39;t a case where something is loading these classes <br/>\nthrough reflection, but rather, they just happen to be loaded by <br/>\ndifferent class loaders. Understood.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">  &gt; Timothy is correct, this is a difficult problem, and the best<br/>\n&gt; way may in fact be to isolate the classes appropriately if possible.<br/>\n&gt; One of the things I was hoping to check was packaging errors, where a<br/>\n&gt; class that the client needs is only loaded from the client jars even<br/>\n&gt; though the server jars have them as well. I had hoped this was a<br/>\n&gt; common problem that others had solved (and might be in your book), but<br/>\n&gt; apparently not.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Well, you&#39;re the first person I&#39;ve heard in four years try to do this. <br/>\nMaybe now that all the &quot;easy stuff&quot; is written down, we&#39;re becoming more <br/>\ndaring. You&#39;re a pioneer! :)<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJ. B.
