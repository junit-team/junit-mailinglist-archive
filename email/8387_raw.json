T=\r\nhere is a tendency in OOP to pretend\n&gt;there is behavior where there is no b=\r\nehavior. I think that is a mistake.\n&gt;Some objects in the system are just ba=\r\ngs of data. I think public fields\n&gt;should do nicely there. Ward Cunningham =\r\nhas been experimenting with\n&gt;ignoring the prevaling paranoia against public=\r\n data. I haven&#39;t seen him\n&gt;write anything on it yet, but it&#39;s good to test =\r\nlong-standing &quot;rules&quot;.\n&gt;\n&gt;I agree with that when it is applied to &quot;data str=\r\nuctures,&quot; the naked\n&gt;objects you refer to, but not behavioral objects.  I d=\r\non&#39;t think you\n&gt;were applying it to the latter, I just wanted to be clear.\n=\r\n\nExactly. I&#39;m with you. Sometimes, it&#39;s just a bag of data. Maps would do.\n=\r\n\n&gt;&gt; One counterexample is an object with 20 fields. Perhaps 20 set methods\n=\r\n&gt;is clearer, at least in a language like Java with positional parameters.\n&gt;=\r\n(In Smalltalk it&#39;s exactly the same, so it doesn&#39;t matter.) Should an\n&gt;obje=\r\nct have 20 fields? Perhaps not, but some do. It is not clear that\n&gt;breaking=\r\n that 20-field objects into four 5-field objects is any better.\n&gt;\n&gt;A twist =\r\non that... If that object needs to have 20 fields (which I don&#39;t\n&gt;believe i=\r\nt does) you can group fields together into other objects such\n&gt;that this ob=\r\nject is a wrapper on 5 others, each with 4 fields.  The data\n&gt;is still in o=\r\nne place, but it&#39;s creation is much less cumbersome and you\n&gt;can create it =\r\nin a sane state.\n\nI don&#39;t know that this is better: now I have to build fiv=\r\ne or six objects, and not just one. I think the creation is *no less* cumbe=\r\nrsome in this case. That has been my observation.\n\nTake care.\n\n\nJ. B.
