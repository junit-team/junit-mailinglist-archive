If you have a large project to maintain,\n&gt; don&#39;t write tons of tests only to have your project in the same state as\n&gt; if it would have been if written from scratch with the tf principles in\n&gt; mind.  If you do so, I think you are &quot;blinded&quot; by your &quot;love&quot; for the\n&gt; test-first principles.\n&gt;\n\nTest-first principles don&#39;t espouse writing tons of tests in any case, blindly or\notherwise.  Rather, test-first principles recommend writing or changing code only\nwhen a test is failing.  So, I question how following TfD could be dangerous.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; But I never said that the test-first principles are bad for an already\n&gt; developed project.  You only have to keep your head cool and avoid the\n&gt; rush.  For me, generating tests is a symptom of this rush (&quot;let&#39;s\n&gt; quickly have 2,000 tests written for our project&quot;).  If 99% of your\n&gt; project is already working, why should you first start by writing tests\n&gt; for 100% of your code.  Concentrate your effort on the 1% that doesn&#39;t work.\n&gt;\n\nYes!  By all means, keep your head cool and avoid the rush.  Grow the tests as\nnecessarily.  That&#39;s one reason I asked in previous post what value there may be\nin having a complete set of automatically-generated tests.\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt; One principle of XProgramming is &quot;YAGNI&quot;: so don&#39;t write tests until you\n&gt; need them.  And keep in mind that the goal is not to write tons of\n&gt; tests, but to validate your code.\n&gt;\n\nAbsolutely!\n\nActually, the goal is to deliver high-quality software predictably and as quickly\nas possible.  Writing unnecessary tests will impede progress toward that goal.\n\nMike\n\n--\nMike Clark\nClarkware Consulting, Inc.\nhttp://www.clarkware.com\n720.851.2014\n\n\n\n",
