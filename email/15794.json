A <br/>\n&gt; Request<br/>\n&gt; &gt; might be &quot;Please run all tests in class ValidationTest&quot;, with the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; corresponding Plan being &quot;I will run methods foo, bar, baz, and foobar<br/>\n&gt; &gt; in class ValidationTest&quot;.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; How does this affect test ordering?

If so, this<br/>\n&gt; feels dangerous since it will enable programmers to write order<br/>\n&gt; dependent unit tests, which they should really be discouraged from doing.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Extenders can write Runners that might choose to run tests in a <br/>\nparticular order.  This can be useful for many reasons--for example, <br/>\nrunning fast tests first, or those most likely to fail, so that <br/>\ndevelopers can work quickly on failing tests.  The same capability <br/>\nexisted in JUnit &lt; 4.0: just google OrderedTestSuite.  As you point out, <br/>\nhowever, if a certain order is required in order to make a passing test <br/>\nfail, however, this is a good time to reconsider your testing strategy.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe built-in Runners have no notion of test ordering, so the basic <br/>\nbehavior of undefined test ordering will remain.<br/>\n<br/>\n    David Saff</div>",
