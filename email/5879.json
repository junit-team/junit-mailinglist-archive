The common<br/>\ntopics that appear when discussing the complexity of JUnit are Suites<br/>\nand Tests, where this is just a typical instantiation of the Composite<br/>\npattern.  The TestResult is a collecting parameter, and so on.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am one of those people who puts JUnit forward as an example to be<br/>\nfollowed, and am, so far, unswayed from that position.  My views are<br/>\nbased on the code for JUnit 3.7, but I can only imagine that it has<br/>\ngotten better, and not worse in the latest release.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs is usually the case when using patterns in code, to the non-initiated<br/>\nany such code may look very complex indeed, and the relationships<br/>\nbetween the different classes unfathomable.  The benefits for those who<br/>\ndo recognise the patterns, however, is great.<br/>\n<br/>\nManuel Amago.<br/>\nmailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mamago@...\">mamago@...</a></div>",
