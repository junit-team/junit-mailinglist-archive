I&#39;ve seen this problem discussed in this group \nbefore, but I think my problem is different:\n\nI&#39;m using a class in some places that extends TestCase and does some \ndatabase setup work. The JUnits that extend MyTestCase are the ones \nthat don&#39;t show up; the ones that extend it directly, do.\n\nI can only assume that I&#39;ve somehow incorrectly overriden TestCase, \nbut I&#39;m not sure how or what the fix would be...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
