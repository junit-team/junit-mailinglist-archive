Simple is not<br/>\nalways or even often &quot;easy&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut hey, if it was easy it would not be as much fun!<br/>\n/J<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On 9/12/07, hyysguyang &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:hyysguyang@...\">hyysguyang@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   &quot;C�(c)dric Beust ��&quot;&quot; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; True, but I&#39;ve also seen quite a few examples where TDD-written<br/>\n&gt; &gt; classes led to micro-design that forced a lot of refactoring to be<br/>\n&gt; &gt; made later as the complexity of the software grows. In particular,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the idea to &quot;do the simplest thing that can possibly work&quot; can be<br/>\n&gt; &gt; dangerous, because sometimes, you just know where your code is going<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and it&#39;s safe to start doing things that might not necessarily be the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; simplest thing at the moment but that will save you time in the near<br/>\n&gt; &gt; future.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; But sometimes I am confused with the idea to &quot;do the simplest thing<br/>\n&gt; that can possibly work&quot;. I lost my judgement on what is the simplest<br/>\n&gt; thing that can possibly work,just as mentioned in this discussion.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; How to get good judgement?I think I no choice but more and more<br/>\n&gt; learning and practice.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thanks.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n-------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nJoakim Ohlrogge<br/>\nAgical AB<br/>\nV�sterl�nggatan 79, 2 tr<br/>\n111 29 Stockholm, SWEDEN<br/>\n<br/>\nMobile: +46-708-754004<br/>\nBlog: johlrogge.wordpress.com<br/>\nE-mail: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:joakim.ohlrogge@...\">joakim.ohlrogge@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed] </span></blockquote></div>",
