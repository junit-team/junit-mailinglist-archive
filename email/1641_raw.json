(I&#39;m sure someone has.)\nWhat I\nwhat to=\r\n do is generate a report that shows some stats on how many\nclasses\nhave tes=\r\nt cases and how many methods in the class under test have\ncorresponding tes=\r\nt methods.  I have tried it a few different ways: \n\n1. Just scanning throug=\r\nh the source folder, picking up the java files\nand\nthen checking if a ?Test=\r\n.java file exists in a corresponding unit test\nfolder.  \n\nThis approach wor=\r\nks well if I only cared about the file coverage, but I\nnow\nwant info on the=\r\n method coverage.  Enter method 2.  \n\n2. Use a tool that will parse through=\r\n the java source and tell me all\nthe\nmethods. I used javadoc for this, but =\r\nthe problem with it is that I can\nonly\nsort through one source structure at=\r\n a time, and javadoc is not so nice\nto\ncall programmatically (it shuts down=\r\n your app after it runs once).  \n\nIf anyone has suggestions on a better was=\r\n to get info on the methods in\na\nclass, and other information like is the c=\r\nlass an interface, I would\nlove to\nhear it.  Or better yet, if anyone has s=\r\neen or built a tool similar to\nwhat\nI&#39;m doing I would also love to hear abo=\r\nut it.\n\nThanks,\n\nJohn\n\nTo unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\nju=\r\nnit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n \n\nYour use of Yahoo!
