Also, you might want to make that &quot;catch (Throwable t)&quot;\n\nI don&#39;t ag=\r\nree.  You should catch (&lt;exceptions declared in throw\nclause&gt;).\n\n&gt; On this =\r\npoint, does anybody here catches Throwables inside his code?\n\nI don&#39;t!\n\n&gt; I=\r\n do. Even if not *supposed* to. Because when I &quot;try&quot; \n&gt; something, I want n=\r\nothing to crap out except possibly that \n&gt; thing, and I want to know about =\r\nit.\n\nYou could log it, so that you know a given problem has occurred, then\n=\r\nyou could look at the resons that caused the error to fix the bug.  But\nyou=\r\n should then let the error filter up the chain to be handled by the\ncorrect=\r\n error handler, or even halt the JVM process if it comes to that.\n\n&gt; For ex=\r\nemple, if there is a classpath problem preventing me to \n&gt; do X(), I want t=\r\no catch the NoClassDefFoundError, log the \n&gt; error, and invoke my recovery =\r\nstrategy (msg to user, \n&gt; alternate method, etc..), Not let the error go al=\r\nl the way to \n&gt; the top and possibly stop some important top-level task (or=\r\n \n&gt; worse the entire jvm process).\n\nIn this example, I would not catch Thro=\r\nwable, then.  I would catch\nNoClassDefFoundError.\n\nThe only place where I /=\r\nmay/ catch Throwable explicitly, is at the very\ntop of the call stack (main=\r\n(), or some run() method), where I log the\nerror before gracefully shutting=\r\n down, or start some other recovery\nstrategy.  However, this should only be=\r\n done when a recovery strategy is\navailable.  What do you do in the case of=\r\n an OutOfMemoryError? (There\nare several solutions to this problem, but I w=\r\non&#39;t mention them here.)\n\nManuel Amago.\n\n\n",
