Well, most probably I was not clear. I&#39;m sorry \n    &gt; for that. I&#39;ll try\n    &gt; again:\n    &gt; \n    &gt; After testing the model, I like to do integration tests \n    &gt; for model, control\n    &gt; and view. I do this by checking the view. But as the view \n    &gt; is used by users\n    &gt; only, there is no need to know state, at least for \n    &gt; programm components other\n    &gt; than the tests. This approach is (Did I get you right \n    &gt; now?) not favorable in\n    &gt; your eyes? Which would be your favorable approach?\n\nIt isn&#39;t a question of being favorable or not.  It is a question of &quot;Do you\nwant to automate the testing of your GUI with JUnit?  And if so, to what\ngranularity?&quot;  I think testing the GUI is always good, but there are\nlimitations for JUnit to do this.  If there is pertinent state information\nthat you want to capture (which it doesn&#39;t sound like there is) you can use\nthe approach I mentioned before.  If you simply want to test the overall\nlook, a one-eyed inspection is fine.  If you want to programmatically test\nthe overall look, something like SilkTest would probably be a good way to\ngo.  I think that having state inspectors on every GUI component is\noverkill!  If there is some meta-state that your controller gets from the\nview to effect a change on your model, then write an inspector on your\ncontroller for that, but not just for testing.  The test should reflect (to\nsome degree) the usage.  Again, this isn&#39;t a silver bullet, it&#39;s just one\nexample.\n\nMVC can be difficult.  If it is done improperly it offers many traps!!  But\ndone rightly, it&#39;s a wonderful tool.  Testing is easier, refactoring is\neasier, etc.\n\n-Jason\n\n\n",
