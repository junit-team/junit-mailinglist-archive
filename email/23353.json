    "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-293267230\">Hi there,<br/>\n<br/>\ni have written a simple backup tool and 10 tests. They all have the same <br/>\nstructure:<br/>\n1. Create some test files and directories in an directory called &quot;source&quot;<br/>\n2. Start the backup process (to backup the files/dirs in &quot;source&quot; to a <br/>\ndirectory called &quot;target&quot;)<br/>\n3. Check whether all files in &quot;source&quot; exist also in &quot;target&quot;<br/>\n4. Remove all files from the &quot;source&quot; and &quot;target&quot; directory so that the <br/>\ndirectories are empty for the next test.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf i execute the whole test set ten times, i have 6-7 successes and 3-4 <br/>\nfailures. The error messages say that files in the target directory <br/>\ncould not be created or deleted (in the last step of the tests, see <br/>\nabove) if there is a failure. One possibility i could think of is that <br/>\nthe tests are not run sequentially, so they could have influence at each <br/>\nother. But as far as i know JUnit runs all tests in separate threads and <br/>\nthose sequentially. Is that correct? Does anybody have any suggestions?<br/>\n<br/>\nI use eclipse helios, JUnit 4.8.1, Java 1.6 and AspectJ<br/>\n<br/>\nBest regards,<br/>\n<br/>\nNils</div>",
