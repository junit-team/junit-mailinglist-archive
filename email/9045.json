In the face of the tools I currently use, I&#39;d<br/>\n&gt; probably think about alternatively deprecating it (in Eclipse, use of <br/>\n&gt; a deprecated method can be made very obvious, whereas I rather seldom <br/>\n&gt; take a look into javadoc).<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>That&#39;s my approach.
