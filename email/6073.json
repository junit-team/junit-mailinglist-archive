It is about a new tool with <br/>\nthe same name but different background. <br/>\n<br/>\nJUnitDoclet 1.0.1 ( <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.junitdoclet.org/\">http://www.junitdoclet.org/</a> ) does <br/>\ngenerate and maintain skeletons of TestCases and TestSuites <br/>\nbased on the structure of your application and some <br/>\ntemplates. Unlike some other tools it has build-in concepts<br/>\nto support refactoring. So it is very easy to keep the <br/>\ntests in sync whenever the application structure changes. <br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe the most significant effect of JUnitDoclet is to <br/>\nkeep the developer focused on the problem. There is no <br/>\ninterruption when trying to remember the syntax of a <br/>\nTestCase. ;-) With very few clicks / keystrokes the <br/>\nTestCase is there. If it is that easy, you&#39;ll find yourself <br/>\nwriting more tests very soon.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease visit <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.junitdoclet.org/\">http://www.junitdoclet.org/</a> to learn more <br/>\nabout this tool. There you&#39;ll find:<br/>\n<br/>\n * an online demo (See it in action before you install.),<br/>\n * FAQ,<br/>\n * user feedback,<br/>\n * the article &quot;Testing Without Excuses&quot;,<br/>\n * a download section and <br/>\n * much more (like the JUnitDoclet from Robert Watkins) <br/>\n<br/>\nThe downloads include examples how to integrate JUnitDoclet <br/>\nas external tool to IDEA and Eclipse as well as a more <br/>\ngeneric approach for other IDE&#39;s and editors. Of course <br/>\nthere is a readme for installing as ANT target too. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe believe JUnitDoclet does lower the step toward JUnit <br/>\nand relieves developers from routine work. At the same <br/>\ntime, the developer stays in control. While developing <br/>\nwe followed a very simple rule: <br/>\n<br/>\n  JUnitDoclet is standing at your side, not in your way.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you like that, please tell others about it.<br/>\n<br/>\nRegards,<br/>\n<br/>\nSteffen Gemkow</div>",
