I like the idea of generating useful documentation from\n=\r\ntest code.  I wrote a tool & test framework with similar goals for Python\nc=\r\nalled Protest (http://xspecs.sf.net/protest.html).\n\nOne interesting effect =\r\nI found when using Protest is that the generated\ndocumentation was enough o=\r\nf a different perspective on the test code that\njust skim-reading it gave r=\r\neally fast feedback on whether the tests acted as\na clear description of th=\r\ne tested code&#39;s behaviour.\n\n--Nat\n\nOn 11/11/2007, Daniel Brolund &lt;daniel.br=\r\nolund@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;   Hi all,\n&gt; I would really appreciate some feed=\r\nback on a small framework I&#39;m\n&gt; writing for JUnit 4.4.\n&gt;\n&gt; I call it Bumble=\r\nbee, and the purpose of it is to use comments and the\n&gt; structures in the t=\r\nest-suites/cases/methods to create &quot;human-readable&quot;\n&gt; documentation. It is =\r\nespecially well suited for writing snippet-heavy\n&gt; documentation.\n&gt;\n&gt; In sh=\r\nort, Bumblebee gets events from the execution of the tests\n&gt; (suites/classe=\r\ns/methods) and then parses the classes and methods for\n&gt; specific comments =\r\nto include.\n&gt;\n&gt; By default it adds the de-camelcased names of the suites/ca=\r\nses/methods\n&gt; as headings (a la agile dox), and the contained comments beco=\r\nmes the\n&gt; paragraphs.\n&gt;\n&gt; The comments are actually handled as Ruby-strings=\r\n that get executed in\n&gt; a Bumblebee execution context before being added to=\r\n the output. The\n&gt; execution context is\n&gt; a kind of DSL for including code-=\r\nsnippets and other things needed, and\n&gt; one of the core ideas of Bumblebee =\r\nis that you should be able to\n&gt; extend that functionality easily.\n&gt;\n&gt; More =\r\ndetailed information about Bumblebee can be found at:\n&gt;\n&gt; http://www.agical=\r\n.com/bumblebee/bumblebee_doc.html\n&gt;\n&gt; which is of course generated with Bum=\r\nblebee. :-)\n&gt;\n&gt; The concept of Bumblebee is the same as for TDDoc, which me=\r\n and Joakim\n&gt; Ohlrogge wrote some time ago as an add-on for RMock. Unfortun=\r\nately,\n&gt; TDDoc became a bit of a dead-end technically, and Joakim and I tho=\r\nught\n&gt; it would be a good idea to start fresh. I happened to have the time =\r\nat\n&gt; the time and I started it up. So, if you like Bumblebee, give half of\n=\r\n&gt; your credits to Joakim!\n&gt;\n&gt; This is an early release, and I will be very =\r\nhappy for any feedback I\n&gt; can get to improve it.\n&gt;\n&gt; Cheers\n&gt; Daniel Brolu=\r\nnd\n&gt;\n&gt; __________________________\n&gt; Daniel Brolund\n&gt;\n&gt; Agical AB\n&gt; V=E4ster=\r\nl=E5nggatan 79, 2 tr\n&gt; 111 29 Stockholm, SWEDEN\n&gt;\n&gt; web: www.agical.com\n&gt; m=\r\nob: +46-708-754002\n&gt; mail: daniel.brolund@... &lt;daniel.brolund%40agic=\r\nal.com&gt;\n&gt; blog: danielbrolund.wordpress.com\n&gt; priv: daniel.brolund@...=\r\nm &lt;daniel.brolund%40gmail.com&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message h=\r\nave been removed]\n\n\n",
