    "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1862450585\">JRequire is a requirement coverage tool that lets you focus on<br/>\nrequirements as you develop code. It lets you leverage from standard<br/>\ndevelopment practices to get more insight into the requirements <br/>\ncovered by the code. <br/>\n<br/>\nJRequire works on top of the well known unit testing framework - <br/>\nJUnit, to identify the requirement coverage in the code. This also <br/>\nmakes JRequire useful for projects, which use tools that operate on <br/>\ntop of JUnit, such as, Cactus, StrutsTestcase, etc. <br/>\n<br/>\nFollowing are the salient features of JRequire<br/>\n- Facilitates traceability of code to requirements during <br/>\ndevelopment.<br/>\n- Well-integrated with the standard JUnit unit testing framework. <br/>\n- Eclipse Plugin: Provides a convenient editor to manage requirements<br/>\n  and an instant view to developers on requirement coverage as they<br/>\n  develop code. <br/>\n- Custom ANT Task: This is useful for automated builds and generating<br/>\n  requirement coverage for the entire project. <br/>\n- Sophisticated reporting on covered requirements, broken <br/>\n  requirements and requirements with no coverage. <br/>\n- Round trip engineering: Keep your source/external requirements<br/>\n  files and JRequire requirements files in sync as your project<br/>\n  proceeds. <br/>\n- Refactoring: Keep your requirements files up-to-date when the unit<br/>\n  tests are refactored.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease visit the following link to download it<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.technobuff.net/webapp/product/showProduct.do?\">http://www.technobuff.net/webapp/product/showProduct.do?</a><br/>\nname=jrequire</div>",
