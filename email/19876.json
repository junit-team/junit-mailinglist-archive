Fool me once. :-)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I think your post is a good example of the importance of<br/>\n&gt; paying attention and asking questions. I certainly failed that<br/>\n&gt; test in this case! I remember a test I took in grade school:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 1. read all instructions before proceeding<br/>\n&gt; 2. write down the names of the planets<br/>\n&gt; 3. etc.<br/>\n&gt; ...<br/>\n&gt; 25. ignore all preceding steps<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I hadn&#39;t even noticed that a number of kids had put their pencil<br/>\n&gt; down in the first 20 seconds. Yeah, sure, read instructions.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The initial solution you provided presents more than a simple<br/>\n&gt; refactoring. It&#39;s a generalization, one that your requirement<br/>\n&gt; doesn&#39;t demand. I wouldn&#39;t have bothered with the refactoring<br/>\n&gt; in that case--the unnecessary logic introduces unnecessary risk<br/>\n&gt; (which is particularly higher given the absence of more<br/>\n&gt; comprehensive tests).<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I agree with you ,In fact I hadn&#39;t noticed it&#39;s a generalization .<br/>\n&quot;unnecessary logic introduces unnecessary risk (which is <br/>\nparticularly higher given the absence of more comprehensive tests)&quot;<br/>\nit&#39;s great ,This is fact indeed.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know the principle &#39;Do the simplest work&#39; but I don&#39;t have a lot <br/>\nof experience and lack of judgment on the principle.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow with your help I noticed my mistake is that I did the <br/>\nunnecessary work.This should be avoided in TDD practice.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIn addtion,I am very sorry for my confused word and fool <br/>\nereryone,This isn&#39;t what I want.<br/>\n<br/>\nEspecially, Jeff ,I&#39;m very sorry for fool you. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m very glad for your help,It&#39;s my pleasure ,thank everyone.<br/>\n<br/>\nBest Regards</div>",
