I&#39;m still looking into various<br/>\n&gt; possibilities of approaching the problem:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Problem:<br/>\n&gt; &quot;This is a 5 year old system (or better,&quot;evolved over 5 years&quot;),<br/>\n&gt; into production and has been working satisfactorily. (written using<br/>\n&gt; Java, EJB, JMS, Sybase and is pretty huge one). So far there is no<br/>\n&gt; automated testing employed to test this system. Now that I have<br/>\n&gt; recently been into this team, I&#39;ll have to come up with some way of<br/>\n&gt; automating the testing process.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m looking at various possibilities. Are there any general<br/>\n&gt; principles to make old code, Unit test compliant?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yes, there are. Michael Feathers has done considerable work in this <br/>\narea, but I don&#39;t know the publishing status of his &quot;Working Effectively <br/>\nwith Legacy Code&quot;. The things I have been recommending so far are <br/>\ntechniques he writes about. My book, &quot;JUnit Recipes&quot; includes various <br/>\nrecipes for testing legacy J2EE components.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I recommended in my previous response is the kind of thing that <br/>\nyou&#39;ll find in either book.<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJ.
