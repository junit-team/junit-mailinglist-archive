For &#39;public&#39; and &#39;protected&#39; methods, I&#39;ll attempt first to make the method cohesive and give it a signature that&#39;s as expressive as possible .  If the signature still isn&#39;t completely obvious as to the intent of the method, or there&#39;s something particularly interesting about the method behavior, then I&#39;ll add JavaDoc.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; I sort of agree with the idea that that tests can be used to document\n&gt; methods but have these problems with that:\n&gt; 1. Tests do not explain the methods, merely give examples of use.\n\nExamples constitute explanation to some degree, IMO.  In cases where the method does something particularly interesting, as mentioned above, I&#39;ll try to add a test to explain the behavior in addition to adding JavaDoc.\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt; 2. Tests do show intention of the method, just the implementation (we&#39;re\n&gt; back to the &quot;the implementation is not the design argument&quot;).\n&gt;\n\nRather, they show the intention, and _not_  the implementation.\n\nIs that what you meant to say?\n\nMike\n\n--\nMike Clark\nClarkware Consulting, Inc.\nhttp://www.clarkware.com\n720.851.2014\n\n\n\n",
