I guess I&#39;m in a wrong notion that I should test \nthe whole thing in a one single go. Now, I realize that I can test \nthe client and the server individually. \n\nNow, the big question is how do I test them independently?\n\n1. Client: I&#39;m not sure if I can use Mock Objects to simulate the \nresults from the server. Can someone please let me know if that \nwould work?\n\n2. Server: The same way in which I was testing the server from the \nclient. It&#39;s just that I&#39;m shifting the test code to the server now. \nAm I heading in the right direction?\n\nThanks for you reply again.\n\nRegards,\nKalyan.\n\n&gt; &gt; Thanks for your reply. I&#39;m testing the following things:\n&gt; &gt; 1. How the client collects the parameters that need to be sent \nthe\n&gt; &gt; server\n&gt; \n&gt; Let me try saying this differently, as a question.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Does the client send the correct parameters to the server, based \non \n&gt; user input?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Is that translation correct?\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; 2. How the server responds to the request.\n&gt; \n&gt; Again.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Does the server correctly process the request? Does it respond as \n&gt; expected to each different kind of request?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Is that translation correct?\n&gt; \n&gt; If both are correct, then we should be able to test both without \n&gt; worrying about asynchrony.\n\n\n\n\n",
