It is possi=\r\nble to have 100% line \n&gt;coverage and still have a defect because you have n=\r\not written code \n&gt;to handle a particular case.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; I do not like test co=\r\nverage measurement. It is not smart enough. \n&gt;Obviously, 90% coverage is mu=\r\nch better than 50% coverage, but the \n&gt;return on investment goes down consi=\r\nderably up over 90%. My opinion.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Take care.\n&gt;\n&gt;I have no real practi=\r\ncal interest in this. It is theoretical \n&gt;curiosity.\n&gt;\n&gt;You are right with =\r\nthe 100% objection. I meant a measure which \n&gt;covers everything. If all tes=\r\nts are written to the results of that \n&gt;measure and the tests are all green=\r\n then I think it is proven that \n&gt;there are no bugs in the code (if the tes=\r\nt has no bugs itself).\n\nIf you measure X then you get X, no matter what X i=\r\ns. If you measure lines of code, you get more code. If you measure branch c=\r\noverage, you get tests that cover more branches, whether those branches are=\r\n actually useful is immaterial. That&#39;s why I only like one message: Feature=\r\ns the Customer Likes that Work.\n\n&gt;Thats what I am looking for. The super du=\r\nper measure.\n&gt;\n&gt;Any idea?\n\nNo, because Test-Driven Development guarantees s=\r\nufficiently high coverage, so I haven&#39;t found measuring test coverage to be=\r\n useful. That&#39;s just personal taste.\n\nTake care.\n\n\nJ. B.
