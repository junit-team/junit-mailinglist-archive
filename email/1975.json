I&#39;m quite new to JUnit and Java but have used the C++<br/>\nequivalent for some time.<br/>\nI&#39;m using JDK 1.3.1 for Linux.<br/>\nThe junit package is downloaded and installed it on my local filesystem.<br/>\nTwo things:<br/>\n1) The junit documentation tells you to include junit.jar in<br/>\nCLASSPATH, but apparently javac for 1.3.1 is indifferent to CLASSPATH<br/>\nand I could only make it work by specifying &quot;javac -classpath<br/>\n~/blabla/junit.jar&quot;.<br/>\n2)The junit.jar file is apparently compiled especially for JDK 1.2.2 -<br/>\nalas I could not compile with javac. I found out that &quot;oldjavac&quot; and<br/>\n&quot;oldjava&quot; did work and so I&#39;m using them instead but this seems like a<br/>\nwrong way to solve things.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think all these problems could be solved with a junit.jar that is<br/>\ncompiled for 1.3.1 but haven&#39;t been able to find one. Is anyone aware<br/>\nof a place where one can download this?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks<br/>\n/Tim</div>",
