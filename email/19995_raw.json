But the building operation is under teh control o=\r\nf another team. So i jut want to test it locally on my local projects.\n\nI t=\r\nhink the best way is to use ant task. Is there more sample pages on the int=\r\nernet i can inspect. The reason of my question was : I am unfamiliar with a=\r\nnt. But I think it is the right time to learn it.\n\nI have also said that we=\r\n are using SOA architecture. So it makes unit testing harder for me. Becaus=\r\ne i was unable to get the coverage with emma. Years years ago an underlying=\r\n architecture was build and we are still using it.\n\nAs an example: We have =\r\nmethod like listBankElemnts() and is registred as BANK_LIST_ELEMENTS servic=\r\ne.\n\nSo the underlying mechanism calls listBankElements method when ve call =\r\nBANK_LIST_ELEMENTS with a refernce call mechanism. So emma can not cover li=\r\nstBankElemnts method. And this causes a very very low coverage. Is there a =\r\npossibility that we can also not get the list of metods within our html rep=\r\nort that were called by the SOA service names?\n\nYours.\n\n\n \n=A9brahim DEM=A9=\r\nR\njdbc_tr group moderator\nhttp://ibrahimdemir.wordpress.com\n\n______________=\r\n____________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nTired of spam?
