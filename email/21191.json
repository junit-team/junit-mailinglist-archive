I guess I&#39;m after a<br/>\nbetter definition of the problems that you&#39;re trying to solve that<br/>\nhave bitten you with the existing infrastructure (other than<br/>\nSourceForge availability issues in the past!).<br/>\n<br/>\nYou could just take a best-of-breed approach and pick &#39;n mix various<br/>\nthings. e.g. if you&#39;re talking about the Google Code code review<br/>\ntools, I would imagine that they&#39;re similar to this:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://codereview.appspot.com/\">http://codereview.appspot.com/</a><br/>\n<br/>\nSo far, I&#39;ve found that I like JIRA the best for bug tracking. I think<br/>\nyou could use codehaus for that. There might be other options too.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen I&#39;d definitely go for a DVCS such as git, mercurial or bzr.<br/>\nDriving down the cost of branching is very liberating in terms of<br/>\ndoing short spikes to try out ideas, but it can be a personal thing<br/>\nbased on your own workflow. If you did choose Subversion, I think<br/>\nsomeone in the community could setup something on github to pull it<br/>\nfrom Subversion anyway - I know several projects such as JRuby use<br/>\nSubversion on codehaus, but there are lots of git repositories based<br/>\noff the Subversion copy, for people to try out ideas and share them<br/>\nwithout necessarily having commit access to Subversion.<br/>\n<br/>\nMercurial does have a plugin for Eclipse as well, so tool support is<br/>\ngetting there.<br/>\n<br/>\nYahoo Groups already has the mailing list, so the idea of using<br/>\nseparate providers already seems to be implicitly there, but I just<br/>\nwanted to draw it out a little.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers,<br/>\n<br/>\nJames<br/>\n<br/>\n2008/12/10 David Saff &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:david@...\">david@...</a>&gt;:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; I think we&#39;d be hard-pressed to find another hosting solution that feels as<br/>\n&gt; bulky as SourceForge. I also think it&#39;s easy to over-state JUnit&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; importance to a hosting provider: as far as I know, we&#39;ve never cracked the<br/>\n&gt; top 50 projects at SourceForge--we release rather infrequently, and many,<br/>\n&gt; many people get JUnit for free with Eclipse, maven, etc.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; David Saff<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; On Wed, Dec 10, 2008 at 12:59 PM, Joakim Ohlrogge &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:joakim.ohlrogge@...\">joakim.ohlrogge@...</a><br/>\n&gt;&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; I know sharesource <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.sharesource.org\">http://www.sharesource.org</a> hosts both mercurial and<br/>\n&gt;&gt; SVN, I&#39;m not sure whether the same source can be accessed in both ways<br/>\n&gt;&gt; or not. We are using mercurial at my company and it works well on both<br/>\n&gt;&gt; windox, linux and mac. What is mainly lacking is good ide support but<br/>\n&gt;&gt; I say that netbeans support mercurial natively now so maybe that is<br/>\n&gt;&gt; worth a try.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Sharesource does not seem to have any export restrictions but is<br/>\n&gt;&gt; lacking review features as far as I know. But it has this certain warm<br/>\n&gt;&gt; fuzzy family &quot;niceness&quot; to it and does not feel as big and bulky as<br/>\n&gt;&gt; sourceforge does. I felt had to mention sharesource because I like it,<br/>\n&gt;&gt; I also think that whatever is lacking in features would be looked into<br/>\n&gt;&gt; in order to accomodate such a well known project such as JUnit, but<br/>\n&gt;&gt; thats just how I reasoning if I was running sharesource :)<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; In my book a distributed vcs such as Git, mercurial or bazaar would be<br/>\n&gt;&gt; a big plus.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; /J<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; On Tue, Dec 9, 2008 at 8:24 PM, mark_p_thornton<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mark.p.thornton@...\">mark.p.thornton@...</a> &lt;mark.p.thornton%40ntlworld.com&gt;&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a> &lt;junit%40yahoogroups.com&gt;, &quot;Nat Pryce&quot;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &lt;nat.pryce@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; 2008/12/8 Shane Mingins &lt;shane.mingins@...&gt;:<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Have you considered git and github ... just as a thought?<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://github.com/\">http://github.com/</a><br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Not sure how that fits in the Java space or not.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; It&#39;s more of a problem for people working on Windows.
