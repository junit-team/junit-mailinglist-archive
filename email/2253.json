IMHO, the QA team should write tests<br/>\nthat prove the functionality is available to the user.  Since the<br/>\nuser accesses the application via the web pages, this would imply<br/>\nthat they would need to write tests that simulate the user&#39;s use<br/>\nof the web pages.  But I&#39;m not sure that these functional tests<br/>\nwould always test the implementation of the web pages, which is<br/>\nwhere the developers may need to supplement them with tests that<br/>\nunderstand the underlying implementation and poke at it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe main reason we would have the developers write these tests<br/>\nis because QA does not yet have the capabilities to write and<br/>\nperform these tests, which we can solve by increasing their<br/>\ncapabilities.  For now we have to cover this somehow.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn addition to QA not being able to perform these tests,<br/>\nthere&#39;s also an issue with trying to catch these errors as<br/>\nearly in the release cycle as possible.  The developers really<br/>\nshould be regularly running all the web tests.  If the tests<br/>\nare too time consuming to run as part of the pre-check in<br/>\nsuite, maybe we just run them a few times a day as part of a<br/>\nbackground build verify process.  If these errors make it to<br/>\na QA build, it takes more effort to fix them and then build<br/>\nand deploy new releases than it does to catch them sooner.  We<br/>\ncan work on making the release to QA easier and more a part of<br/>\nthe daily process, rather than a discrete step.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow does your process work in these areas?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">  &gt; An effective approach would be to use a design pattern called Front<br/>\n &gt; Controller:  &quot;Centralize view management (navigation, templating,<br/>\n &gt; security, etc.) for a Web application in a single object that handles<br/>\n &gt; incoming client requests .&quot;<br/>\n &gt;<br/>\n &gt; <br/>\n </span></blockquote>(<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://java.sun.com/j2ee/blueprints/design_patterns/front_controller/index.\">http://java.sun.com/j2ee/blueprints/design_patterns/front_controller/index.</a> <br/>\nhtml&#92;).<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">  &gt;<br/>\n &gt;<br/>\n &gt; With Front Controller you can gut all of your business logic out of<br/>\n &gt; your servlets and JSPs.  Your business logic would be contained in<br/>\n &gt; separate classes which can be unit tested.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yes, we use this pattern, along with other J2EE presentation<br/>\npatterns.  Even with Front Controllers, and View Helpers, and<br/>\nother things that drive code off of the pages, there is still<br/>\na layer, however thin, that rests on the surface area of the<br/>\napplication.  IMHO, we still need to verify that this layer<br/>\ncontains the correct contents and links, and perhaps even has<br/>\nthem displayed at the correct position in the correct font,<br/>\ncolor, etc.  Also, the underlying controllers and helpers<br/>\nhave a degree of dependency on things like the HTTP request<br/>\nand session, so it&#39;s not always simple to test them in<br/>\nisolation from the web context.  How do you deal with these<br/>\nissues?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for your comments,<br/>\n-Paul Hodgetts</div>",
