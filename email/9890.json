I <br/>\n&gt; would like to <br/>\n&gt; &gt; test successful downloading and launching of the apps from <br/>\n&gt; the server<br/>\n&gt; &gt; via WebStart, I guess I am looking for WebStartUnit...<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I think you are /writing/ WebStartUnit... although not necessarily.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Use me as a virtual pair. Describe how you would test this manually.<br/>\n&gt; -- <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>J.B.,<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I would ideally like is a means to specify from a unit test<br/>\nthe URL of a WebStart app. to launch, then get back some indication<br/>\nof whether it launched OK, or some error codes if something went wrong.<br/>\nCurrently we have to test this manually by clicking on each app&#39;s<br/>\nlink on the WebStart page and verifying the app. is downloaded<br/>\nand launched successfully.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve already written some HTTPUnit tests which test following the links<br/>\non our WebStart apps homepage, verifying they&#39;re valid and<br/>\nreturn JNLP files when clicked.  I&#39;d like to test more than this however<br/>\nas more than a few times we&#39;ve<br/>\nseen problems such as JAR signing problems, library version mismatches<br/>\netc.<br/>\nwhich have caused the WebStart launch to fail.  I&#39;m aware that this<br/>\nmay be more in the realm of integration testing than unit testing as<br/>\nsuch.<br/>\n<br/>\nAny more ideas would be appreciated,<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\nSean</div>",
