Two of these sections involve accessing a Web Server and a series <br/>\n&gt; of Web Services that may or may not be running when I am testing - each <br/>\n&gt; of these also access other resources that may not be running (data <br/>\n&gt; stream and a SQL database respectively).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I thought HttpUnit would work, but that seems more geared to testing web <br/>\n&gt; pages - not testing Java code that reads web pages. What I want to do is <br/>\n&gt; build up a set SOAP page that my calls will act upon, thus I can create <br/>\n&gt; good and bad SOAP returns and test them - even mangled SOAP headers and <br/>\n&gt; test that it does the right thing when this happens (and given <br/>\n&gt; communication capabilities in the places this software will be deployed <br/>\n&gt; this will happen quite often).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; As an example of testing the balanceCheck function I need to build up a <br/>\n&gt; XML file with a given balance result, let the code read it, then test <br/>\n&gt; that everything happened correctly.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Code snippet at the bottom of email.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Any ideas on how best to skin this cat?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>HtmlUnit provides support for URLs returning pages other than HtmlPages, <br/>\nso that might help.
