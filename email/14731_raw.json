As\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;ve stated earlier, I use a default of package private when I extract\n&gt; &gt; a new &quot;public&quot; class.\n&gt; \n&gt; package private isn&#39;t public. I wish there a good standard word for \n&gt; default access in Java, but there isn&#39;t. Still it definitely isn&#39;t \n&gt; public. Whatever word you use for that that, please don&#39;t call it \n&gt; public. You&#39;ll just confuse people.\n\nI&#39;ve consistently said that I extract classes out to package-private\nfirst, and I make them public iff there is a need for it outside of\nthat package (this will usually entail moving it to a new package as\nwell).\n\nYou&#39;re the one who keeps referring to the creation of new classes as\ncreating public classes, Elliotte.\n\nRobert.\n\n\n\n\n",
