Unfortunately, I cannot see how to do this with log4j since<br/>\nit is a class rather than an interface.<br/>\n<br/>\nAny help appreciated!<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks<br/>\n<br/>\nRakesh<br/>\n<br/>\nPS I am using the 1.3 alpha release version of log4j which has a bug -<br/>\nlogger creation always logs even when you turn logging off.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAmerican Express Investments and American Express Independent Financial Advisers are marketing names for American Express Financial Services Europe Limited, a separate corporation within the American Express group of companies.
