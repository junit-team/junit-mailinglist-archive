In starting back up,\nwe recently received a helpful mail that challenged us to think harder about\nour community responsiveness.  Even when we&#39;re at full productivity, there&#39;s\nnever been more active committers on JUnit than you could count on one hand,\nand usually (including now), that hand could be missing most of its fingers.\nWe want the feature requests to continue, and even to accelerate, but we are\nunlikely to implement feature requests at the speed that they are proposed.\nOur practice with JUnit has always been to grow it slowly, adding features\nonly when they are obviously widely useful. Therefore, we should make clear\nhow your favorite feature request or patch can be among the few that get\nimplemented, integrated, and released.\n\nFrom here on, you can assume that we will be pulling work from the github\nissues list at http://github.com/KentBeck/junit/issues.  We will generally\nbe pulling from the top of one of three stacks:\n\n1) All bugs, sorted by votes:\n   - http://github.com/KentBeck/junit/issues/labels/bug#sort=votes\n2) All issues, sorted by votes:\n  - http://github.com/KentBeck/junit/issues#sort=votes\n3) All issues, sorted by priority (where priority is set by the development\nteam)\n   - http://github.com/KentBeck/junit/issues#list\n\nIf your issue is at the top of one of those stacks, and you don&#39;t hear from\nus for a couple weeks, please bug us to find out what&#39;s going on.\n\nIf your issue is _not_ at the top of one of those stacks, and you really\nthink it should be, it&#39;s time for some politicking.  You can convince the\ndevelopment team that your issue is more important than our current top\npriority, or you can convince the community to vote up your issue.\n\nWe appreciate issues that are solved by already-written patches, but we will\nnot necessarily prioritize a low-vote issue with a patch over a highly-voted\nissue with no patch. Even if you submit a patch (with tests, naturally, and\nplease follow our coding conventions), we are unlikely to integrate it\nunchanged. We say this because we never have incorporated a patch unchanged\nin 12 years of development.\n\nThanks for your continued community support.  We love the programming, but\nyou help make it fun for us,\n\n  David\n\n",
