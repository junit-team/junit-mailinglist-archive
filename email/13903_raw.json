I could use\n&gt; some advice.\n&gt; \n&gt; Some background: I&#39;ve come into a project that has no\n&gt; test coverage and has some pretty aggregious code...\n&gt; meanwhile new features are being slowly added.  The\n&gt; thing feels like it&#39;s on the verge of imploding, and\n&gt; this is the calm before the storm.\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m going through the process right now of adding test\n&gt; cases, but as I write them I&#39;m constantly fighting the\n&gt; urge to fix stuff.  My question: is it better to write\n&gt; all the tests first, then go back to fixing what&#39;s\n&gt; broken, or to fix the bugs and &quot;smelly&quot; code as you go?\n\nLet me assume that I get to choose, meaning that no-one is exerting \npressure on me to do one or the other. In that case, I prefer to fix the \nbugs/smells as I go. Here&#39;s an example why:\n\nSuppose I have the same broken code in five places. It might not even be \nexactly the same code, but it&#39;s very similar. I&#39;ll use tests to help \nidentify the problem in one place, then fix it there. Later, I&#39;ll use \ntests to identify the same problem somewhere else, so I fix it there, \ntoo. Now I get a nagging feeling that the same problem is in multiple \nplaces. If I hunt them down and the code looks similar enough, I&#39;ll \nsprinkle the area with enough tests to be able to replace the broken \nduplicate code with a call to the new working code.\n\nIf I had just written all the tests first, I wouldn&#39;t have seen the \nshortcut of fixing the &quot;5 times&quot; problem only three times, where the \nthird time is &quot;once and for all&quot;.\n\nIn general, tidying up as you go, especially in code with a lot of \nduplication, takes longer to get going, but allows you to accelerate. \nBefore long you notice that code you thought you&#39;d have to fix can \nactually just be deleted! (That&#39;s the best way to fix code: remove it.)\n\nTHAT SAID, if someone is putting pressure on you to expose bugs, rather \nthan fix them, then I recommend just adding the tests and fixing things \nlater. You can /try/ to explain to the pressure-applier that the cost \nwill be roughly equal doing it either way, but let that person decide. \nThere&#39;s no point in contradicting that person and then making him look \nbad. :)\n-- \nJ.
