B. Rainsberger&#39;s suggestion of adding a test \n&gt; name to each set of parameters?  Would that address these concerns?\n\nIt helps in part. However it relies too much on programmer design for my \ncomfort. This could become very obscure and opaque very quickly.\n\n&gt; This certainly shouldn&#39;t be seen as a replacement of any \n&gt; non-parameterized JUnit 3 tests.  \n\nAnd yet I&#39;m afraid that&#39;s how it will be seen by many programmers. A lot \nof the JUnit test suites I see in practice, including some I&#39;ve written, \npush way too much into one method. I was just looking at one a couple of \ndays ago that had about two methods in the entire test suite, and these \ntwo methods tested everything. Adding specialized support for \nparameterized test cases like this will just make it easier and more \nconvenient for programmers to do the wrong thing. I&#39;m afraid this will \nbe just too tempting and be use far more often than it should be.\n\nOn the other hand, it might mean more tests get written since it&#39;s a lot \neasier to add a line to an array of parameters than a whole new method. \nthat would be a good thing. But it definitely leads away from *unit* \ntesting. I think we&#39;ll see more functional and integration tests with \nthis and fewer unit tests (not that the lines between them aren&#39;t fuzzy \nalready) I&#39;m not sure whether the advantages outweigh the disadvantages \nor not.\n\n-- \n﻿Elliotte Rusty Harold  elharo@...\nXML in a Nutshell 3rd Edition Just Published!\nhttp://www.cafeconleche.org/books/xian3/\nhttp://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0596007647/cafeaulaitA/ref=nosim\n\n",
