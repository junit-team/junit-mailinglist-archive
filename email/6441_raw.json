A TestCase is the embodiment of a *fixture*... a\n&gt; specific context in which tests are run.  As such it should contain\n&gt; only those tests (i.e. test methods) which run in the context of the\n&gt; fixture that the TestCase embodies.\n  [...]\n\nI entirely agree that TestCases are (despite the name) intended to\nrepresent fixtures, and that mindlessly creating one TestCase per\nclass under test is a Bad Thing.  Your example in a subsequent\npost of separate TestCases for a list implementation illustrates\nthe point quite nicely.\n\nHowever, I think there are cases in which it is sensible to have\none TestCase for one class.  For example, suppose we have a\nComparator which sorts Integers lexicographically according to\ntheir written-out forms in English.  The class has no internal\nstate; all instances are equivalent.\n\nIn such a case, it seems to me not unreasonable to have a series\nof methods, say, one to test that 8 &lt; 7, one to test that 2 &gt; 3,\nand so forth, all in the same TestCase.  I can&#39;t think of a set of\ntests of such a class which merit a separate fixture.\n\nWe might take the view that, when a TestCase is closely tied to a\nsingle class this way, the fixture under test consists simply of\nthe class itself (rather than an instance with some specific\nstate).  If there is nothing else in common among the test\nmethods, it is not unreasonable to leave them all in the same\nTestCase, rather than, say, putting each in its own TestCase.\n\n-- \nSteven Taschuk           | &quot;Renner was competent.  Renner was also a\nstaschuk@... |  smartass; but that was a good bargain.&quot;\n                         |  (_The Mote in God&#39;s Eye_, Niven & Pournelle)\n\n\n",
