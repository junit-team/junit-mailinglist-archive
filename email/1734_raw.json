The private \nfunctionality being tested perhaps belongs in another \nclass.  The privates become publics in the new class,\neliminating the issue of having to test privates.\n\nAnother possible downside of testing privates is that \nit can be a hindrance to refactoring.  The nice thing \nabout not testing private methods is that you are free\nto change the implementation of your class with \nimpunity.  When client test code uses privates, it makes \nrefactoring far more difficult.\n\nThat said, I do find myself testing privates sometimes.\nIn the course of incremental development, my goal is to\nget to a green bar within a very brief amount of time.\nAs such, I&#39;ve found sometimes the best way to accomplish \nthis with a large piece of functionality is to decompose \nit into pieces of the overall algorithm.  These become \nprivates (technically package or protected in Java), each \nof which gets tested individually.\n\nAnyway, regarding private methods in servlets: view \nservlets as the user interface code.  You really can&#39;t\ntest privates (what I call &quot;side effects&quot;) of servlets \neasily.  All you can effectively do is test expected \noutput (URLs & HTML) against input (key-value pairs) \nvia HTTPUnit or some other similar tool.\n\nIf you find yourself needing to test privates, then, it\nsuggests that the servlet code is doing too much.  My\nservlets are virtually empty: the service methods simply\ndelegate things off to some other model object.  The model\n(which represents application concerns at this level) has\nalready been built test-first.\n\n-Jeff\n\n\n&gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; From: Lindanger Trond Kjetil\n&gt; [mailto:trond-kjetil.lindanger@...]\n&gt; Sent: Friday, June 29, 2001 12:02 AM\n&gt; To: &#39;junit@yahoogroups.com&#39;\n&gt; Subject: RE: [junit] Testing Private Methods\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Isn&#39;t this the same as saying that you don&#39;t have to test\n&gt; units/ classes since if the user interface has been proven to behave\n&gt; correctly, \n&gt; then the units/ classes has been proven to be bug free.\n&gt; I think this is a spooky approach.\n&gt; By the way, has anybody an idea of how to test private \n&gt; methods in servlets?\n&gt; \n&gt; Trond Lindanger\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; From: rainsber@...

Don&#39;t test protected and package-protected methods.\n&gt; \n&gt; A quote from the XP discussion group.\n&gt; (http://208.48.218.9/group/extremeprogramming/message/13213)\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;I actually do think that it is cut and dried. Public members have a\n&gt; behavior that is expected of them by their clients. Tests can \n&gt; be used to\n&gt; define that behavior and demonstrate that a particular method \n&gt; exhibits it.\n&gt; Private methods are, by definition, implementation details. \n&gt; Their behavior\n&gt; can vary freely so long as the public methods don&#39;t break. \n&gt; Put another way:\n&gt; if every public method has been proven to behave correctly \n&gt; then the class\n&gt; has been proven to be bug free. Therefore, there is never a \n&gt; need to test\n&gt; the private members of a class.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; So can you avoid testing them? If so, then don&#39;t; if not, \n&gt; then you can&#39;t\n&gt; have it both ways: either the tests are in the class (to test private\n&gt; methods),\n&gt; in the package (to test protected/package methods) or you \n&gt; can&#39;t test those\n&gt; methods. There&#39;s no magic here...\n&gt; \n&gt; Good luck,\n&gt; \n&gt; J. B.

It \n&gt; seems like its\n&gt; not going to be possible to do it while separating the \n&gt; TestCase classes and\n&gt; the business object classes.\n&gt; \n&gt; One of the reasons I see a difficulty is that we are using \n&gt; VisualAge for\n&gt; Java and it would make it a deployment nightmare to include \n&gt; the code in the\n&gt; same packages or, worse yet, the same classes.  I know that there are\n&gt; options I could use outside of VA such as ANT to only build certain\n&gt; classes,\n&gt; but I doubt I could get the client to buy into that and I \n&gt; still don&#39;t think\n&gt; that solves the private method issue.\n&gt; \n&gt; Am I just missing something easy or what?\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt; Mike\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
