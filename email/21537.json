I&#39;ve been assigned to<br/>\na new project where I have a group of Junit test classes (around <br/>\n150). My aim is to setup a fully automated test environment <br/>\nstarting on the current project status. I was thinking of using <br/>\nAnt as the the first step, and then moving to some continuous<br/>\nintegration tool further down the line.<br/>\n<br/>\nI see two main outstanding problems:<br/>\n<br/>\n1) My test hierarchy is made up of a heterogeneous set of classes,<br/>\nsome of which are purely stand-alone classes (i.e. I have to <br/>\nmanually launch them), while some others are grouped into<br/>\ntest suites. <br/>\n<br/>\n2) Test case complexity is very wide, ranging from very simple <br/>\n(and fast) ones to more complicated ones than can take hours to<br/>\ncomplete.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I was wondering what is the best tradeoff between prioritizing<br/>\ntests at code level (i.e. with Test Suites) vs. at script level<br/>\n(i.e. by specifying the desired order in an Ant batchtest task).<br/>\n<br/>\nAny help on this issue will be greatly appreciated.<br/>\n<br/>\nBest regards<br/>\nEmmanuele Sordini</div>",
