Maybe you are interested in<br/>\n&gt; what he has to say in favor of Contract-Driven Development. I like<br/>\n&gt; the idea of Design by Contract. And I think that it could make<br/>\n&gt; traditional JUnit tests obsolete, since the test cases could<br/>\n&gt; automatically be generated from the Contracts. I think this is what<br/>\n&gt; Parasoft JTest already does.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t know why you insist that DBC and runtime assertion-based testing <br/>\nare mutually exclusive, considering they have so much in common.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut you&#39;re right, it&#39;s not worth reopening the discussion.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Don&#39;t misunderstand me.

Anyone satisfied with the results they <br/>\nare getting from what they&#39;re doing now is /obviously/ too closed-minded <br/>\nto look at every potential solution that comes along.<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJ.
