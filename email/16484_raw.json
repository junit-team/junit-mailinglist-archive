Then we have 2 \ncorre=\r\nsponding \n&gt; system-level &quot;AllTests&quot; classes that encompass all the package-=\r\n\n&gt; level &quot;AllTest&quot; classes. Is there an easy and reliabe way to keep \n&gt; the=\r\nse &quot;AllTest&quot; classes up to date? It&#39;s hard enough to get \neveryone \n&gt; to wr=\r\nite tests, but now they also have to remember to update the \n&gt; appropriate =\r\n&quot;AllTests&quot; classes any time they create a new test \nclass. \n&gt; I hoping ther=\r\ne&#39;s a pattern or JUnit extension or something that \nwill \n&gt; help with this.=\r\n Any advice would be greatly appreciated.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks!!!\n&gt; Greg Plummer\n&gt;\n\n=\r\nThanks to everyone who has offered help with this. I liked the JUnit-\naddon=\r\ns solution, but there&#39;s a lot of red tape to bring new things \ninto this or=\r\nganization, even open source, so I didn&#39;t want to fight \nthat battle. What =\r\nwe wound up doing was creating an ANT script to \neffectively do the same th=\r\ning that the JUnit-addons solution would \ndo, since ANT is already an accep=\r\nted tool here. Thanks again!!!\n\nGreg Plummer\n\n\n\n\n\n",
