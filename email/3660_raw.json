In my junit test\n&gt; method, I want to be able to select and close the button on\n&gt; jOptionPane after it has been displayed.\n&gt; I am not sure how to do this. I have done this on dialogs that I have\n&gt; created myself by looking up the button and using doClick(). Seems to\n&gt; work just fine.\n&gt; So, do I use the same approach on jOptionPane? I assume I would look\n&gt; up the identifier of the button in the source and refer to it in the\n&gt; test method? Or am I missing a more direct approach to the problem?\n&gt; In short, I am not sure how to test a jOption Pane using Junit.\n&gt; Am I on the right track?\n&gt; Thanks.\n&gt; lee\n\n\n\nSo what were the results of trying the help from the previous message?\n\n-- \n\n&quot;They that give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary safety\n  deserve neither liberty nor safety.&quot;\n                 - Benjamin Franklin\n\n\n",
