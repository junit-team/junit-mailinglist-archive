Eclipse (et <br/>\nal.) have allowed thousands of programmers who were never able to <br/>\neffectively refactor &quot;by hand&quot; to use those utilities to improve their <br/>\ncode.<br/>\n<br/>\nI doubt more than an elite few are able to properly analyze package and <br/>\nclass dependencies (with or without tools) and without fully <br/>\nintegrating the analysis, you&#39;d see very few make use of the <br/>\ninformation for tests.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think such a test suite organization is essential, because the <br/>\n(semi-old) adage &quot;make your tests run faster&quot; doesn&#39;t always work, and <br/>\neven the most rabid proponents of that adage admit to sometimes only <br/>\nrunning a subset of their test suite.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Jul 16, 2004, at 5:07 PM, Vlad Roubtsov wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; On any but the trivial projects the number of<br/>\n&gt; testcases quickly exceeds 100-200+. It usually takes a<br/>\n&gt; noticeable time to run them all. It is also less<br/>\n&gt; efficient to do so because it ignores the idea of<br/>\n&gt; levelization (from John Lakos&#39; underappreciated book<br/>\n&gt; &quot;Large Scale C++ Software Design&quot;). In incremental dev<br/>\n&gt; mode it would be more efficient to execute only the<br/>\n&gt; testcases that correspond to the product package(s)<br/>\n&gt; that&#39;s just changed (and the dependency closure<br/>\n&gt; thereof) AND execute them in increasing level numbers<br/>\n&gt; (reverse package dependency topological order).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; It has been my experience that individual developers<br/>\n&gt; on a team don&#39;t normally pay attention to the concept<br/>\n&gt; of levelization. In the framework I use I can control<br/>\n&gt; testcase ordering via a simple text file and I can<br/>\n&gt; group individual testcases into sub-suites that I can<br/>\n&gt; also include/order via the same text syntax. However,<br/>\n&gt; this is a very manual process and hard to instill as a<br/>\n&gt; team practice.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; A tool/framework that enforces test (sub)suite<br/>\n&gt; execution in increasing level numbers would seem like<br/>\n&gt; the next evolutionary step after naive TDD. Does<br/>\n&gt; anyone know of such a tool? The testcase-&gt;app package<br/>\n&gt; assignment could be done by simply placing testcases<br/>\n&gt; in the relevant package (common practice already<br/>\n&gt; anyway) or by something like Java 1.5 metadata<br/>\n&gt; tagging.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; There are tools to analyze existing package<br/>\n&gt; dependencies, but I am not aware of a test framework<br/>\n&gt; to actually relate that data to testcase execution<br/>\n&gt; ordering.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; References:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.braithwaite-lee.com/opinions/levelization.html\">http://www.braithwaite-lee.com/opinions/levelization.html</a><br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://javacentral.compuware.com/pasta/concepts/packageDesign.html\">http://javacentral.compuware.com/pasta/concepts/packageDesign.html</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thanks,<br/>\n&gt; Vlad.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; __________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; Do You Yahoo!?<br/>\n&gt; Tired of spam?
