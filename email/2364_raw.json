I attached the tail.exe to the previous post and that\ncaused some folks&#39; email and virus clients to skip a beat.  If anyone is\ninterested in the tail program (freeware) let me know and I will put it in\nthe files section of the group.  For those who don&#39;t know what tail is...\nThis is a windows port of the standard UNIX tail that allows you to monitor\nthe end of a file as it is being written.  It is useful for log files or\ndebug files.  You can also download it from\n&lt;http://www.rhazes.com/cgi-bin/Utilitiy_0.asp&gt;\n\n-Jason\n\n    &gt; -----Original Message-----\n    &gt; From: Jason Rogers [mailto:jason.rogers@...]\n    &gt; Sent: Wednesday, August 15, 2001 8:19 AM\n    &gt; To: &#39;junit@yahoogroups.com&#39;\n    &gt; Subject: RE: [junit] Recover from test hangs\n    &gt; \n    &gt; \n    &gt; Which JDK are you using?  You could also use the \n    &gt; -Xrunhprof option (I think\n    &gt; it is only available 1.2.x +).  Use the attached tail.exe \n    &gt; to tail the file.\n    &gt; See \n    &gt; &lt;http://java.sun.com/products/jdk/1.2/docs/guide/jvmpi/jvm\n    &gt; pi.html#hprof&gt;\n    &gt; for how to interpret -Xrunhprof, but basically you are looking for\n    &gt; ThreadStarts that don&#39;t have an associated ThreadEnd.  \n    &gt; This will tell you\n    &gt; where possible hangs are happening.\n    &gt; \n    &gt; -Jason\n    &gt; \n    &gt;     &gt; -----Original Message-----\n    &gt;     &gt; From: David Roussel [mailto:dir@...]\n    &gt;     &gt; Sent: Wednesday, August 15, 2001 5:08 AM\n    &gt;     &gt; To: junit@yahoogroups.com\n    &gt;     &gt; Subject: RE: [junit] Recover from test hangs\n    &gt;     &gt; \n    &gt;     &gt; \n    &gt;     &gt; Run your tests with the text test runner.  When \n    &gt; it&#39;s hung do a\n    &gt;     &gt; Ctrl-Break (on unix you have to send a signal, not sure \n    &gt;     &gt; which one).\n    &gt;     &gt; This causes the JVM to do a thread dump.  You can see a \n    &gt;     &gt; stack trace of\n    &gt;     &gt; each thread and hopefully find your deadlock.\n    &gt;     &gt; \n    &gt;     &gt; -----Original Message-----\n    &gt;     &gt; From: Thach Nguyen [mailto:thach@...]\n    &gt;     &gt; Sent: 14 August 2001 18:20\n    &gt;     &gt; To: junit@yahoogroups.com\n    &gt;     &gt; Subject: [junit] Recover from test hangs\n    &gt;     &gt; \n    &gt;     &gt; \n    &gt;     &gt; Hello,\n    &gt;     &gt; \n    &gt;     &gt; Could someone advice on how to perform recovery from test \n    &gt;     &gt; hangs.
