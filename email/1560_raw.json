I don&#39;t know how much timing uncertainly\nprofilers or JPDA would add to the mix, so a simpler approach as in the\narticle might be best for specific threaded execution issues. Speaking of\ntiming, those Recorder methods should really be synchronized. Also, I\nwouldn&#39;t want to depend on my (in)ability to type the correct method name in\nthe call to record(...) method since I would probably end up pasting it\nincorrectly more often than not, so automatically capturing the method name\nwould be very helpful. Finally, it&#39;s a good idea to be able to turn off\naccumulation of diagnostic information in production code in order to\nprevent unnecessary memory usage.\n\n\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\nMike Silverstein\t\t\tvoice:  (919) 858-8300 x29\nSilverMark, Inc.\t\t\tThe object testing company\n5511 Capital Center Drive\t\tmobile: (919) 669-5906\nSuite 510, Raleigh, NC 27606\t\ttoll free: (888) 588-0668\nhttp://www.silvermark.com\t\tmsilverstein@...\n\n&gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; From: Johannes O. Akinlaja [mailto:joa@...]\n&gt; Sent: Tuesday, June 19, 2001 9:29 AM\n&gt; To: junit@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Subject: Re: [junit] Does this have a bad smell\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Well, yes, however to me it looks much more like a pattern for assertion\n&gt; testing than like a pattern for unit testing. If I had to unit test\n&gt; something like the controler, I would rather write own mock\n&gt; implementations\n&gt; of greeter and sender to test the controler: By doing so I will have no\n&gt; testing code in my production code. Does that seem too much of an\n&gt; overhead,\n&gt; or for what other reason is Eric Allen&#39;s approach more promising?\n&gt;\n&gt; Toyin\n&gt;\n&gt; ----- Original Message -----\n&gt; From: &quot;Jason Rogers&quot; &lt;jason.rogers@...&gt;\n&gt; To: &lt;junit@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; Sent: Tuesday, June 19, 2001 3:20 PM\n&gt; Subject: RE: [junit] Does this have a bad smell\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;     &gt;     I am a regular reader of Eric Allen&#39;s series at IBM\n&gt; &gt;     &gt; devoloperWorks.\n&gt; &gt;     &gt; In his newest article\n&gt; &gt;     &gt; (http://www-106.ibm.com/developerworks/java/library/j-diag\n&gt; &gt;     &gt; 0612.html) he\n&gt; &gt;     &gt; intermingles test code with production code. In my\n&gt; &gt;     &gt; opinion, this has a bad\n&gt; &gt;     &gt; smell, but ... well, I am interested of your opinion as I\n&gt; &gt;     &gt; am not to sure if\n&gt; &gt;     &gt; I am right.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Actually, I thought it was a *neat* idea, if needed.  He points out to\n&gt; &gt; places where the need for this might be apparent, you decide on\n&gt; the need.\n&gt; &gt; Recorder is just a special case of a listener.  You don&#39;t have to\n&gt; implement\n&gt; &gt; it the way Eric did, I think his implementation is a case of\n&gt; DTSTTCPW for\n&gt; &gt; his article.  More than likely, if you wanted some kind of Recorder like\n&gt; &gt; this you would have an update method on the observed classes that would\n&gt; &gt; cause the observer(s) to update itself.  If you wanted to get specific\n&gt; &gt; information about the class that is updating (like the method name), you\n&gt; &gt; could use the second parameter of the update method from the Observer\n&gt; &gt; interface.  Or if you have need of that param for something else, use\n&gt; double\n&gt; &gt; dispatching to call back on the observable.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; In short, it&#39;s a bad smell if you don&#39;t need it (either through his\n&gt; &gt; implementation or through your own).\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; -Jason\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; &gt; junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Your use of Yahoo!
