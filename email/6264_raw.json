B. Rainsberger&quot; &lt;jbr@...&gt;\nwrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; You probably want something similar to\n&gt; CruiseControl. If you don&#39;t know\n&gt; about it, Google it, download it and try it. It&#39;s\n&gt; not quite what you\n&gt; want, but it can be used to build and test your\n&gt; product every &#39;n&#39;\n&gt; minutes, and only if there has been CVS activity in\n&gt; the meantime.\n\nActually I already use CruiseControl and you are\ncorrect it is not quite what I had in mind.\n\nThe scenario I am most interested in is a single\ndeveloper working on a small section of the code on\nhis/her own machine. They want to run tests regularly,\nduring development, but why should they run the whole\nsuite every time, when they are only changing a small\nsection. The time it takes to do a test run is one of\nthe major hurdles to getting developers to run the\ntests in the first place.\n\nThis &quot;test filtering&quot; could be acheived by writing\nTestSuite classes in JUnit - but I personally think\nthis is a little clumsy, static, error prone and takes\nextra development time we just don&#39;t have. We use the\nbatchtest task from Ant for our JUnit tests - but of\ncourse it runs all of our tests every time. What we\nreally need is an extension to the batchtest task that\ncan do more complex filtering - not just by class\nnames - to decide what tests to run. I think that one\nof the most useful filters would be to only run tests\nthat relate to code the developer has changed in the\nlast 10 minutes (or some other number). There are\nprobably other ones.\n\nOf course, when the developer is ready to check in\ntheir code, they turn off the filters and run the\nwhole suite.\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
