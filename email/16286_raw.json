Sad, but fairly common in \n&gt; my opinion.\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; It&#39;s already been done, but I&#39;ll repeat it:  Michael \n&gt; Feather&#39;s book=\r\n &quot;Testing legacy code&quot; contains some good \n&gt; advice for these kinds of situ=\r\nations\n\nI don&#39;t believe we have any evidence that Kamal has\never purchased =\r\nand read any of the testing related \nbooks already recommended to him in th=\r\ne past on this \nlist.
