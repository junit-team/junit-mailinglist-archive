I think it is reasonable to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; say the test fails if its setup fails.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; No, it&#39;s not the tests that are failing, it&#39;s the setUp.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I see setUp just as a programmatical way to remove duplication, not as a <br/>\nseparate entity.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Imagine you have 100 tests and 1 set up.  The setUp fails, and now<br/>\n&gt; JUnit is telling you you have &quot;101 FAILURES&quot;...  Very helpful!  <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>100 failures, and when I look at the stack trace it&#39;s immediately clear <br/>\nwhere the problem actually is.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; And QA  will freak out on you.  <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>No, they&#39;ll never see that -- I don&#39;t check in code with failing tests.<br/>\n(I also assume that QA isn&#39;t totally resistant to explanations.)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Compare this to &quot;1 FAILURE, 100 SKIPS&quot;.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Now, *that* is a much more acurate view of what really happened.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>As I said, setUp and test method are one in my view of a test results.<br/>\nBut that may be due to I&#39;m used to JUnit&#39;s way of handling this.<br/>\nSo, assuming I don&#39;t check in code with non-green tests, why is it <br/>\nimportant to distinguish between skipped and failed tests?<br/>\nDoesn&#39;t a skip turn the bar red?<br/>\n<br/>\nRobert</div>",
