As it stands now, looking for the<br/>\ntest for a particular method within my repository is<br/>\nfairly easy to do manually. ;)<br/>\n<br/>\n-Eric<br/>\n<br/>\n--- Jeremy Thornton &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jeremy@...\">jeremy@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nwrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Hate getting dragged into what seems to be an<br/>\n&gt; argument about personal style,<br/>\n&gt; but as everyone else seems to have had something to<br/>\n&gt; say I&#39;ll feel left out<br/>\n&gt; if I stay quiet ;-)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Does anyone structure their tests to make them more<br/>\n&gt; useful as documentation<br/>\n&gt; ? I would be a lot more convinced of the use of<br/>\n&gt; tests as a sole documentary<br/>\n&gt; agent if it were easy to use a tool to automatically<br/>\n&gt; jump to the appropriate<br/>\n&gt; test for a method from the source code.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Seems to me that tests tend to evolve quite quickly<br/>\n&gt; and (maybe it&#39;s just me)<br/>\n&gt; haphazardly. One of the reasons I think that JUnit<br/>\n&gt; is so useful is that it<br/>\n&gt; is very light-weight. If its usage was altered to<br/>\n&gt; structure it more, the<br/>\n&gt; same problems with syncing with the code would<br/>\n&gt; happen as with integrated<br/>\n&gt; (javadoc) comments. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Just my tuppence worth.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;  -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: \tMike Clark [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mike@...\">mike@...</a>] <br/>\n&gt; Sent:\t22 February 2002 15:26<br/>\n&gt; To:\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject:\tRe: [junit] Re: JavaDocs<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &quot;Heath, Joseph&quot; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Then I&#39;ll leave you with this final thought:  If<br/>\n&gt; we design<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; software by writing tests first, do the tests<br/>\n&gt; document the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; intention of the software, or its<br/>\n&gt; implementation?<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; But this assumes that our tests cover all<br/>\n&gt; possibilities of use, which can<br/>\n&gt; &gt; result in large test suites. I am not against this<br/>\n&gt; (in fact I prefer it),<br/>\n&gt; &gt; but often a few words of English (or whatever<br/>\n&gt; language you read) is<br/>\n&gt; &gt; preferrable (IMHO) to a large test suite.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I still have the test suite, however, for<br/>\n&gt; refactoring and code proof.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; If we don&#39;t write new code until we have a failing<br/>\n&gt; test, then the tests<br/>\n&gt; cover all the methods.  I agree that they may not<br/>\n&gt; test all possible<br/>\n&gt; parameters.  We&#39;ll maximize the testing investment<br/>\n&gt; by testing interesting<br/>\n&gt; boundary conditions and reasonable ranges for<br/>\n&gt; parameters.  Our code coverage<br/>\n&gt; will still be very high.  And yes, we&#39;ll amass test<br/>\n&gt; suites quickly as our<br/>\n&gt; tests become more comprehensive over time.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; If a few words of English is necessary over and<br/>\n&gt; above the method signature,<br/>\n&gt; then by all means add it to the documentation.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I would still say that that the tests document<br/>\n&gt; examples of the intention,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; rather than the intention itself. These examples<br/>\n&gt; may be a complete set or<br/>\n&gt; &gt; may not be, often just the critical subset.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Agreed.  Examples of intention and intention draw<br/>\n&gt; closer together the more<br/>\n&gt; we use test-first design.  Nevertheless, we&#39;re<br/>\n&gt; documenting intention rather<br/>\n&gt; than implementation.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Good points - thanks!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Mike<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --<br/>\n&gt; Mike Clark<br/>\n&gt; Clarkware Consulting, Inc.<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.clarkware.com\">http://www.clarkware.com</a><br/>\n&gt; 720.851.2014<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\">junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
