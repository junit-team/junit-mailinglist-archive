An end-to-end test is a test that tests the system from outside.\n &quot;Edge-to-edge&quot; might be a better term because most systems don&#39;t have\n&quot;front&quot; and &quot;back&quot; ends.\n\n&quot;End-to-end&quot; also applies to the development process.  I like my\nend-to-end test run to build the system from source into deployable\npackages and automatically deploy those into a production-like\nenvironment in the same way as a real production release.\n\n&gt;  2) I was thinking TDD is only used to develop functionality by writing\n&gt;  unit tests first and then the code, can it be more generic to apply\n&gt;  for functional testing ?\n\nIn TDD you drive all development with tests.  So, if you want the\nsystem to have a feature you first write a test that demonstrates that\nthe system doesn&#39;t have that feature.  You then work out which classes\nneed to be be added/modified and do those changes by repeatedly\nwriting unit-tests, implementing the code, refactoring, and deciding\nthe next change to make, until eventually the end-to-end test passes.\nYou then write another end-to-end test.\n\nEnd-to-end tests give you most feedback about the system&#39;s external\nquality.  Unit tests give you most feedback about the system&#39;s\ninternal quality.  They also allow you to maximise branch coverage by\nrunning fast (so you can exercise the code with many different input\nvalues) and letting you inject faults (by making mock objects throw\nexceptions that are hard to cause in a real system).\n\nIn my experience you need both.  System tests tell you when the system\nhas stopped working.  Unit tests narrow down precisely where the fault\nhas been introduced.\n\nAs the system gets larger, you may use subsystem tests that cover\ncoarse-grained components like servers, MDBs, etc. However, I have\nfound those only necessary in systems that were not originally written\nwith TDD.  In systems that were written from the start with TDD,\ncomponents are usually loosely coupled enough to let you run\nsubsystems in a unit-test fixture.\n\n&gt;  3) I need to understand more on this &#39;end-to-end&#39; testing, are there\n&gt;  any tools available ? or I should rely on the build process for\n&gt;  executing all the test cases for me?\n&gt;\n&gt;  Actually, I&#39;ve been started using unit-testing tools like Junit\n&gt;  recently for the newly added API in our product but rest of the code\n&gt;  is pretty much legacy in nature. So, i was wondering are there any\n&gt;  tools for doing this end-to-end testing ? just like Junit ?\n\nI use JUnit and a lot of helper code and support libraries to run\nend-to-end tests and have the automated build run all the tests, unit\ntests and end-to-end tests.  There are many tools for testing\napplications end to end, like GUI automation tools, but I&#39;ve not found\nthem to fit into a TDD process very well.\n\n--Nat\n\n",
