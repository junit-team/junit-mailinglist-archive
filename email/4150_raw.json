This setup \nalso has some good side-effects: In this way, you can write a class that \ncan scan the test source path and create a TestSuite that contains all \nthe test cases simply by matching the file names; it will always be easy \nto deliver binary without the testcases in it, if that is desired.\n\nSecond, I do find it a lot more pleasant to clicking through the html \nfiles rather than open up the source files to understand certain things. \n I do agree that making the code and document in sync. is a hassle, though.\n\nShane\n\n-- \nDisclaimer:  I join all the news groups out of my own interest.
