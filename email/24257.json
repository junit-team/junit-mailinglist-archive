It is simply a false dichotomy. It is not a<br/>\nmatter of &quot;we should be doing this rather than that&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn my experience Lambdas are a key to a great deal of simplicity. It&#39;s not<br/>\nreally a new feature in the sense &quot;we can do new stuff&quot; as it is &quot;we can do<br/>\nstuff differently&quot;. Looking at lambdas certainly doesn&#39;t prevent fixing<br/>\nother things. More than anything from this discussion, when looking at<br/>\nJUnit5 in the light of java 1.8, one of the things that should be solved in<br/>\n&quot;core&quot; is categories (it seems).<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",
