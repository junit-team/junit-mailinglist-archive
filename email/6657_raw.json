I have successfully used it when unit \n&gt; testing standalone applications. Suffice to say I am hooked ;-).\n&gt; \n&gt; However now my situation is a bit different. There is an application \n&gt; developed by a third party. I have to develop plugins for the same. I \n&gt; want to be able to unit test my plugins, and develop a test suite. \n&gt; \n&gt; The problem is however I can&#39;t execute my plugin as a stand-alone \n&gt; app. The code only gets executed in the context of the app that uses \n&gt; it. Hence I cant create unit tests that I can execute with Junit .I \n&gt; would be most grateful if someone could provide me with suggestions \n&gt; on how I could go about the same.\n\nCheck out www.mockobjects.com  The folks there developed some\nVisualAge for Java plugins using Mocks.\n\nAs JB explained in his reply, the idea is to find out what you are\nrelying on from the framework, and mock it.\n\nDave\n\n\n",
