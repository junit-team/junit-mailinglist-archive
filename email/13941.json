I&#39;m wondering what is the right way to set up <br/>\nsome random tests?  <br/>\n<br/>\nShould I just put into my tests a loop runs the test multiple times?  <br/>\nThis seems to imply that the test needs to call setUp() to get some <br/>\nfresh objects (&quot;test fixture&quot;) each time through the loop, which seems <br/>\nsomehow wrong (at least I&#39;ve seen no examples like this).  Is there <br/>\nsome better way to ask for a test to be run N times?<br/>\n<br/>\nI got turned on to JUnit from the book<br/>\n   Building Parsers with Java by Steven John Metsker<br/>\nhowever it seems that he does not use JUnit for random tests.  He has <br/>\na section extolling JUnit, but then a section immediately after about <br/>\nrandom testing that doesn&#39;t use JUnit at all.<br/>\n<br/>\nPerhaps random testing is not considered part of unit testing?  If so, <br/>\nwhy?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for the help.<br/>\n--Erik N</div>",
