It provides \n&gt; timings of the executed function and everything.\n\nThat just tells you how long it took to run.  It doesn&#39;t help with\nperformance tests.  For that you want to be able to create a test that\nasserts that a specific operation does not take longer than a\nparticular amount of time.  This is for cases where a certain level of\nperformance is a requirement.  By having a test for it you a) know\nwhen your optimization has been successfull and so avoid unnecessary\noptimization, and b) know when things slow down for some reason.\n\n&gt; Being new at JUnit, the timing tests are what alerted me to the fact\n&gt; that JUnit reloads stuff before each test (something I didn&#39;t know \n&gt; before I found the ANT task.)\n\nYes, that&#39;s critical to understand for a variety of reasons.  A new\ninstance of your TestCase is created for every test method that is\nrun, setup called, the test method called, and teardown called. \nThat&#39;s the key to keeping them isolated and independant.\n \nDave\n\n\n",
