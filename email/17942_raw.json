(It would not be considered a benefit - since=\r\n \nmigration is fundamentally a &quot;cost&quot; component.) \n\nAnother often overlooke=\r\nd cost component is &quot;legal&quot;.  It was \ninteresting to consult at one recent =\r\ncompany and note they  \nconsidered themselves indemnified for using JDK 1.3=\r\n by virtue of its \ndistribution with their licensed Application Server and =\r\nIDE \nenvironment.  In other words, you were not authorized to use a v. \n1.3=\r\n JDK other than the one distributed with the licensed IDE \ninstalled by the=\r\nir infrastructure support team on your desktop.\n\n(Note: The same was true f=\r\nor JUnit and Struts.  Since JUnit/Struts \nwas distributed by the licensed v=\r\nendor with the IDE it could be \nused.  No upgrades allowed!)\n\n*** End of Re=\r\nsponse ***  ... Opinions follow.\n\nWhile thinking more about JavaDoc annotat=\r\nions; it seems (to me) \nthere is a fundamental contextual difference betwee=\r\nn using an \nannotation as a &quot;marker&quot; (@deprecated with JDK or @excludeClass=\r\n with \nTestUtil) to be interpreted outside of method invocation and using a=\r\n \nJavaDoc annotation to alter runtime execution.  (This might be \nconsidere=\r\nd similar to the distinction between using an Interface as \na loosely-coupl=\r\ned marker [to overcome single-class inheritance] vs. \nan Interface to force=\r\n tight [fragile] coupling between artifacts.)\n\nSo - what I&#39;m having trouble=\r\n cost justifying is introducing a \nruntime influencing technology that simp=\r\nly is a stylistic \nprogramming change - from &quot;test&quot; to &quot;@Test&quot;.  There is n=\r\no value-add \nhere.  Right?  No additional value to customers and no additio=\r\nnal \nvalue to developers.  It is simply style.\n\nOr, am I fundamentally miss=\r\ning something.\n\n_Marvin\n\n--- In junit@yahoogroups.com, &quot;C=C3=A9dric Beust =\r\n=E2=99&quot; &quot; &lt;cbeust@...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Very fair points, Marvin.\n&gt; \n&gt; Quick que=\r\nstion for you:  does the existence of a tool that \nperforms this\n&gt; upgrade =\r\nautomatically (or for the most part) make this more \nacceptable to\n&gt; you?  =\r\n(I would suspect no since you were talking about the \nbusiness aspect,\n&gt; bu=\r\nt I thought I&#39;d ask...)\n&gt; \n&gt; -- \n&gt; Cedric\n&gt; http://testng.org\n&gt; \n\n\n\n\n\n",
