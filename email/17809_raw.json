B. Rainsberger wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt;  &gt; JDBC consists of a generic API, mostly interfaces, and vendors implement\n&gt;  &gt; those interfaces. The idea is that, at least in the broad strokes,\n&gt;  &gt; different JDBC drivers implement the same basic concepts the same way\n&gt;  &gt; (setting prepared statement parameters, getting connections, that kind\n&gt;  &gt; of thing... differences in SQL are another story altogether).\n&gt; \n&gt; JDBC is one of the rare cases where interfaces do make sense because\n&gt; there really are multiple independent implementations, and the same code\n&gt; may even need to work against more than one of them over time.\n&gt; Supporting this flexibility doesn&#39;t come without severe costs, but in\n&gt; the case of JDBC I think those costs are worth paying. This is really\n&gt; the classic example to demonstrate why we need interfaces.\n&gt; \n&gt; However, far too commonly people extrapolate from JDBC and similar\n&gt; examples to use cases where interfaces simply don&#39;t make sense. The vast\n&gt; majority of code and classes never needs more than a single\n&gt; implementation. The division of code into separate modules for interface\n&gt; and implementation is needless abstraction most of the time. The costs\n&gt; are high, and very little if any benefit is achieved.\n&gt; \n&gt; Interfaces are a special purpose solution for a few uncommon but\n&gt; important use cases. They are not the first thing you should pull out of\n&gt; your toolbox. They should not be the default way you design a class\n&gt; absent an obvious need.\n\nThis is one of those interested cases where we /each/ can say the following:\n\n&quot;Your argument is sound, and the theory is plausible, but my experience \nsays the opposite is true.&quot;\n\nIn your case, you have experience with over-designing with interfaces, \nso you tend to avoid them. In my case, I have experience with slow and \ncomplicated testing without interface, so I tend to use them.\n\nThe only statement you make that I wouldn&#39;t make is &quot;The costs are high, \nand very little if any benefit is achieved&quot;. I achieve considerable \nbenefit from interfaces, as my tests become smaller, simpler and faster, \nso I write more of them and run them more frequently. This gives me the \nfeedback I want to know my code works. That is the benefit I gain from \npushing the abstraction line further than it might strictly need to go.\n-- \nJ. B.
