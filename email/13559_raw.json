If\n&gt; all you test is public/protected methods, you will miss an\n&gt; opportunity to catch a bug in a very fundamental piece of\n&gt; your code and you will be wasting time looking for it.\n\nWhat this comes down to is that it&#39;s &quot;different strokes for\ndifferent folks&quot;. Some people hate testing private methods,\nothers don&#39;t mind it. Personally, I don&#39;t have a problem\ntesting package-level methods, but wouldn&#39;t jump through\nhoops to test truly-private methods. (Indeed, as I often\nhave classes with extensive interaction within the package,\nthis is pretty important)\n\nHowever, one very good piece of advice is: if you feel a\ndriving need to test a non-public method, it&#39;s a _possible_\nsign that you have a new class trying to emerge out of the\ncurrent one.\n \n&gt; For example, imagine you are writing a file manager that\n&gt; can list your files in several orders (by date, by name,\n&gt; etc...) and therefore, makes use of several types of\n&gt; algorithms, all private.  One day, the program starts\n&gt; showing the files in the wrong order.\n&gt; \n&gt; The sort algorithm is not exposed to anyone, but if you\n&gt; unit-test it, you will catch the error much earlier\n&gt; instead of starting to investigate, say, your list widget.\n\nHere&#39;s an excellent example. :) The sort algorithims are\nprobably a fairly generic sort of beast that could be made\ninto seperate classes without any loss of abstraction.\nIndeed, that&#39;s what the java.util.Comparator interface is\nfor. So you could then write tests for the comparators\ndirectly.\n\nAgain, however, this comes more down to personal preference\nthan any solid rule. The basics are: unit tests should try\nto be very fine grained. This may have the side effect of\nincreasing visibility of methods as you look closer at the\ndetails. \n\n&gt; Don&#39;t be dogmatic about testing:  test whatever you think\n&gt; can break.  And it&#39;s okay if it includes private methods.\n\n&quot;Wot &#39;e said&quot;.\n\nRobert.\n\n",
