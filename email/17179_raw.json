See the\nfollowing JUnit FAQ:\n\nhttp://junit.sourceforge.net/doc/faq/faq.htm#tests_11\n\nIf you are using Maven, just install it in your maven\nrepository, and then use as described in the FAQ &gt; How\nTo Article.\n\nIt&#39;s a good idea to read this article to understand a\nlittle about reflection.\n\nSometimes it&#39;s nice to be able to test private\nmethods.\nFor instance I have a maven mojo that loads a file,\nand then uses it as a model instance for creating a\nproject.\n\nThe file loading part is in a private method, because\nthe load routine is specific to the class that is\nbeing tested, and is therefore not useful in a utility\nlibrary.\n\nSo I just wanted to put the load routine in a private\nmethod and test it there, then call it from the public\nmethod.\n\n\n--- Ilja Preuss &lt;it@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt; &gt; I am struck where I have to test some private\n&gt; methods inside a class.\n&gt; &gt; Situation is like that, inside my class all\n&gt; methods are private except\n&gt; &gt; one through which we access the service.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I welcome any ideas in this regards.\n&gt; \n&gt; My standard approach is to move the methods I feel\n&gt; need direct testing \n&gt; into classes where they want to be public, and then\n&gt; test them as usual.\n&gt; \n&gt; What do those private methods do? Can you give an\n&gt; example?\n&gt; \n&gt; Cheers, Ilja\n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nTired of spam?  Yahoo!
