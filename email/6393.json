While other are fixing the library, your<br/>\n&gt; tests are still broken but it&#39;s still ok to commit new code (because no other<br/>\n&gt; new test fail)...<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I always thought the solution was that you maintained a list of tests NOT <br/>\nto run. This list may vary by platform (some tests don&#39;t work on platform X<br/>\nbecause it doesn&#39;t support threading, or whatever), and it may change over<br/>\ntime (as a bug in a library is discovered, then later fixed). The list itself<br/>\nis clear documentation. The only trick is getting junit to not run the tests<br/>\non the list... depends on how you run your tests. (Eg: a master suite class<br/>\nthat collects together all the tests, or an ant task that lists them...<br/>\nwhatever it is, enhance it to respect your SKIPPED_TESTS list.)<br/>\n<br/>\n-- Michael Chermside</div>",
