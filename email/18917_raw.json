What I mean:\n\nI&#39;m automating some tests on a legacy batch-mode app that runs\nremotely. This app runs headlessly, emitting tons &#39;o files to a\nfilespace, so basically I&#39;m automating\n\n* invoking the app (setting up its inputs)\n\n* waiting for it to finish\n\n* verifying the output\n\nFirst I wrote some classes to setup for and invoke the app. I know\nenough Ant to JAR this code up, so I wrote a build.xml (in eclipse)\nfor that, built the JAR, deployed it to one of the app&#39;s boxes (this\nis the kind of app that bogs down one&#39;s laptop if run locally), and\nran it with `java -jar ...`, so I know that works.\n\nThen I wrote a JUnit test that calls the code that calls the app, and\nrebuilt the JAR (from eclipse). Eclipse compiled the new JUnit-using\nclass OK, and included that class in the JAR it built, but the JAR\ndoes not contain junit.jar or any of its classes. So to deploy the\nnew JAR, I just unzipped junit.jar on top of my JAR&#39;s contents,\nchanged the Main-Class in its manifest, and re-JARed, deployed, and ran.\n\nThat worked, but ugly. How best to tell Ant to include make available\neither &lt;project name&gt;/lib/junit.jar or its contents in the output JAR?\n\n\n",
