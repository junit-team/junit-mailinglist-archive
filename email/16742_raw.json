B. Rainsberger,\n\nOn Friday, May 26, 2006, 8:57:09 PM, you wrote:\n\n&gt;&gt; kul991 wrote:\n&gt;&gt; Can i create stubs to simulate method calls to internal/external\n&gt;&gt; methods called from a method M1 while writing a test class to test the\n&gt;&gt; method M1?\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Stubs are created automatically in JTest but i wanted to know if there\n&gt;&gt; is a method to create stubs on our own using plain JUnit.\n\n&gt;&gt; JTest creates /test/ stubs, meaning placeholders for tests you might \n&gt;&gt; want to write. I find those stubs not to be very useful or helpful, but \n&gt;&gt; that&#39;s just one man&#39;s opinion.\n\n&gt;&gt; As for simulated method calls, you should look at JMock.\n\nAnother very nice library for that is EasyMock v2.2. I have been using\nit for 2 weeks now and did not encounter a single problem. It is worth\nconsidering.\n\n\n-- \nRegards,\nIvan Milosavljevic, BSc                  mailto:ivan.mile@...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
