But you can answer me without \nknowing the book.\n\nHe discusses testing private methods and has three solutions for \ndoing it: using &quot;public&quot; modifier, using reflection and using mock \nobjects to ease the problem of dealing with private methods or even \nto bypass it. (Page 153)\n\n1. The first two solutions I understand. But how can mock objects \nease or bypass the problem of testing private methods?\n\nNext he writes about branch coverage and cyclomatic complexity. He \nwrites that counting the branches is difficult if the message which \nis sent is polymorph. (Page 156)\n\n2. I understand this to this point. But then he writes that the \ncounting of branches is impossible if dynamic class loading is \nallowed. Why is it impossible then?\n\nAnother thing I don&#39;t understand is the a solution to the problem \nwith the Square class which extends the Rectangle class.\n\nThe problem arises if a method &quot;stretchX(int factor)&quot; is added to \nthe Rectangle class. Then you can override it in the Square class \n(so that Y is stretched too with the factor). But then a Square \ninstance cannot be used everywhere where a Rectangle instance is can \nbe used.\n\nHe has three solution for this: reversing the extends relationship, \nextracting a common super class and introducing a value semantics \n(&quot;Wertesemantik&quot;).\n\n3. How does a solution look like with value semantics? I&#39;m not sure \nif I translated the word correctly.\n\n\n",
