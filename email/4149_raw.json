Everyone I&#39;ve shown it to has wanted their own copy&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;T=\r\nhe book has several chapters on JUnit not to mention JUnit, HTTPUnit,\n&gt;Cact=\r\nus, Ant and more.\n&gt;\n&gt;For the complete review from Frank Carver go to:\n&gt;http=\r\n://www.javaranch.com/cgi-bin/ubb/ultimatebb.cgi?ubb=3Dget_top\n&gt;ic&f=3D49&t=\r\n=3D000\n&gt;191\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;If you have any comments on the book, there is a forum on =\r\nJavaRanch at:\n&gt;http://www.javaranch.com/cgi-bin/ubb/ultimatebb.cgi?ubb=3Dge=\r\nt_top\n&gt;ic&f=3D49&t=3D000\n&gt;191\n&gt;\n&gt;Please share you experiences with the book=\r\n or share you \n&gt;experiences with\n&gt;using the tools (JUnit, Ant, et al) to do=\r\n automated testing \n&gt;and continuous\n&gt;integration.\n&gt;\n&gt;A small comment about =\r\nthe review...\n&gt;\n&gt;I agree with Frank that the book is for more than just \n&gt;d=\r\nevelopers that are\n&gt;doing XP (XPers). I state this several times in the boo=\r\nk. \n&gt;However, I&#39;d like\n&gt;to add...\n&gt;\n&gt;If you are following the XP developmen=\r\nt process and you are doing J2EE\n&gt;development, then you especially need the=\r\n tools described in \n&gt;this book. This\n&gt;is because XP relies heavily on auto=\r\nmated testing, and continuous\n&gt;integration. JUnit, which is heavily covered=\r\n in this book, was \n&gt;designed and\n&gt;co-created by the father of the XP proce=\r\nss--Kent Beck.\n&gt;\n&gt;Here is what one J2EE XP developer wrote about the book..=\r\n.\n&gt;\n&gt;&quot;I have been struggling with turning XP methodology into a \n&gt;solid dev=\r\nelopment\n&gt;process. We&#39;ve had some success at my company but most times we&#39;v=\r\ne met\n&gt;frustrations primarily because we were trying to teach old tools new=\r\n\n&gt;tricks.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;&quot;Java Tools for XP has made a big difference for us. My team =\r\n\n&gt;has been able\n&gt;to use the tools described in this book to actually DO uni=\r\nt \n&gt;testing, and\n&gt;we&#39;ve already automated a significant portion of our test=\r\ning \n&gt;and deployment\n&gt;processes. Its also let us make a good case for open =\r\nsource tools at my\n&gt;company.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;&quot;Overall I definitely recommend this book =\r\nas the first book to make XP\n&gt;real.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;I receive a lot of email that state=\r\ns similar things. If you \n&gt;are doing XP and\n&gt;Java (especially J2EE), then t=\r\nhe tools described in this book \n&gt;are essential.\n&gt;\n&gt;Thanks again.\n&gt;\n&gt;Rick H=\r\nightower\n&gt;Director of Development\n&gt;eBlox, Inc.\n&gt;\n&gt;eBlox Tucson\n&gt;\n&gt;*********=\r\n**********************************\n&gt;* Check out my new book!:              =\r\n   *\n&gt;* Java Tools for Extreme Programming:     *\n&gt;* Mastering Open Source =\r\nTools,            *\n&gt;* including Ant, JUnit, and Cactus        *\n&gt;*********=\r\n**********************************\n&gt;\n&gt;http://www.rickhightower.com/JavaXPTo=\r\nolkit/\n&gt;\n&gt;Buy it at Amazon:\n&gt;\n&gt;http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/04712=\r\n0708X/rickhightower-20\n&gt;\n&gt;The book was written by members of the eBlox team=\r\n!\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;------------------------ Yahoo!
