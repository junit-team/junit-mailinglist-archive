There is one large difference in estimating models between programming with tests and programming without tests. When programming with tests it is generally faster to get to working code because the tests enable that, eliminating post-code debugging and fixing.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you are adding tests to existing code, then be aware that writing those tests will probably take longer than you expect, because the existing code is probably not designed to be easily tested. Moreover, the tests will uncover refactoring opportunity that will point to time wasted during initial development due to unnecessary duplication.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you go to your manager with effort estimates to add programmer tests to a project that does not have them, I wish you the best of luck. You may be shot.<br/>\n<br/>\nTake care.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;So said Selvakumar Ganesan on 2003-08-08 --------------------<br/>\n&gt;Hi,<br/>\n&gt;I am trying to estimate effort for writing a regression test suite based<br/>\n&gt;on Junit for an existing system. <br/>\n&gt;The method used for estimation is very simple (and possibly very wrong<br/>\n&gt;too) as described below. I greatly appreciate all inputs and thoughts on<br/>\n&gt;this. I googled and found no past or present precedent to estimating<br/>\n&gt;Junit test efforts based on Code complexity measures. I may have missed<br/>\n&gt;something important due to my ignorance and relative newness to Junit<br/>\n&gt;and estimation. I shall gladly stand corrected by more knowledgeable<br/>\n&gt;folks.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;---------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;*Hypotheses<br/>\n&gt;The working hypothesis for the effort estimation was &quot;a strong<br/>\n&gt;corelation between cyclomatic complexity of existing code and the effort<br/>\n&gt;to write junit tests for the code&quot;.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;As a consequence of this hypothesis it is further purported that &quot;the<br/>\n&gt;number of independent execution paths (Cyclomatic complexity) is equal<br/>\n&gt;to the number of test methods&quot;. This dictates some nasty terms to how<br/>\n&gt;the junit tests must be structured but it is believed to be a *resonable<br/>\n&gt;thing* for estimation purposes.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;*The estimation method<br/>\n&gt;Weighted Methods Per Class (WMPC) was used as a measure of complexity.<br/>\n&gt;WMPC is defined to be &quot;the sum of the complexity of all methods for a<br/>\n&gt;class, where each method is weighted by its cyclomatic complexity. The<br/>\n&gt;number of methods and the complexity of the methods involved is a<br/>\n&gt;predictor of how much time and effort is required to develop and<br/>\n&gt;maintain the class. Only methods specified in a class are included, that<br/>\n&gt;is, any methods inherited from a parent are excluded.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;The WMPC measured from the existing codebase was normalized for trivial<br/>\n&gt;methods like getter and setters. <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;The effort was estimated using a simple formula:<br/>\n&gt;Total Effort = Total number of test methods * Average effort for one<br/>\n&gt;test method<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;The Total number of test methods is calculated as follows:-<br/>\n&gt;Total test methods = Average WMPC of all classes * Number of classes<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;The Average effort for one test method (note that this is test method<br/>\n&gt;and not test case class) was estimated from actual efforts.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;*Sample calculation<br/>\n&gt;Number of Classes = 973<br/>\n&gt;Average WMPC ~= 9 (normalized for getter and setter methods. I used<br/>\n&gt;Together ControlCenter-&gt;Metrics for all these measures)<br/>\n&gt;Average effort per test method = 2 hours (It is upto the developer to<br/>\n&gt;distribute the test methods in a test case classes)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Total effort for writing Junit tests = (9 * 973) * 2 hrs = 17, 514 hours<br/>\n&gt;= 2189 Person Days. <br/>\n&gt;(*huh..hmm*. Let the beatings begin. I can&#39;t adequaltely express in<br/>\n&gt;words my manager&#39;s bewildered expression on seeing this number. But,<br/>\n&gt;that&#39;s another story.)<br/>\n&gt;---------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;If the general direction of the estimation is correct I would want to<br/>\n&gt;spend some time on refining the method to include all those important<br/>\n&gt;factors I am sure I have missed out above. Suggestions and pointers<br/>\n&gt;towards places I should look more closely to get a better grip is more<br/>\n&gt;than welcome.
