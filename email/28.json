    "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1639369088\">Hi,<br/>\n<br/>\nWe apply the following strategies to make our EJB&#39;s *fully* testable.<br/>\n<br/>\n1. EJB&#39;s are thin. They are really really thin. The EJB is in fact an<br/>\ninterface into a &quot;Box&quot;. Each Box owns some tables in the database. Each Box<br/>\nhas its private DB package (we do bean-managed), its own EJB (that acts ass<br/>\nan interface into the box), and one or more so-called Business Logic<br/>\npackages. These BL packages do all the work. The BL code is Unit Tested in a<br/>\nvery detailed way. The only thing the EJBs do is communicate with other<br/>\nEJB&#39;s and then call the BL code with the retrieved data.<br/>\n<br/>\n2. We also test the EJBs, but only very roughly. Every remote method is<br/>\ncalled, just to see that they work. The details are not tested here, because<br/>\nthey are covered in the BL Unit Tests.<br/>\n<br/>\n3. To be able to work quickly (hot deployment with underlying packages is<br/>\nnot really possible) we use bipolar EJB creators iso the regular EJB Home<br/>\nfor the session EJBs. That is a factory that returns the EJB in the normal<br/>\nway (created by the EJB Home) *or* as a simple local object, depending on a<br/>\nproperty that can be specified in a config file. While developing, we<br/>\nusually run the tests on the local session EJBs. Very nice for debugging<br/>\ntoo.<br/>\n<br/>\n4. Only when development of the EJB function is finished, we run the tests<br/>\non the remote EJB.<br/>\n<br/>\nbye,<br/>\nvp<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Vincent Massol [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:vmassol@...\">vmassol@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: donderdag 16 november 2000 22:23<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@egroups.com\">junit@egroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: [junit] Re: J2EEUnit<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hi Jonathan,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; With the current J22EUnit, it is already possible to unit test<br/>\n&gt; EJBs. In your<br/>\n&gt; testXXX() method just do a lookup on the home, create the bean<br/>\n&gt; and call it&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; remote methods. I am still wondering what I could add to make EJB testing<br/>\n&gt; attractive and useful :<br/>\n&gt; - I could first hide calling an EJB remote method by automatically setting<br/>\n&gt; JNDI, doing the lookup, create the bean instance and calling the remote<br/>\n&gt; method,<br/>\n&gt; - What could I do more ?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thanks and please feel free to contribute.<br/>\n&gt; Vincent<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>",
