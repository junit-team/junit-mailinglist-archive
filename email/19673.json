I think we forget sometimes that we use <br/>\nwhat&#39;s possible in a language and conveniently ignore what isn&#39;t <br/>\npossible. A great example in Java is the lack of something like C++&#39;s <br/>\nconst member functions. If Java had them, it would be great. But they <br/>\naren&#39;t there, and, in general, we don&#39;t feel any less diligent because <br/>\nwe can&#39;t use them. A more severe example is the way that protection is <br/>\nhandled in dynamic languages. In most of them, anyone at any time can <br/>\nsubvert something that is acting like a singleton. The convention is the <br/>\nprotection, not the language.<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess we could say that the measure of our effectiveness is how <br/>\ndiligent we are with what we have, and that we would be irresponsible if <br/>\nwe use anything less than all of the mechanisms that languages offer us <br/>\nto protect us from ourselves, but really I think we have more choices <br/>\nthan that.<br/>\n<br/>\nMichael Feathers<br/>\nwww.objectmentor.com</div>",
