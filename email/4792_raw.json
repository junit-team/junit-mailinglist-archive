So simply use both \nmethods in a test to be sure that you can read back what you have just \nsaved.  It will be very helpful if your database or object model changes.\n\nAnother solution can be to use Mock objects, but I personally think that \nit is overkilling for databases.\n\nIf your database tests take too long to execute, you can just execute \nthem each night, instead of every time.  Search for &quot;Continuous \nIntegration&quot; on Sourceforge.\n\n&gt; 2) &lt;b&gt; How can you verify the execution path that a\n&gt; program is taking unless its output returned is unique\n&gt; for that path? &lt;/b&gt;\n\nSo you mean that your program is unpredictable?  So when you do the same \nthing twice with your program, you have two different results... really \neasy to learn ;-)\n\nMore seriously, if you have a random program (let&#39;s say a roulette) it&#39;s \nalways possible to change the random mechanism so that the generation of \nnumbers is predictable (1, 2, 3, 4...).  Use Mock objects for that purpose.\n\nhth\n\n-Vladimir\n\n-- \nVladimir Bossicard\nwww.bossicard.com\n\n\n",
