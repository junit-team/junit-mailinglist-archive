The approach it takes is to run the tests from<br/>\n&gt; it&#39;s own servlet, so you&#39;re running the test in the container.  It makes for<br/>\n&gt; a good integration test (make sure it&#39;s deployed correctly, etc.).<br/>\n&gt; Deploying to run tests may slow things down a little.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Another option would be mock objects (http://www.mockobjects.com,<br/>\n&gt; http://www.easymock.org).  It has a lot of mock objects that will make your<br/>\n&gt; EJB think it&#39;s in a container.  I actually haven&#39;t tried them for EJBs, but<br/>\n&gt; it would be the first place I would go.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; If your EJB is simply a fa�ade, then I&#39;d concentrate more on testing the<br/>\n&gt; supporting business classes/methods, which it sounds like you&#39;re already<br/>\n&gt; doing.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Good luck,<br/>\n&gt; -Larry<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: skmajji [mailto:skmajji@...] <br/>\n&gt; Sent: Thursday, November 04, 2004 2:34 PM<br/>\n&gt; To: junit@yahoogroups.com<br/>\n&gt; Subject: [junit] EJB - JUnit Testing<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Hi,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Currently I am writing JUnit to test our business methods on EJBs.
