This causes the Object version of assert equals to be \ncalled, rather than the String version, and you will see the entire \nstrings in the failure message.  e.g.,\n\n    assertEquals((Object) &quot;I want to see the whole string&quot;, &quot;I did \nsee the whole string&quot;);\n\n\nI will sometimes do this when I can&#39;t figure out immediately why a \ntest is failing.  Other times, I like the &quot;...&quot; behavior.  \nInterestingly enough, the &quot;...&quot; behaviour is new to JUnit 3.8--I \nbelieve that Alex Chafee and others submitted it as a request.\n\nHope this helps.\n\nJeff Nielsen\n\n\n--- In junit@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Robert Huffman&quot; &lt;rhuffman@b...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; The behavior of ComparisonFailure.getMessage() is to replace\n&gt; equivalient parts of the actual and expected strings with &quot;...&quot;. In \nmy\n&gt; opinion, this is truly dreadful behavior. Yet there seems to be no \nway\n&gt; to modify this behavior without changing the source code. And this \nis\n&gt; because of what is, IMHO and with all due respect to Beck and Gamma,\n&gt; bad design: all the Assert.assert* methods are static.\n&gt; \n&gt; While a discussion of the design decisions in junit would probably \nbe\n&gt; enlightening, that&#39;s not my goal; here. I would just like \nsuggestions\n&gt; of how to get the strings, in their entirities, into the output.\n&gt; \n&gt; Perhaps the answer is to write my own subclass of TestRunner, but \nthen\n&gt; I would have to figure out how to integrate the new TestRunner into\n&gt; JBuilder.\n&gt; \n&gt; Any help would be appreciated.\n\n\n",
