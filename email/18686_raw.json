Regardless of how well one \nprogram can reason about the behavior of another, it requires that the \nprogram reason about the intent of the original programmer.  The \nautomated tests _may_ be able to assess that the code is doing what it \nit written to do, but how can it determine that it wasn&#39;t written to do \nthe right thing?\n\nWe use unit tests to make sure that the software is doing what it is \ndoing the correct thing, as well as making sure that it does what it \ndoes correctly.\n\nJim\n\nJ.

It&#39;s a shame that such tools simply cannot\n&gt; exist beyond the very simplest methods. If it were so easy to do, it\n&gt; would be done. I&#39;m no complexity/computational theory expert, but from\n&gt; what I understand, there is very little any program can reason about the\n&gt; behavior of any other program, so the tool you describe above probably\n&gt; can&#39;t be useful for any non-trivial system.\n&gt; \n&gt; As for the question of whether the method is tested exhaustively, that\n&gt; depends on how well the test-generating code is tested... and then it&#39;s\n&gt; turtles all the way down: an infinite regression. It simply pushes the\n&gt; problem to the next programmer.\n&gt; -- \n&gt; J. B.
