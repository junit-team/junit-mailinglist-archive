Thats how I \n&gt; understand Design by Contract. \n\nDBC is not about testing. Not even Mr. Bertrand Meyer (the inventor \nof DBC) claims that. If you wanted to test correctnes of \nimplementatio with DBC you would have to duplicate a function&#39;s \nalgorithm - or an equivalent one - in its postcondition. Tests don&#39;t \nsuffer from that dilemma since tests can work with samples.\n\n&gt; Now the great thing: When you compile your code the implementation \n&gt; can be checked whether it obeys the contract.\n\nDBC is not about compile time verification but about runtime checks. \nCode verification has some relationship to DBC but is a different \nfield of research. \n\n&gt; If not, a compile error \n&gt; is thrown. That it! \n\nNo, that&#39;s not what happens when using DBC.\n\n&gt; I am not satisfied with the JUnit and TDD &quot;paradigma&quot;. They are \n&gt; originated because of a *poverty* in Java programing language. If \n&gt; Java would support proper Design by Contract and a compiler for \nthat \n&gt; than no one would bother with JUnit and TDD.\n\nAny reason for EiffelUnit to exist then? \n(http://freshmeat.net/projects/eiffelunit)\n\nJohannes\n\nPS: Is this thread a troll?\n\n\n\n",
