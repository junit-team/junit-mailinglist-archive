    "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1738427505\">The main difference between Rule and what you suggest is that Rule acts as a true composition where the class it is being used in doesnt define the behavior of the Rule, instead it uses the Behavior. In your case you are defining as well as using the behavior in the same class.  This is a perspective issue. I always look at the fact that a single class should define and handle single behavior. <br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as DataLoader annotation goes in the EasyTest framework, the biggest difference between what you suggest in your gist and what DataProvider does is that a user is not required to use @DataProvider at the method level. He can simply use the annotation at the class level and the framework will take care of the rest. A user can simply say @test on its test method and the framework will take care of the rest. As I said before, the functionality of applying the DataLoader annotation at the method level is for completeness purpose and not a mandatory requirement.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I am not objecting to your solution of asking a user to provide a static class per test method, but I am presenting my view point that I would personally not be using such a Runner/behavior. But again that is just me. There could be a lot of people who may find this idea very interesting. But I am not one of them unfortunately :(.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers!<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a>, Matthew Farwell &lt;matthew@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I really think that you don&#39;t understand my use case here, I&#39;m sorry.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; This is my use case. I have a class which contains multiple methods that I<br/>\n&gt; wish to test. Each test requires it&#39;s own, specific data set. I cannot use<br/>\n&gt; Parameterized because I must define a constructor, and I cannot have<br/>\n&gt; multiple constructors. I would like to make my job easier by being able to<br/>\n&gt; say test this method with this dataset.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I use Parameterized a lot, and I have absolutely no problem with defining<br/>\n&gt; the data in my class, just like it is suggested in the javadoc for<br/>\n&gt; Parameterized.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; If I could use the same data set for all of the methods I wished to test,<br/>\n&gt; then I could use the current implementation of Parameterized. So see my<br/>\n&gt; comments inline.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 2012/8/29 Anuj &lt;anujkumar1516@...&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; **<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; A Side note first: The gist has a comma along with it, therefore it<br/>\n&gt; &gt; doesn&#39;t work when clicked. :)<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Matthew, being a JUnit user for so long, personally I would repel at the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; idea of writing static classes that extend an interface in my test class.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Here are my reasons:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; You don&#39;t use Rules? These are effectively the same thing. You extend a<br/>\n&gt; class/interface and reimplement a method. Effectively the same thing here.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 1) It makes the whole process of writing test cases more complicated.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Also, the writing test cases is now coupled with writing test data. A<br/>\n&gt; &gt; tester cannot work exclusively on writing test data without concerning<br/>\n&gt; &gt; himself from the test cases. This leads to coupling. We should allow the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; user to write test data separately from the test case.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; I can understand what you&#39;re saying about separation of tests & test data,<br/>\n&gt; but that&#39;s not what I want to do. I have no problem with the data and tests<br/>\n&gt; being in the same physical file. In fact, I prefer that because I&#39;m doing<br/>\n&gt; unit testing. In the past, I have defined my test data in another file, but<br/>\n&gt; that&#39;s not what I&#39;m talking about here.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 2) We, as developers, get only a fraction of the time to write test cases,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and therefore the less time we have to spend on writing and executing the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; test cases, the better.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 3) There is a problem of maintenance here. I personally believe that, the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; less you make a user depend on your framework, the better it is. Junit&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; &gt; @Test is actually a classic example of how easy it is to get up and running<br/>\n&gt; &gt; without the user thinking about any external dependencies. The user doesn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; &gt; have to follow a nice learning curve and know the APIs. That&#39;s where<br/>\n&gt; &gt; annotations are so powerful.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I don&#39;t understand what you&#39;re trying to say in either of these points.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;  4) In your above gist as well(just like the previous one), a user has to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; provide annotation at the method level, which, as I pointed out before, can<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and ideally should be avoided. The user should be able to say(in terms of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; writing test cases) something like : &quot;Here is my test data which contains<br/>\n&gt; &gt; data for each test method I have in my test class. Now run all the methods<br/>\n&gt; &gt; that are Tests and pass the right parameters to them.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; Like I say above, if I could define something at class level, then I<br/>\n&gt; wouldn&#39;t need to add this functionality to JUnit. Also, in your easytest<br/>\n&gt; framework, you have annotation which applies at method level, so I don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; what you&#39;re objecting to.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Well, that&#39;s where atleast my money lies and that&#39;s what I have tried to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; capture in EasyTest.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Again, it is a philosophical discussion which can have a lot of rights and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; wrongs. Whenever I design any software, my philosophy always is: &quot;Think<br/>\n&gt; &gt; about what the users would be required to learn/code about my software, in<br/>\n&gt; &gt; order to get up and running with my system.&quot; The less the user needs to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; learn and depend on an external system, the better and faster the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; development. Obviously, there are situations where certain things cannot be<br/>\n&gt; &gt; avoided, and then we make informed decisions. :)<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Cheers!<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Anuj<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a>, Matthew Farwell &lt;matthew@&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; One thing that you can&#39;t do is stack runners, so you can&#39;t use Enclosed<br/>\n&gt; &gt; in<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; conjunction with other runners.

If a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; user wants to do two different things, but have them accessible in the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; file<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; system in one place, the Enclosed runner is always available:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; @RunWith(Enclosed.class)<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; public class FooTest {<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; public static class Thing1 { ... }<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; public static class Thing2 { ... }<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; }<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; IMHO, classes are how Java groups methods and data that belong<br/>\n&gt; &gt; together.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I&#39;m reluctant to introduce new ways of grouping (such as annotations on<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; methods that contain the names of other methods) if equivalent<br/>\n&gt; &gt; class-based<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; techniques will work.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; David Saff<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; On Tue, Aug 28, 2012 at 10:23 AM, Anuj &lt;anujkumar1516@&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; **<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Het Matthew,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I think my previous mail got lost as I cannot see it being delivered<br/>\n&gt; &gt; to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the group even after 3 hours.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; So here is my response once again:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 1) Parameterized runner does not work in a way that I was talking<br/>\n&gt; &gt; about<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; DataLoader below. It has the drawback that if you provide a single<br/>\n&gt; &gt; set of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; test data for multiple methods, it will pass all the test data to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; all the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; methods. Have a look at this blog post for more clarification of the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Parameterized Runner and its drawback:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.kumaranuj.com/2012/08/junits-parameterized-runner-and-data.html\">http://www.kumaranuj.com/2012/08/junits-parameterized-runner-and-data.html</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 2) I feel a new runner would be a better approach although I do not<br/>\n&gt; &gt; know<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; what all feature set will this runner support.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 3) I feel it is easier and also simpler if we get rid of the whole<br/>\n&gt; &gt; idea<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; providing method names. I say this because in real world scenario,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; no two<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; test methods will have exactly the same set of test data. Thus the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; name<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the method should suffice instead of asking the user to explicitly<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; specify<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the method name in the annotation.

This<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; seems<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; undesirable as it promotes duplicacy within the test class.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Moreover,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; running each test method would mean extra processing, which can<br/>\n&gt; &gt; be<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; avoided<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; by making the annotation support ElementType.TYPE as well.

However, since we&#39;re specifying the name of the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; method<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; our DataProvider (if dataProviderClass is not specified), why not<br/>\n&gt; &gt; be<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; able<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to specify it in the dataProviderClass? The main difference would<br/>\n&gt; &gt; be<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the method would need to be static in our class, whereas in the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; dataProviderClass it could be non-static.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 3)I somehow get the feeling(and it could be simply me and if that<br/>\n&gt; &gt; is<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; case, please ignore me) that the aspect of performing Data Driven<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Testing<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; should be given more time, and proper thought should be put in<br/>\n&gt; &gt; around<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; its<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; design and the way it will be made available to the end users. I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; feel<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; we<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; should not rush into developing a feature focusing a single use<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; case/requirement, rather we should try to first gather and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; understand<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; all<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the aspects of Data Driven Testing and then develop that<br/>\n&gt; &gt; requirement<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; as a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; whole rather than in pieces.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I&#39;m not rushing, that&#39;s why I&#39;m asking the question on the junit<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mailing<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; list :-) However, I think this is a generalization of the current<br/>\n&gt; &gt; usage<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Parameterized, and this would be useful, to me at least.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Matthew.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I would be much more beneficial to the community as a whole.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Anuj<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a>, Matthew Farwell &lt;matthew@&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hello,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sorry this took so long to get back to you, but I was trying<br/>\n&gt; &gt; to get<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; my<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; thoughts together.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I don&#39;t believe that the suggestion below fits in with the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; current<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; JUnit<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; philospohy, so doesn&#39;t belong in the junit core library.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Specifically, I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; don&#39;t think CSV/Excel/XML parsing belongs in JUnit, so I agree<br/>\n&gt; &gt; with<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; your<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; decision to write it as an extension rather than as part of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; junit<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; core.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; However, I do believe that we can add stuff to JUnit core in<br/>\n&gt; &gt; order<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; allow<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; people to do this sort of thing more easily, and maybe help you<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; with<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; your<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; code as well.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I often have the following problem: I&#39;ve got a class Foo in<br/>\n&gt; &gt; which<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; testing multiple methods (foo#addInts & foo#addStrings). So I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; create<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; single class to test the two. But if either of these methods<br/>\n&gt; &gt; are<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; better<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; tested using parameterized, then I can&#39;t do it because I have<br/>\n&gt; &gt; to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; define<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; constructor. So, what I would propose is to have a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; @DataProvider<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; annotation<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; which specifies a method to call which returns a collection of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; data<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; for<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; this particular method. The test method is called for each<br/>\n&gt; &gt; item in<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; list. See <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://gist.github.com/3471426\">https://gist.github.com/3471426</a> for a short<br/>\n&gt; &gt; proposal. I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; think<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; this would be fairly easy to do.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I also think this would be extensible in another framework,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; specifically<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; your case.
