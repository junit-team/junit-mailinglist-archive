Trust me, we&#39;ve not rewritten the framework.\n\nThe only thing we&#39;ve more or less rewritten is the runner.  The reason\nfor this is simply that the corresponding runner package didn&#39;t exit\nthree years ago (we are talking JUnit 3.1 or even 3.0 here when Thomas\nan myself started to work on the Ant integration).  Ant still supports\nJUnit 3.0, that&#39;s why we can&#39;t change the implementation easily.\n\n&gt; It seems (from reading this) that ant leverages the testcase class\n&gt; &quot;assert&quot; helper methods & little else.\n\nAs Scott points out, the TestListener concept is heavily relied upon\nin Ant.\n\n&gt; That said, I have a problem when running them inside Eclipse &#39;cos\n&gt; they (I believe) use paths relative to the project they are in.\n\nMore likely the current working directory.\n\n&gt; The Eclipse test collector finds tests in dependent projects,\n\nI have little to no experience with running BuildFileTest subclasses\noutside of the scope of Ant&#39;s &lt;junit&gt; task, sorry.\n\n&gt; Any thoughts on how I solve this, or if there are one or two bugs I\n&gt; ought report?\n\nIf you can pin down the problems, you certainly should report them as\nbugs, thanks.  8-) Even if you can&#39;t provide a patch, it may be worth\na report.\n\nStefan\n\n",
