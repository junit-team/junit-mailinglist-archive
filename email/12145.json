I just want that manager to SAY IT. To me, that&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; important.

It&#39;s<br/>\nthe VP of the organization, who has given up trying to buck the<br/>\nstandards officers. And they don&#39;t believe that my procedure will<br/>\nhelp, but they are certain that the standard they worked so hard to<br/>\nput into place solved a lot of problems for them - and have seen chaos<br/>\nensue with programmers spitting out chicken heads all over the<br/>\nplace...<br/>\n<br/>\nLarge organizations tend to lack the immediacy of accountability which<br/>\nfacilitates progress.<br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; PROGRAMMER: &quot;As long as we&#39;re clear that the corporate standard is more<br/>\n&gt; important than how productive I can be as a programmer, I&#39;m fine with<br/>\n&gt; that. By the way, I won&#39;t be working any unpaid overtime this year.<br/>\n&gt; Sorry about that.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Easier to say when unemployment is low :)</div>",
