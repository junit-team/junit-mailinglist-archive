Look at the source of the junit.framework.Assert class. All \nof the assert*()s that compare primitives ultimately call fail(), with a \nnull message argument if no message was used as the first argument to \nassert*(). This is the &#39;null&#39; that you see in the test result printout. \nIs this horrible user feedback? Yes. Note that the assertions for \nStrings and Objects, instead of calling fail(), throw a \nComparisonFailure object. This is an extension of AssertionFailedError \nthat crafts an exception message string that&#39;s a bit more user-friendly \n(i.e. the infamous &quot;expected &lt;....&gt; but was &lt;...&gt;&quot; message).\n\nIIRC, the junit-addons package \n(http://sourceforge.net/projects/junit-addons) has an alternative Assert \nclass that prints out much nicer exception messages.\n\n&gt; I&#39;ve never heard of such behaviour. What version of JUnit are you using?\n&gt; --\n&gt; Stephen Smith, MEng (Wales).\n&gt; http://www.stephen-smith.co.uk/ &lt;http://www.stephen-smith.co.uk/&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; yogamatt1970 wrote:\n&gt;  &gt; If I leave it like this:\n&gt;  &gt; assertTrue(spannedString.indexOf(sample)&gt; -1);\n&gt;  &gt; I see the null message when the assertion fails but if I change it to\n&gt;  &gt; this:\n&gt;  &gt; assertTrue(&quot;hello&quot;,spannedString.indexOf(sample)&gt; -1);\n&gt;  &gt; I see the message hello get printed to stout.\n&gt;  &gt; This seems to happen with most (if not all) of the Junit assert\n&gt;  &gt; methods for me.\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; --- In junit@yahoogroups.com &lt;mailto:junit%40yahoogroups.com&gt;, \n&gt; didoss@... wrote:\n&gt;  &gt;&gt; What, exactly, does your assert look like your test?\n&gt;  &gt;&gt;\n&gt;  &gt;&gt; It sounds like you have used the signature that expects a string and\n&gt;  &gt; the assertion argument(s), instead of using the one with just the\n&gt;  &gt; assertion argument(s),...though I&#39;ve never tried it, to see if I get\n&gt;  &gt; the results you are seeing, and I&#39;ve never seen the results you are\n&gt;  &gt; seeing to know of another reason why you would get it.\n&gt;  &gt;&gt; Please paste your assertion, so that we can help you further.\n&gt;  &gt;&gt;\n&gt;  &gt;&gt;\n&gt;  &gt;&gt; thanks,\n&gt;  &gt;&gt; Dianne\n&gt;  &gt;&gt;\n&gt;  &gt;&gt; -------------- Original message --------------\n&gt;  &gt;&gt; From: &quot;yogamatt1970&quot; &lt;yogamatt1970@...&gt;\n&gt;  &gt;&gt; OK, apologies in advance if this has been asked before - I searched\n&gt;  &gt;&gt; around the forum here and could not find an answer to my question:\n&gt;  &gt;&gt;\n&gt;  &gt;&gt; I&#39;ve noticed that if I don&#39;t supply the optional string argument to\n&gt;  &gt;&gt; many (perhaps all) of Junit&#39;s assert methods, I get an error message\n&gt;  &gt;&gt; that looks like this:\n&gt;  &gt;&gt; [junit] null\n&gt;  &gt;&gt; [junit] junit.framework.AssertionFailedError\n&gt;  &gt;&gt;\n&gt;  &gt;&gt; I find this to be confusing. However, if I include the optional\n&gt;  &gt;&gt; string argument, then that message is displayed in the output.\n&gt;  &gt;&gt; I have a very high opinion of the Junit framework and find it hard to\n&gt;  &gt;&gt; believe that the null message is standard behavior. It feels so\n&gt;  &gt;&gt; clunky, almost as if Junit does not check to see if the optional\n&gt;  &gt;&gt; argument was passed or not. My guess is that there&#39;s a property\n&gt;  &gt;&gt; somewhere which allows me disable the null error but I can&#39;t find it.\n&gt;  &gt;&gt; My other option is to just add a string argument to all of the\n&gt;  &gt;&gt; asserts in all of my unit tests (at this point, not that many although\n&gt;  &gt;&gt; it would still be a pain and would probably take me at least a few\n&gt;  &gt; hours).\n&gt;  &gt;&gt; Any and all help is appreciated.\n\n\n",
