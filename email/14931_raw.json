B. Rainsberger&#39;s suggestion of adding a test\n&gt; &gt; name to each set of parameters?  Would that address these concerns?\n&gt;\n&gt; It helps in part. However it relies too much on programmer design for my\n&gt; comfort. This could become very obscure and opaque very quickly.\n\nCan you expand on &quot;relies too much on programmer design&quot;?  I think I \nmight know what you mean, but best to make sure.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; This certainly shouldn&#39;t be seen as a replacement of any\n&gt; &gt; non-parameterized JUnit 3 tests. \n&gt;\n&gt; And yet I&#39;m afraid that&#39;s how it will be seen by many programmers. A lot\n&gt; of the JUnit test suites I see in practice, including some I&#39;ve written,\n&gt; push way too much into one method. I was just looking at one a couple of\n&gt; days ago that had about two methods in the entire test suite, and these\n&gt; two methods tested everything. Adding specialized support for\n&gt; parameterized test cases like this will just make it easier and more\n&gt; convenient for programmers to do the wrong thing. I&#39;m afraid this will\n&gt; be just too tempting and be use far more often than it should be.\n\nI would certainly hope that the documentation for JUnit 4 will present \nthese annotations as being fairly deep in the bag of JUnit tricks, to \nprevent an outbreak of novices with bulletholes in their feet.  Can you \nbe more specific with an example of a test suite done the right way in \nJUnit 3, which would be more likely to be done the wrong way in JUnit 4 \n+ @Parameters?  Are you imagining something like this?\n\nclass FibTest extends TestCase {\n    public void testZero() {\n       assertEquals(0, fib(0));\n    }\n\n    public void testOne() {\n       assertEquals(1, fib(1));\n    }\n\n    public void testTwo() {\n       assertEquals(1, fib(2));\n    }\n}\n\nBecoming:\n\nclass FibTest {\n    @Parameters public static int[][] data= new int[][] {{0, 0}, {1, 1}, \n{2, 1}};\n\n    @Parameter(0) public int expected;\n    @Parameter(1) public int input;\n\n    @Test public void test() {\n        assertEquals(expected, fib(input));\n    }\n}\n\n&gt; On the other hand, it might mean more tests get written since it&#39;s a lot\n&gt; easier to add a line to an array of parameters than a whole new method.\n&gt; that would be a good thing. But it definitely leads away from *unit*\n&gt; testing. I think we&#39;ll see more functional and integration tests with\n&gt; this and fewer unit tests (not that the lines between them aren&#39;t fuzzy\n&gt; already) I&#39;m not sure whether the advantages outweigh the disadvantages\n&gt; or not.\n\nWhy would an available syntax for parameterized test cases lead to more \nfunctional tests and fewer unit tests?\n\n    David Saff\n\n",
