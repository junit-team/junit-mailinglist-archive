Otherwise IllegalAccessException occure which make \n&gt; my test results red.\n&gt; \n&gt; The Javadoc 1.3 says that this is because the two classes are not in \n&gt; the same package.\n&gt; \n&gt; But in the company we put all tests in a sub package named &quot;test&quot;.\n&gt; \n&gt; Does anyone had such a problem before and know a solution? I mean a \n&gt; solution where the two classes are in different packages.\n&gt; \n&gt; Maybe there is an easy solution for it.\n\n\n\n",
