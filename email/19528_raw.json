My apologies in advance if =\r\nthis has been hashed out\nbefore.\n&gt; \n&gt; While generally thinking that its not=\r\n a great idea, I occasionally\n&gt; come into a situation where I genuinely nee=\r\nd to partition my tests\n&gt; into more than one group or partition or suite.  =\r\nThe latest example is\n&gt; with a client who has many unit style tests as well=\r\n as a number of\n&gt; tests which require specific network connectivity only av=\r\nailable from\n&gt; a subset of machines (the outgoing requests must come from a=\r\n specific\n&gt; ip address).  We call these the &quot;online tests&quot;.\n&gt; \n&gt; We want to=\r\n be able to group our tests into two groups, &quot;unit tests&quot;\n&gt; and &quot;online tes=\r\nts&quot;.  In some case we want to run only &quot;unit tests&quot; or\n&gt; only &quot;online tests=\r\n&quot;, and in other cases we want to run both (or all).\n&gt; \n&gt; I understand that =\r\nthis functionality is available using JUnit 4&#39;s\n&gt; @RunWith(Suite.class) and=\r\n @SuiteClasses(TestClass1.class, ...). \n&gt; However, manually adding test cla=\r\nsses to a suite is clunky because the\n&gt; list of  test classes becomes huge.=\r\n  It&#39;s also error prone; it&#39;s easy\n&gt; for developers to write a test but for=\r\nget to add it to @SuiteClass. \n&gt; Lastly, test runners will run test in suit=\r\nes multiple times when told\n&gt; to &quot;run all tests&quot;.  That&#39;s hardly the desire=\r\nd behavior.\n&gt; \n&gt; What I really would like to see is the concept of suite (o=\r\nr group in\n&gt; TestNG terms) be promoted to a first class citizen.  Honestly,=\r\n I think\n&gt;  I would prefer it to be at the test class level (unlike TestNG =\r\nwhich\n&gt; is at the test method level), since the mechanism should be used fo=\r\nr\n&gt; high-level organization IMHO.\n&gt; \n&gt; Is there any chance something like t=\r\nhis might make its way into JUnit?\n&gt; What can I do to help?\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt; =\r\nChristian\n\n\n",
