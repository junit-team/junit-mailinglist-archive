Decorators<br/>\nintroduced in annotations also lead to code that is difficult to analyze<br/>\nstatically. Would it be possible to create a helper class that you invoke<br/>\nfrom @Befores? For example:<br/>\n<br/>\n@Before expensiveSetup() {<br/>\n  fixture= new ExpensiveFixture();<br/>\n  fixture.setUp();<br/>\n}<br/>\n<br/>\nWe simplified JUnit by unifying the two phases of creating the tests and<br/>\nexecuting the tests, but now we need to reintroduce some of the flexibility<br/>\nwe removed. We have exhausted our ideas for the API for dynamically created<br/>\ntests. We would like to see concrete proposals for the API. In the meantime,<br/>\nyou can still use old classes with suite() methods with the JUnit 4 test<br/>\nrunner.<br/>\n<br/>\nSincerely yours,<br/>\n<br/>\nKent Beck<br/>\nThree Rivers Institute<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a>] On <br/>\n&gt; Behalf Of Robert Watkins<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Thursday, June 16, 2005 5:36 AM<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: [junit] JUnit 4<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Kent Beck wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Robert,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; This is an interesting idea. It would be very powerful. I&#39;m <br/>\n&gt; having trouble<br/>\n&gt; &gt; understanding what you would use it for beyond what you can do with<br/>\n&gt; &gt; @Before/@After and @BeforeClass and @AfterClass, though. Do <br/>\n&gt; you have an<br/>\n&gt; &gt; example?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Kent,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; It&#39;s not so much that I think it couldn&#39;t be done with the existing <br/>\n&gt; annotations, as that it would be more elegant if a decorator <br/>\n&gt; annotation was <br/>\n&gt; directly available.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; An example that I&#39;ve got right at hand is a decorator I used <br/>\n&gt; to set up the <br/>\n&gt; JNDI space with mock objects, so that the code-under-test had <br/>\n&gt; access to <br/>\n&gt; expected resources. I used a decorator, rather than a base <br/>\n&gt; class, because I <br/>\n&gt; needed this to be available across several different test <br/>\n&gt; hierarchies, some <br/>\n&gt; of which already extended from different sub-class of TestCase. An <br/>\n&gt; alternative would have been to use a duplicated setUp() <br/>\n&gt; method. But this <br/>\n&gt; was ugly duplication... Another good example would be for using IoC <br/>\n&gt; techniques on the test itself.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; With the @Before/@After annotations, I could do something <br/>\n&gt; similar. But it <br/>\n&gt; would still be duplication that would be annoying. With an annotation <br/>\n&gt; decorator I&#39;d be able to reduce that duplication to a single <br/>\n&gt; declaration of <br/>\n&gt; intent.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; More generally, however, I&#39;d like a way to extend JUnit <br/>\n&gt; without fighting <br/>\n&gt; it. There are some powerful techniques in JUnit 3.8 that I <br/>\n&gt; wouldn&#39;t want to <br/>\n&gt; lose, for example - one such is the ability to <br/>\n&gt; programatically create test <br/>\n&gt; cases (see <br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://twasink.net/blog/archives/2003/10/junit_and_datad.html\">http://twasink.net/blog/archives/2003/10/junit_and_datad.html</a> <br/>\n&gt; for more on this - or Chapter 4.8 of JB Rainsberger&#39;s &quot;JUnit <br/>\n&gt; Recipes&quot;). In <br/>\n&gt; JUnit 4, there appears to be no way to do the same thing; I&#39;d <br/>\n&gt; be forced to <br/>\n&gt; have a single test, which read the data file iteratively - <br/>\n&gt; needless to say, <br/>\n&gt; this wouldn&#39;t give me the same level of granularity in reports.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; In fact, in order to get the same level of flexibility in <br/>\n&gt; JUnit 4 as is in <br/>\n&gt; JUnit 3, you&#39;d need at the very least to give an equivalent <br/>\n&gt; of the suite() <br/>\n&gt; method - currently, there is no way to change the way that <br/>\n&gt; test instances <br/>\n&gt; are obtained. Perhaps a test class could define a TestFactory <br/>\n&gt; annotation, <br/>\n&gt; which would default to the TestInstropector?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; (Actually, for the ultimate in flexibility, you&#39;d need to <br/>\n&gt; provide a way to <br/>\n&gt; change the runner strategy, too - but that&#39;s probably overkill)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Ultimately, what I would like to be able to do is have equivalents of <br/>\n&gt; popular JUnit extensions, such as DBUnit, ServletUnit, and <br/>\n&gt; JUnitPerf, which <br/>\n&gt; are configured using annotations rather than base classes. <br/>\n&gt; The annotations <br/>\n&gt; currently in JUnit 4 wouldn&#39;t allow this.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; (Cedric, if you&#39;re reading this... every one of these points <br/>\n&gt; applies to <br/>\n&gt; TestNG as well)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -- <br/>\n&gt;                 &quot;Software is too expensive to build cheaply&quot;<br/>\n&gt; Robert Watkins         <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://twasink.net/\">http://twasink.net/</a>          <br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:robertdw@...\">robertdw@...</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; Yahoo!
