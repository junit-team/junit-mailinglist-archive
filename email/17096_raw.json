While all of\nthe things that you&#39;re suggesting to cover are well and good, I would\nstrongly recommend getting all of your students grounded in basic\nJUnit for a couple of days. Then let them have a few days/weeks to use\nit against actual code and then bring them back in for a followup\nclass on the basics again. Hold off on mockobjects, db or web testing\nuntil they can write standard tests in their sleep.\n\nJUnit is a great tool, but getting developers to use even the basics\nis a challenge. Don&#39;t ask any more of them than the basics to start\nwith.\n\nSimon\n\nOn 7/6/06, Vijay &lt;vijay_nathani@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; I am posting this message again with some more details. I need help on\n&gt; this issue. I would appreciate if someone helps me.\n&gt;\n&gt; I am designing a course on Testing. The course should train the\n&gt; participants on all the practical tools used for testing. The suggested\n&gt; course contents are\n&gt;\n&gt; 1) Using Junit for unit testing\n&gt; 2) Mock objects. (Which is better JMock or EasyMock?)\n&gt; 3) DBUnit for database testing.\n&gt; 4) Web testing. (Which tool is the best HtmlUnit or JWebTest or\n&gt; Selenium?)\n&gt; 5) Acceptance testing with FIT. (Is this tool used by many people?)\n&gt;\n&gt; If possible, I would appreciate comments from the group regarding\n&gt; topics to be added in /deleted from this course and also the questions\n&gt; in the above message.\n&gt; Thanks............Vijay\n&gt; www.geocites.com/vijay_nathani\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
