The <br/>\ndefault JUnit test runner makes those decisions, and I agree it&#39;s <br/>\nannoying the way the current test-collecting behavior is hardwired as <br/>\nclass-level methods. That said, combine GSBase&#39;s &quot;RecursiveTestSuite&quot; or <br/>\nJUnit-addons&#39; &quot;DirectorySuiteBuilder&quot; with a filter that examines any <br/>\nmetadat you want, and you can run any subset of the tests you can imagine.<br/>\n<br/>\nAgreed, TestNG supports this out of the box, but for every neat feature <br/>\nTestNG supports out of the box there will be 20 people crying about this <br/>\nother neat feature it doesn&#39;t support... it&#39;s for that reason that JUnit <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t even try. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nOne big difference between the two is that JUnit assumes that the test <br/>\nsuite is computed before the first test runs, and I admit that is a <br/>\nfundamental and useful difference between JUnit and TestNG. I suppose <br/>\nonce TestNG has a large user base we&#39;ll have a clearer idea how <br/>\nimportant that is. (I know that day is approaching!)<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;snip /&gt;<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Or you can use marker interfaces to the same purpose:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; public class FooTest implements NeedsDatabaseTest, FunctionalTest { ... }<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; and simply have a test collector that finds all of the classes that<br/>\n&gt; include or exclude particular marker interfaces.  How are annotations<br/>\n&gt; superior to just using interfaces like that?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You could say that marker annotations are &quot;merely&quot; syntax sugar <br/>\nreplacing marker interfaces. That said, syntax sugar done well is very <br/>\nnice. Also, annotations were /designed/ for this kind of thing, and <br/>\ninterfaces weren&#39;t. Interfaces are not metadata, even if they can be <br/>\nmetadata. My butter knife can be a screwdriver, but that doesn&#39;t mean I <br/>\nshould avoid buying a screwdriver.<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJ. B.
