This class has a lot\n&gt; of static methods on it for loading properties files and\n&gt; getting properties back out:\n&gt; [...]\n&gt; This scenario is not very testable. I like the idea of a\n&gt; static class to pull application properties from, but it\n&gt; makes testing more difficult. I could load the AppProperties\n&gt; object in the setUp (that is my solution to get it working\n&gt; until I get better suggestions), but it seems like the app\n&gt; should be designed a little differently.\n\nThe AppProperties methods could use a private static member to do \nthe detailed work.  And then you could use MockObject, during \ntesting, to control the static member object&#39;s behavior.\n\nThis can quickly lead to AppProperties being a Singleton.  That&#39;s \nOK; the tests can swap in a MockObject in setUp and clear or reset \nit on tearDown.\n\nSingleton is not ideal, but it can be refactored later to remove the \nSingleton-ness.\n\n&gt; How would something like this be handled in IoC (DI) projects? \n\nOther objects would accept an AppProperties instance in their \nconstructor or in a &quot;set&quot; method, and keep it in a local variable.  \nYou can migrate from Singleton to this pattern, over time.\n\n\n\n",
