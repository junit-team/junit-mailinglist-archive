I&#39;m using the java.lang.String class as the object being\n&gt; tested, so that we only have to worry about writing one class instead\n&gt; of two.\n&gt;\n&gt; My question is: When testing overloaded methods (String.indexOf() in\n&gt; this specific case), is it better for each overloaded method get it&#39;s\n&gt; own testXXX() method or is it ok to lump them all in the one test? I\n&gt; have them all in one test right now, on the grounds that the test is\n&gt; against the index feature, rather than the individual methods.\n\nRule of thumb is that each separate method should get a separate test.\n\nIn this case, since the audience has a COBOL background, I would\ncertainly recommend giving each overloaded method its own test method.\nYou need to get it clear in people&#39;s heads that overloaded methods are\nin fact separate things.\n\nIn general there will be a number of assertions per test.  You want to\ntest at boundary points, so there should be assertions on at least\n\n* an empty string\n* a case where the match is at the beginning\n* a case where the match is at the end\n* a case where there is no match\n\nand probably one assertion on\n\n* a case where the match is in the middle\n\nSome people would put each assertion into a separate test method.\nThis is a quasi-religious issue for some.   I would usually group\nall of the assertions into one test method.  Unless I was actually\nimplementing the indexOf() method, in which case I would probably not\nbe so brave ;-)\n\n--\nJim Dixon  jdd@...   tel +44 117 982 0786  mobile +44 797 373 7881\n\n\n",
