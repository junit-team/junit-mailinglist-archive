Particularly in the area of visibility.. many developers assume \n&gt; that no written agreement can be sufficient if something is made \n&gt; public.  I think that the issue is that we are not used to thinking \n&gt; about agreements beyond the code and we&#39;re not used to holding people to \n&gt; them.\n\nAn agreement might work. I&#39;ve never seen anyone try one. Instead what \nI&#39;ve seen is the developers issue pronouncements from on high about how \nusers must use their software and APIs, and then be appalled when users \nignore them. Actually sitting down and invoking the users in the design, \nand getting their explicit buy-in would be an interesting exercise. Hmm, \nyou know I have seen that and I have even done that, but only with a \nsmall subset of the user base. For a project with a large user base, I \ndon&#39;t think you could ever expect meaningful discussion and agreement \nwith each individual user.\n\nNow I&#39;m not objecting to pronouncements, mind you. I&#39;m a very \npatriarchical designer in my own APIs, and I make lots of pronouncements \nfrom on high. However I don&#39;t delude myself that the users have somehow \nagreed to this. That&#39;s why I enforce the pronouncements in code.\n\n-- \n﻿Elliotte Rusty Harold  elharo@...\nJava I/O 2nd Edition Just Published!\nhttp://www.cafeaulait.org/books/javaio2/\nhttp://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0596527500/ref=nosim/cafeaulaitA/\n\n",
