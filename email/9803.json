From the Fixture section on JUnit Web site:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &lt;snip /&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; What you just snipped out was taken directly from the JUnit Web <br/>\n&gt; site. Just to keep things clear, let&#39;s put it back in:<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>How does that keep things clear?  You mean carved in stone,<br/>\nunchangable, and not subject to interpretation?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &quot;Tests need to run against the background of a known set of objects. <br/>\n&gt; This set of objects is called a test fixture.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yes.  Ideally each INSTANCE of each SUBCLASS of the TestCase class<br/>\nembodies a single fixture.  The class describes that fixture.  By that<br/>\nI mean that all test methods in the class run in the context of that<br/>\nfixture in a maximally cohesive way (i.e. it is not the case that some<br/>\ntests uses part of the fixture and other tests use some other part of<br/>\nthe fixture).<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Pay close attention, class.  The set of objects is the fixture.  The<br/>\n&gt; fixture is what you set up.  This is clear and unambiguous English <br/>\n&gt; from the authors of JUnit.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>and that is embodied in a subclass of TestCase.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; Let us try this again, with one slight correction.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Ah.. but in proper usage each fixture is a different TestCase<br/>\n </span></blockquote>class...&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nExactly right J.B.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; *  this is simply your interpretation,<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>And mine.  And (see later) aparently also Kent&#39;s... hey.. he&#39;s one of<br/>\nthe author&#39;s of JUnit.  And since you want to nitpick, you should be<br/>\nsaying &quot;xUnit&quot;, the original implementation being SUnit.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; in which case you should defer to what the authors of JUnit.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Why?  Are things not allowed to evolve beyond what they wrote down<br/>\nwhen they created JUnit?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; For that matter, if I google I get<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Of what relavance is this?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; It would seem that if this text appears anywhere, Google hasn&#39;t <br/>\n&gt; noticed it.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Google aparently limits it&#39;s reading to the web.<br/>\n<br/>\nPage 74-78, &quot;Test-Driven Development: A Practical Guide&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t have Kent&#39;s book on had to check it... ah but I do still have<br/>\nthe Jul 17, 2002 draft, where on page 165 it says:<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;The relationship of subclasses of TestCase and instacne of those<br/>\nsubclasses is one of the most confusing parts of xUnit.  Each new kind<br/>\nof fixture should be in a new subclass of TestCase.  Each new fixture<br/>\nis created in an instance of that subclass, used once, then discarded.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nand further on the same page:<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;This implies that there is no simple relationship between test<br/>\nclasses and model classes.  Sometimes one fixture serves to test<br/>\nseveral classes (although this is reare).  Sometimes two or three<br/>\nfixtures are needed for a single model class.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI suggest you read the recent literature for the current ideas before<br/>\nquoting what you found on the web... especially documents that were<br/>\nwritten.. what... 5 or 6 years ago?<br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; &quot;fixture&quot; == TestCase class<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; OK?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Not really.  A TestCase always contains a fixture.  This may or may <br/>\n&gt; not be clearly distinguished by putting it in a setUp() method, but <br/>\n&gt; it&#39;s the set of objects that you are running your test against.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Which is what JB said.. and what I&#39;ve said, and what Kent&#39;s said...<br/>\nand many others as well.  The TestCase subclass is what defines a<br/>\nfixture.  setUp() just provides a tidy way of implementing that.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; If we are going to be truly nitpicking,<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Oh, lets... I feel the need to be lectured in OO basics.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; then recall that an object is an INSTANCE of a class.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Well... not always... in the common-place OO languages, sure.  But<br/>\nsometimes it&#39;s a copy of a prototype.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; A set of objects can never be a class.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Um.. well... I sort of disagree.  What exactly is a class?  It&#39;s the<br/>\ndescribtion of a set of objects.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; It is  a set of instances of a set of classes.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>which (in cool OOPLs anyway) are in turn instances of metaclasses ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; My apologies to the wider world for starting this absurd thread<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>No thread that stirs up dissention and discussion is absurd.  You<br/>\nwould prefer that we all sit around typing mediocre rubbish and<br/>\nsedately nodding at each other?<br/>\n<br/>\nDave</div>",
