I see the advantage of being able to reuse \n&gt; the existing unit-tests for performance testing without having to \n&gt; write the testcases again (maybe even in a different (scripting)\n&gt; language). But I&#39;m sure one has to bear in mind that the unit tests \n&gt; are to be used for performance testing as well, especially regarding \n&gt; granularity and test-data. I also fear that JUnit tests ususally tend \n&gt; to not represent user-behavior, which is supposed to be simulated \n&gt; during load-tests. But I&#39;m pretty sure than can be achieved with \n&gt; appropriate scheduling. \n&gt; \n&gt; So do you have any experience about how JUnit + JUnitPerf/+The \n&gt; Grinder/... competes against &quot;pure&quot; load-test tools like Mercury&#39;s \n&gt; LoadRunner, Rational Robot, OpenSTA, The Grinder(without JUnit) etc.?\n&gt; \n&gt; The reason why I&#39;m asking is because our developers start to use \n&gt; JUnit (I made them buy your book J.B. ;-) from now on (some already \n&gt; have used it) and I&#39;m dealing with developing performance/loadtesting \n&gt; processes. Most of our applications run as EJBs on Bea WLS 8.1 with \n&gt; oracle DBs. \n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks in advance,\n&gt; Thomas\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Yahoo!
