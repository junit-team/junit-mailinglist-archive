B. Rainsberger&quot; &lt;jbrains762@...&gt;\r\n\r\n[Mike Duffy...]\n&gt;I use the following naming convention for my test methods to keep\n&gt;things organized:\n&gt;\n&gt;     test_##_nameOfMethodBeingTested\n&gt;\n&gt;For example, the eigth test method for the method isAccountAssigned\n&gt;would be,\n&gt;\n&gt;     test_07_isAccountAssigned\n\nMike, you know I love you, buddy, but this grates me more and more I see it. \n:)\n\n&quot;07&quot; means nothing, except possibly to you. &quot;The eighth test for method X&quot; \nis also less useful than &quot;The test for method X that tries null parameters.&quot; \nThe number works great until you need 100 people to understand what&#39;s going \non. Can you replace the numbers with some meaningful words? You only have to \ntype it once.\n\nSome ideas:\n\npublic void testIsNullAccountAssigned();\npublic void testIsAccountAssignedNullAccount();\npublic void testWeCanHandleNullAccounts();\n\nNotice the last one talks more about the feature you&#39;re testing, and not the \nmethod you&#39;re testing. This gives you more freedom to change the \nimplementation of the feature. Trust me: that&#39;s something you desperately \nwant; otherwise, refactoring is awfully slow.\n\nJBR.\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nGet your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com/intl.asp\n\n\n",
