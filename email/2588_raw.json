Now, I&#39;ve done this\na\nbunch of times and JUnit is there to select as a library. The first time\nyou\ndo this, you may have to pick &quot;Add...&quot; and then click on the &quot;New...&quot;,\nfill\nout the form and click on the &quot;Add&quot; button to select the junit.jar file\nfor\nthe library path.\n\nAs others have noted, you then run the test by selecting the menu for\nProject -&gt; Project Properties, and then click on the Run tab. Under the\napplication tab, you&#39;ll see text that says &quot;Main Class:&quot; and a &quot;...&quot;\nbutton.\nClick on the &quot;...&quot; button and select one of the JUnit TestRunner entries\nunder Junit (for example - junit -&gt; swingui -&gt; TestRunner). Then under\nthe &quot;Application Parameters&quot; field enter in the fully qualified name to\nyour class that contains the top level test suite (or the test or suite\nyou want to run). For example, I just did\njdepend.framework.JDependTestSuite\nfor the JDepend program that Mike Clark publishes (www.clarkware.com).\n\nUnder the &quot;VM parameters&quot; field, you may want to enter &quot;-classic&quot;. I\nfound\nout from some kind sole, after some frustrating runs, that without this\nflag running under debug, breakpoints would only be &quot;seen&quot; the first\ntime\nthey are encountered. So if you had a break in a method that was called\n10\ntimes, you&#39;d only see the debugger break the first time you hit that\nbreakpoint.\nTurning on the &quot;classic&quot; options allows this to work as expected. I\nthink,\nand I may be wrong, that it was something with JIT or some optimization\nthat\n1.3 had and it causes problems with JBuilder. The &quot;classic&quot; option puts\nit\nin 1.2 mode, from what I gather.\n\nHope that helps...and that I didn&#39;t forget anything!\n\n \nPCM (Paul Michali)\n\nCarrier Voice Gateway Business Unit (CVGBU)\nCisco Systems, Inc.\n250 Apollo Drive\nChelmsford, MA 01824\n\nPhone : (800) 572-6771 x 45817  (978) 244-5817 [direct]\nPaging: (800) 365-4578 [voice]  pcm@...
