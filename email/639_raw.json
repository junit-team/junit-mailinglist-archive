Take a peek at the source code\nfor HttpServlet and you will find that you really don&#39;t have to overwrite the\nservice method for servlets that subclass HttpServlet. You will notice that the\nservice method in HttpServlet handles the HTTP 1.1 calls done to it (POST, GET,\nDELETE,etc). That said if you want to test the outcome of you get() and post()\nthen use httpunit ( http://httpunit.sourceforge.net/ ) to test those methods.\nThe reason why is that conceptually you are actually doing functional testing\n(acceptance testing in XP parlance) on the servlet. \n\nFor testing the individual methods of the servlet then use j2eeunit. This way\nyou are assured that the environment that contains your servlet is the\nappropiate one this means that all calls to methods that may have some unknown\ndependency with the servlet container will be appropiately enforced. I would\nrecommend starting with the public methods that return a value. This is an easy\nof mastering j2eeunit. Assert that your values returned are not null and that\nthey are what you expect from the method. Remember to properly set any\nparameters in the request so as to make sure that the servlet is in the\nappropiate state when you test.\n\nIf you want to do unit testing on the private methods then you will run into\nproblems since the family of junit pacakges and extensions can only easily\naccess public methods OR protected method IF the testCase is in the same\npackage as the class to test. There are other ways of testing private methods\nlike using inner classes but for now the fastest and easiest way is to convert\nthe private methods to protected and write the test for them.\n\nStart here. You will soon be asking yourself other questions about unit testing\nbut if you do the above then you should be ready to start thinking about\nrefactoring this class and you will be able to start thinking of the answers to\nthe questions that will come up. \n\nCaveat : write test, write code, run test, repeat.\n\nHappy hacking\n\n-H\n\n\n\n--- selena su &lt;selena.su@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Dear Experts:\n&gt;        As attached is my Java Servlet source file. I really have no idea\n&gt; how to go about to test my HttpDatabaseServlet.java ? ;(. Shall i use\n&gt; J2EEUnit or normal JUnit ? Since it&#39;s a normal without any request and\n&gt; response, so i will use JUnit to test it ?\n&gt;         One more question,  any ideas of writing the test cases for this\n&gt; class.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
