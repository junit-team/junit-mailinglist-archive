I love it and I realy wouldn&#39;t know where to start coding if I<br/>\ndidn&#39;t have my test first.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I started java and test first I loved to see the green bar. A good way<br/>\nto end the day was to see that green bar (I mainly used the GUI version<br/>\nthen). Going home (or to another task) with all tests running 100% was a<br/>\nrealy good feeling.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs time has gone, I&#39;ve interestingly found that going home with a few<br/>\nfailing tests shortly after having had all tests pass is an even bester way<br/>\nto end the day. &quot;Picking-up-time&quot; is much shorter when I arrive in the<br/>\nmorning or when I pick up the project after having worked on something else<br/>\nfor a while. There is no need to take notes to avoid the &quot;where did I get<br/>\nto&quot;. The failing tests take my thoughts right to the place they were when I<br/>\nleft off. I even find that when I do this I better &quot;let go&quot; of my project<br/>\nwhen I&#39;m not working on it.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo my tip, end the day in fresh red.<br/>\n<br/>\nMorten</div>",
