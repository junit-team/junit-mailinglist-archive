The arbitrary depth and ability to create\ncustom TestSuites and insert TestDecorators made writing runners difficult,\nespecially re-run. Instead you now pass a flat array of test classes to\nJUnitCore to run a suite of tests. The RunListener doesn&#39;t currently provide\nnotification when one of those classes starts and stops. I can imagine such\nnotification might be useful, but I don&#39;t want to put it in without more\njustification than that. Can you distill your wishes into a test case?\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nKent Beck\nThree Rivers Institute \n\n&gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; From: junit@yahoogroups.com [mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com] On \n&gt; Behalf Of James Abley\n&gt; Sent: Thursday, October 13, 2005 1:08 PM\n&gt; To: junit@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Subject: Re: [junit] Test Suites in HTML output\n&gt; \n&gt; On 12/10/05, Kent Beck &lt;kentb@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  James,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The current design provides testRunStarted(int count) and\n&gt; &gt; testRunFinished(Runner runner) notification to \n&gt; TestListeners. Is this\n&gt; &gt; sufficient for your purposes or do you need to be notified \n&gt; when a class&#39;\n&gt; &gt; tests are about to be run and have finished running?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Sincerely yours,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Kent Beck\n&gt; &gt; Three Rivers Institute\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Hi Kent,\n&gt; \n&gt; That sounds promising, so I&#39;ll pull my finger out and take a \n&gt; more thorough\n&gt; look at the JUnit 4 source and Java 5 stuff this weekend and \n&gt; try to get a\n&gt; feel for it.\n&gt; \n&gt; My use case for JUnit 3 was to be notified when a TestSuite that I had\n&gt; created, rather than an implicit one that JUnit creates for \n&gt; you, was about\n&gt; to start processing and had finished processing. This nicely \n&gt; let me capture\n&gt; a hierarchical view of all the TestSuites that had run. I \n&gt; ended up modifying\n&gt; my TestRunner, since I had constant known case of always \n&gt; having the same\n&gt; level of nesting for my constructed TestSuites.\n&gt; \n&gt; A quick scan of the Version4 branch found the the note in the \n&gt; to-do.txt file\n&gt; about meeting the needs of runner developers! I appreciate \n&gt; that writing a\n&gt; TestRunner like this is a somewhat specialized activity \n&gt; versus everyday use,\n&gt; but was wondering if there has been any provision in JUnit 4 \n&gt; for authors of\n&gt; TestRunners - could you provide any more detail about \n&gt; envisaged use cases?\n&gt; \n&gt; James\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ------------------------ Yahoo!
