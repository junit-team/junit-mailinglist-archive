No - therefore we do not need<br/>\n&gt; &gt;to test them. Errors within private methods will become apparent from<br/>\n&gt; &gt;testing the other interfaces.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Undoubtably that&#39;s true. But then if we are accepting that testing<br/>\n&gt; public/friendly/protected methods adecuately test these methods, why not go<br/>\n&gt; one step beyond and say that black box testing is all we need? It seems to<br/>\n&gt; me that testing private methods is as useful and valid as testing<br/>\n&gt; non-private ones, just at a different level of granularity.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>As a specific example, say I&#39;ve got some computation that involves a fairly<br/>\nhairy algorithm in one place.  I probably want to encapsulate that algorithm<br/>\ninto its own method so, e.g., I can Substitute in a new Algorithm later when<br/>\nsomeone points out that I (again) made the problem a lot harder than it needed<br/>\nto be.  I may well want to make that method private, though, as its existence<br/>\nor signature could reveal more about the internals of my class than I&#39;d like;<br/>\nit might, e.g., have an argument that refers to a component of some (private)<br/>\nfield.<br/>\n<br/>\nPresumably I would be _especially_ interested in testing such a method given<br/>\nthat it represents a non-trivial algorithm.  If I&#39;m forced to only test it<br/>\nindirectly then the tests of the public methods are likely to be harder to<br/>\nwrite and may depend in weird ways on this (hidden) implementation decision.<br/>\n<br/>\nI find that one of the (many) advantages of breaking things down into little<br/>\nmethods is that writing the tests is both less difficult and less<br/>\n(psychologically) daunting.  Big methods with complex behaviors are a pain to<br/>\ntest because there&#39;s so much _thinking_ involved in figuring out appropriate<br/>\nboundary conditions, blah, blah, blah, while little methods are usually much<br/>\neasier to test just because they&#39;re easier to understand.  The flipside,<br/>\nthough, is (as has been mentioned before) I don&#39;t want the creation of these<br/>\nlittle (sub)methods to make my public class interface (and consequently my<br/>\npublic obligations) bigger and more complex.  Thus I almost always make these<br/>\nnew little methods private initially, and only change them to protected or<br/>\npublic later when some clear need arises.  (As others have noted, this is<br/>\nessentially an application of YAGNI.)<br/>\n<br/>\n    Nic</div>",
