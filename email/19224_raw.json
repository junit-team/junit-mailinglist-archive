I have put an example below. Why is the\n&gt;  &gt; constructor, and not just setup(), called many times? Shouldn&#39;t it be that\n&gt;  &gt; only setup is called once for each test? I&#39;ve used both ant and eclipse to\n&gt;  &gt; run the test case. I&#39;m a little fuzzy on how this is even possible.\n&gt;\n&gt;  Although JUnit invokes each test it in its own instance of TestCase, it\n&gt;  reserves the right to pool instances if it wanted to. NUnit, for\n&gt;  example, pools instances of the test case class, but respects the\n&gt;  contract for, in its case, the [SetUp] and [TearDown] labels.\n&gt;\n&gt;  The goal of running each test in its own instance is test isolation. If\n&gt;  the tests are separate objects, there&#39;s no chance of an uninitialized\n&gt;  field corrupting a future test.\n\nWhat is the distinction between setup() and the constructor?  They\nboth seem to provide the same functionality (they are both called anew\nbefore every test method)?\n\n\n\nAdrian\n\n",
