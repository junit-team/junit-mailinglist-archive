ISP says clients should only have a\n&gt; source code dependency upon interfaces that they use. J.B. is\n&gt; suggesting taking private methods (which have only one client\n&gt; - the class itself) and putting them in another class - where\n&gt; they may or may not have more clients.\n\nAs I understand it, he was suggesting something else in the post I\nreplied to. Namely making the method public without moving it, but\nextracting an interface for the client which doesn&#39;t contain the\nformerly private method. ISP, so it seems to me.\n\nRegards, Ilja\n\n\n",
