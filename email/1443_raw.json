I have decided\nto go for the seperate directory structure. The last\noption about embedding the tests in the class may make\nthe code basedifficult to manage. You will have to\nhave all of the testing resources in your classpath on\nproduction etc which does not make much sense. There\nis a tool called ANT which we will be using to manage\nthe codebase. You can get to build all the code run\nthe tests and deploy to production all in one script.\nI really like Together J but I have started using\nnetbeans. It&#39;s totally free which my boss likes alot.\nThe module for junit in that will create a test class\nfor each class that contains empty test methods.  I am\nalso considering a test sub directory in each package\ninstead. I think the avoiding deployment of the tests\nto production makes sense.\n\nCheers\n\nDavid\n\n\n\n--- Steven Webster &lt;steven.webster@...&gt;\nwrote:\n&gt; I&#39;ve inherited a huge codebase which I&#39;ll be taking\n&gt; over development for; as soon as\n&gt; possible, I want to put skeletal JUnit tests in\n&gt; place for every class; as I perform\n&gt; refactorings, and as I introduce new functionality,\n&gt; my intention is to first flesh out\n&gt; JUnit tests, before adding feature/refactoring.\n&gt;\n&gt; This raises several questions, most of all related\n&gt; to what are the best practices\n&gt; for keeping Unit Tests alongside code.\n&gt;\n&gt; Options as I see them:\n&gt;\n&gt; 1.    A separate directory tree with a root note of\n&gt; test, the package structure of\n&gt;       which reflects that of the codebase; keep the\n&gt; tests completely isolated from\n&gt;       production code, the downside being that if I\n&gt; refactor code around packages,\n&gt;       I have to remember to move tests as well;\n&gt; also, removes my ability to test\n&gt;       private and protected methods..\n&gt;\n&gt; 2.    A &#39;test&#39; directory in each package of the\n&gt; codebase, containing TestXXXX\n&gt;       classes; with a TestXXXX class for each XXXX\n&gt; class in the package above.\n&gt;       Again, can&#39;t test public/protected methods,\n&gt; and a little extra work is\n&gt;       required to remove tests from production code,\n&gt; but not that much.\n&gt;\n&gt; 3.    Actually make each class in the production\n&gt; code it&#39;s own test, ie put the\n&gt;       JUnit testing code in the class itself.  This\n&gt; gives me access to protected\n&gt;       and private methods, AND makes it easy to\n&gt; refactor and move tests around.\n&gt;       Another upside is that the JUnit plugin for\n&gt; Together UML will create all\n&gt;       these test skeletons for me in this manner.\n&gt; Downside (and I see it as a\n&gt;       pretty big downside) is that my JUnit tests\n&gt; are all but impossible to remove\n&gt;       from my production code.\n&gt;\n&gt; Has anyone got any thoughts on this problem ?\n&gt; Anyone been in a similar\n&gt; situation, and got suggestions they could offer ?\n&gt;\n&gt; Cheers,\n&gt;\n&gt; Steven\n&gt;\n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nGet personalized email addresses from Yahoo!
