Here is the basic\n&gt; thought:\n[snip]\n\nI think this post is pretty offtopic.  But, you used the word &quot;Agile,&quot; so, I\nread it and am replying.\n\nInteresting article thoughts.  Also quite &quot;high level&quot; and speculative,\nwhich made me wonder about some facts.\n\nFor instance, what&#39;s the typical salary for a senior or principal developer\nin India?  How much is their salary affected by whether that engineer is\nworking out of Bombay or a suburb or some small city?  Just curious what the\nCIOs are up against in their decision process -- how much money can be saved\non a project by outsourcing some of the work?  What are the most successful\nways to leverage outsourcing help?\n\nHow much is outsourcing the decision of a CIO?  I&#39;ve seen outsourcing\nproposed and advocated at the department Director and VP level, though the\nCIO is usually involved to approve any large IT/Dev expenditure.  Of course\nwith job title inflation the past few years, there are lots of &quot;CIOs&quot; of\nlittle start-ups too.  Anyway, is this typically a decision the CIO would\nreally dig into?  Or is it a lower level decision just needing financial\napproval at the higher level?\n\nI&#39;m curious why we can&#39;t get more U.S. people employed in the computer\nprofessions.  Every place I&#39;ve worked in the past few years (including a\ncouple big time software companies) has had several H1 Visa employees,\nusually Indian or Chinese.  I&#39;ve found that these folks vary in their\nexperience and technical expertise as much as anyone else I&#39;ve worked with.\n\nFinally, there&#39;s the notion of Agile CIO, which is intriguing.  But is it\njust b.s.?  I mean, CIOs are high level managers, not developers.  How do\nyou presume to apply agile methods at the CIO level in more than tenuous\nanalogies?  I think it quite possible the whole notion of CIO is contra\nagile methodology.\n\nScott Stirling\n\n\n\n",
