Based on the message returned my<br/>\n&gt;  testcase will pass or fail.<br/>\n&gt;  Additionally I have to have multiple testcases that will send messages<br/>\n&gt;  using the same connection. Note that the server maintains a session<br/>\n&gt;  information on the client connection. <br/>\n&gt;  How do i share this session information(connection + related crap)<br/>\n&gt;  across testcases, so that i can execute a sequence of testcases which<br/>\n&gt;  will all use the same connection. One mechanism i thought of was<br/>\n&gt;  extending a testcase that will contain the connection and use it as a<br/>\n&gt;  fixture, all testcases will call that as a fixture but how do i shared<br/>\n&gt;  the connection from the fixture to other testcases which them selves<br/>\n&gt;  need to send messages?<br/>\n&gt;  Thanks<br/>\n&gt;  Akhil Srinivasan<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;m not sure this is a good way to go - you&#39;re losing test isolation<br/>\nso that you will potentially experience multiple failures if a single<br/>\nthing is wrong and causes a knock-on effect. Using a Mock Object<br/>\napproach would seem to be preferred.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat are you trying to test here  - it sounds like it&#39;s acceptance<br/>\ntesting of the server? If so, then why can&#39;t you extract tests which<br/>\nverify the behaviour of the server according to your use cases? If<br/>\nyou&#39;re testing that sessions are correctly associated with a given<br/>\nclient, then I would say that is a separate test.<br/>\n<br/>\nJames</div>",
