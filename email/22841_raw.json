The current system uses a Maven2 buildsystem.=\r\n\n\n\nThe current deficiency (not in junit, but tooling) is not from a develop=\r\ner running the unit tests, it&#39;s from a non-code-developer (i.e. a database =\r\nperson who works with (M$) tools like Query Analyzers/Enterprise managers) =\r\nverifying their database changes did not impact the current junits without =\r\nneeding a code-developer to &#39;babysit&#39; watching the unit tests.\n\nThe CI serv=\r\ner would be perfect...if the sql code changes were commited to source contr=\r\nol at the same time the TEST database instance was updated, but no source c=\r\nontrol is committed to trigger the unit tests (i.e. database changes not in=\r\n source control, or in a different source control system...and generally yo=\r\nu try not to commit code until local unit tests pass).  I will think about =\r\nthis one more though as a talking point to move in that direction.\n\n\nUntil =\r\nthen, the challenge is still the &#39;non-developer&#39; to be able to invoke runni=\r\nng the unit tests through a GUI they (a person familiar with M$ GUI screens=\r\n) can run and understand.  Command-line/console approaches are difficult to=\r\n get acceptance for external users who are used to their GUI screens :-(\n\n\n=\r\n\n\n\n--- In junit@yahoogroups.com, Malte Finsterwalder &lt;malte@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n I think David Staff&#39;s idea with an integrations server is probably the\n&gt; b=\r\nest way to go.\n&gt; \n&gt; Other than that, I don&#39;t see the problem. Why not just =\r\nrun JUnit as a\n&gt; console application / Ant Build or alike?\n&gt; If you want, y=\r\nou can wrap it in a batch-file or something to make it\n&gt; even easier to sta=\r\nrt.\n&gt; \n&gt; Why is this situation not to your satisfaction?\n&gt; \n&gt; Greetings,\n&gt; =\r\n   Malte\n&gt;\n\n\n\n",
