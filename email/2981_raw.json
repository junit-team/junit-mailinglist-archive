When I run under \njunit, it can&#39;t find some org.xml classes.  When I run standalone I \nhave no problems.\n\nIf anyone knows why, I&#39;d love to find out.\n\n--- In junit@y..., Anthony  Pereira &lt;apereira@3...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Hi, \n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m not sure whether this is the place to submit what I&#39;m just \ngoing to\n&gt; write about, if not please do point me in the right direction, \ncheers.\n&gt; \n&gt; I came across a rather bizzare scenario, today using the\n&gt; junit.swingui.TestRunner in a java 1.4beta2 environment. In some of \nmy code,\n&gt; I reference classes in org.w3c.dom and org.apache.crimson. Now, as \nsoon as\n&gt; junit came across classes from these packages, it threw class not \nfound\n&gt; exceptions. Please note that this doesn&#39;t happen in the the textui \nnor my\n&gt; own testing classes, since they are both in the classpath.\n&gt; \n&gt; org.w3c.dom specifically is in the rt.jar\n&gt; org.apache.crimson is a separate jar, which is on my classpath\n&gt; \n&gt; After a bit of digging around in the source code, specifically in \nthe\n&gt; TestCaseClassLoader, I found out about the \njunit&#92;runner&#92;exclude.properties\n&gt; file. When I added these package names to that file, things seemed \nok, and\n&gt; those exceptions didn&#39;t take place.\n&gt; \n&gt; What confused me was why it didn&#39;t find the classes, even though \nthey was on\n&gt; my classpath, especially the org.w3c ones which are in the rt.jar \n(with\n&gt; 1.4). Furthermore, this was only a problem when using the swingui, \nwith the\n&gt; textui, it was fine.\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;ve got it working now that I put those details in the \nexclude.properties\n&gt; file. Is this perhaps a issue with using 1.4?\n&gt; \n&gt; Any comments or explainations?\n&gt; Thanks\n&gt; Anthony\n\n\n",
