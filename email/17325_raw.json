I jumped to my guns\ntoo quickly.\n\n\nOn =\r\n8/7/06, Joakim Ohlrogge &lt;joakim.ohlrogge@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Hi C=E9dric,\n=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; FYI, a few more reactions and articles on the same topic.  It looks l=\r\nike\n&gt; &gt;  most of the Java and Ruby communities (last link) are typically us=\r\ning a\n&gt; &gt;  small portion of TDD and a majority of regular testing, which ma=\r\ntches my\n&gt; &gt;  experience.\n&gt;\n&gt; I don&#39;t think anyone ever disagreed that &quot;reg=\r\nular testing&quot; interpreted\n&gt; to mean automated acceptance testing and unit t=\r\nesting is not done to\n&gt; the extent we would like to see on this list. I don=\r\n&#39;t think anyone\n&gt; needs to be convinced about this, this is a known fact, o=\r\nne that a lot\n&gt; of us believe should change. It is in the conclusions that =\r\ncan be\n&gt; derived from that where opinions differ. You seem to say that sinc=\r\ne\n&gt; most software is not &quot;regularly tested&quot; and most software works great\n&gt;=\r\n you can abviously do perfectly well without &quot;regular testing&quot;.\n&gt;\n&gt; Myself =\r\nand others have argued that most software can work better and\n&gt; that our ac=\r\nceptance for errors is too high. David Saff also made an\n&gt; interesting comm=\r\nent about all the software we don&#39;t see, the software\n&gt; we don&#39;t use and th=\r\ne software that is never released. I think it is\n&gt; natural that popular sof=\r\ntware used by many works great, or it\n&gt; wouldn&#39;&#39;t be popular. Popular softw=\r\nare can also deferr some testing to\n&gt; their &quot;beta&quot;-testers and &quot;get away wi=\r\nth it&quot;. But that is just a small\n&gt; fraction of all the software written.\n&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; I personally think that you are way wrong that there is code that is\n&gt; ot=\r\n tested and works. I think that all software out there is tested,\n&gt; meaning=\r\n some effort has been made to ensure that it works. There are\n&gt; hard ways a=\r\nnd easy ways to test software. The easy way (I think it is\n&gt; automated test=\r\ning) is the most reliable while the hard way requires\n&gt; some guesswork and =\r\npredictions coupled with manual effort.\n&gt;\n&gt; I followed the first link and g=\r\not a little bit upset by one of your\n&gt; transcriptions of a supposedly retho=\r\nrical answer:\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;One response to the question suggests that there are onl=\r\ny two types\n&gt; of code: Code that is tested and works and code that is not t=\r\nested and\n&gt; doesn&#39;t work. Cedric&#39;s take on the subject is that there are wa=\r\nys of\n&gt; knowing that your code is working without actually testing it. So w=\r\ne\n&gt; should also include a third category: Code that is not tested and\n&gt; wor=\r\nks.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; That was your subjective interpretation of what Robert C Martin wr=\r\note.\n&gt; When you asked for clarification you asked:\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;You seem to imply t=\r\nhat there are only two kinds of code:\n&gt;\n&gt;  - Code that is tested and works\n=\r\n&gt;  - Code that is not tested and doesn&#39;t work\n&gt;\n&gt; There is actually somethi=\r\nng in the middle: it&#39;s called &quot;Code that\n&gt; is not\n&gt; tested but that works&quot;.=\r\n&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; That was the interpretation you used in the blog-entry.\n&gt; The reply c=\r\name:\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;The two kinds of code are:\n&gt;\n&gt; - Code you have tested, and you kn=\r\now works to the best of your\n&gt; ability to determine.\n&gt; - Code you have not =\r\ntested and don&#39;t know if it works.\n&gt;\n&gt; If you haven&#39;t tested the code, you =\r\ndon&#39;t know that it works. If you\n&gt; HAVE tested the code then you know that =\r\nit passes your tests.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Why didn&#39;t you just post the statement as it w=\r\nas written instead of\n&gt; your subjective interpretation? Your interpretation=\r\n sure has more\n&gt; punch that the real thing but it is obviously  not what th=\r\ne author\n&gt; meant.\n&gt;\n&gt; I really admire you taking a stand in this discussion=\r\n and in this\n&gt; forum. A lot of really good discussion has come out of it an=\r\nd not many\n&gt; are so brave as you are to go against the flow on a board like=\r\n this.\n&gt; But when you post subjective interpretaions like the one above you=\r\n\n&gt; loose credibility, atleast with me. And I think that is a shame\n&gt; becaus=\r\ne you obviously have a message that you want to get through\n&gt; with. I think=\r\n your opinions deserves to be listened to and evaluated.\n&gt;\n&gt; I didn&#39;t read =\r\nthe rest of the links or the comments, perhaps something\n&gt; more interesting=\r\n or would have com up there.\n&gt;\n&gt; Just one mans opinion\n&gt; /J\n&gt;\n\n",
