Rainsberger\n  Sent: Thursday, January 19, 2006 9:13 PM\n  To: junit@yahoogroups.com\n  Subject: Re: [junit] On Requests and Plans\n\n\n  David Saff wrote:\n\n  &gt; However, if the only way to know the number of lines in this\n  &gt; hypothetical data file was to read it, this requirement would force\n  &gt; either two passes through the file, or storing the whole file in\n  &gt; memory.  Do you think this would be a hangup often in scenarios you&#39;ve\n  &gt; seen?  How did you solve such problems in JUnit 3?\n\n  As far as I can tell from the community, they didn&#39;t. (I never\n  personally dealt with the problem.) That was one thing they didn&#39;t like\n  about JUnit: running out of memory when constructing test suites.\n\n  &gt; Thanks for the excellent questions--this is exactly what we were looking\n  &gt; for.\n\n  You&#39;re welcome.\n  --\n  J.
