That said,<br/>\n&gt; it&#39;s likely to be at least a month or two before there&#39;s a finalized<br/>\n&gt; release that incorporates this.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Oh. That&#39;s a faster timeframe than I was expecting.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Oh, I would also consider it aggressive as a target.  I was just pointing<br/>\nout that even the best-case scenario of getting code into JUnit would be an<br/>\norder of magnitude or two higher latency and effort than improving the<br/>\ndocumentation to point to existing, already-working solutions, so we should<br/>\nprioritize the doc upgrade.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; In the meantime, would it make sense to add a section to the wiki that<br/>\n&gt; explains how someone can use RuntimeSuite and the existing features of<br/>\n&gt; JUnit to get what Mark&#39;s team originally wanted in<br/>\n&gt; Eclipse/maven/command-line/etc?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I developed RuntimeSuite at a client who was just starting to use Maven.<br/>\n&gt; We invoked the suite by configuring surefire like this:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; path/to/my/SuiteClass.java<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; You could generalize that by using a property instead of naming a specific<br/>\n&gt; class.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; That&#39;s the extent of my understanding of how to use RuntimeSuite with<br/>\n&gt; Maven.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; So does that (admittedly minimal) guidance suffice for Maven?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I have no idea what&#39;s required to integrate anything with Eclipse (or<br/>\n&gt; IntelliJ IDEA).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; At my client, we weren&#39;t doing anything trickier than configuring Maven to<br/>\n&gt; run our suite class. We never, for example, used properties or command line<br/>\n&gt; args to configure finders and filters. In fact, none of the finders and<br/>\n&gt; filters built into RuntimeSuite were configurable at runtime. Everything<br/>\n&gt; they know, they know at compile time.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; That said, people /could/ implement their own finders and filters,<br/>\n&gt; configurable at runtime in whatever way suits them. Because finders and<br/>\n&gt; filters are implemented as rules, you can hand their constructors any<br/>\n&gt; configuration options you desire, as long as you know how to get the<br/>\n&gt; options to the constructors. (A simple matter of programming?)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; The hope would be that this would move at least a few teams from &quot;I give<br/>\n&gt; up&quot; to &quot;I&#39;m glad this will get easier, but at least we&#39;re up and running&quot;.<br/>\n&gt; In the process of generating it, we might also unearth some corner cases<br/>\n&gt; that would nice to know before baking things in (for example, will our<br/>\n&gt; recommended Eclipse solution work in the presence of tests loaded into OSGi<br/>\n&gt; containers?)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I am entirely ignorant of OSGI.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>And it&#39;s only a shady memory to me, populated by phantoms and cold<br/>\nspectres. Which is why it would be good to try to get people who care about<br/>\nit to beta-test our documentation before there&#39;s hundreds of lines of code<br/>\nbehind it.  :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n   David Saff<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; Dale<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --<br/>\n&gt; Dale Emery<br/>\n&gt; Consultant to software teams and leaders<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://dhemery.com\">http://dhemery.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",
