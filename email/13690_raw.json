My tests are failures\n&gt; , the configuration is.\n&gt; \n&gt; I have always found the difference between ERROR and\n&gt; FAILURE confusing and I bet that except for JUnit experts\n&gt; such as yourself, nobody can really explain it.  \n\nFrom the JUnit cookbook:\n\n&quot;In the case of an unsuccessful test JUnit reports the\nfailed tests in a list at the bottom. JUnit distinguishes\nbetween failures and errors. A failure is anticipated and\nchecked for with assertions. Errors are unanticipated\nproblems like an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException. The\nfollowing figure shows an example of a failed test.&quot;\n\nIt doesn&#39;t get much clear than that... now, I know that\npeople will rather post questions to a mailing list than\nread the doco, but at least it is in there.\n\n&gt; Assuming that it&#39;s important to know whether a test failed\n&gt; because of an assert of an unexpected exception (a dubious\n&gt; proposition in the first place since when a test fails,\n&gt; you are going to check out the stack trace anyway and find\n&gt; out exactly where it failed), it would certainly have been\n&gt; better to name them differently.\n\nThe point of the difference, Cedric, is that when you come\nin and find that 101 tests didn&#39;t pass, you should start\nwith the failing tests before going on to the error tests.\n\nThe same goes if you come in and find that 101 tests didn&#39;t\npass because 100 were skipped - you&#39;d presumably start with\nthe failing one first. :)\n\nYes, these are habits to develop, but they aren&#39;t hard\nhabits to develop.\n\nRobert.\n\n",
