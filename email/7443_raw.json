Also, what is done about the &#39;bloat&#39; that is added \n&gt; to classes by test code?  (mainly when inner classes are used to \n&gt; facilitate testing).  I don&#39;t care about it in the development \n&gt; environment, but if my application is to be downloaded and there are \n&gt; megabytes of embedded test code it can become an issue.  (So far my \n&gt; code is a small fraction of the download, so this isn&#39;t an issue - yet)\n\nMy experience is that when I get serious about testing existing code, I\nfind myself redesigning existing pieces to make them more easily\ntestable. I end up with a lot more classes, most of which are more\nfocused on their intent than the original. A great side-effect is that I\nam finding myself with a lot of reusable code that I did not know I had.\nI am not sure because I have not run any statistics, but I think my\ntotal number of lines of code generally decreases during this process. \n\n&gt; \n&gt; Another comment:\n&gt; I&#39;ve been trying to get started with the unit testing and have been \n&gt; encouraging other&#39;s in my company to try it too, but I can&#39;t get any \n&gt; buy-in. I&#39;m finding it difficult to get started so I don&#39;t really have \n&gt; a convincing argument for it other than &quot;I&#39;ve read that it is a great \n&gt; thing&quot; :), obviously if I can make it work for me it would help.   It&#39;s \n&gt; good to hear that others have had the same issues and have gotten past \n&gt; them.   The examples make it look so simple and easy...\n\nBeen there, done that. Most developers don&#39;t want to write tests because\nthey think testing is boring or has no value added to them (i.e. it does\nnot help them write code better or faster). I was in that camp for quite\na while. However, when I found myself writing acceptance tests and\nhaving them find bugs that should have been found earlier in the\ndevelopment cycle, I began to look for a &#39;better way&#39;. For me, using\nJUnit as an integral part of my software development process does allow\nme to write code that I am much more confident in. The examples do make\nit look simple and easy. In practice I find it pretty simple and easy to\nwrite tests, after the initial learning curve. I am by no means an\nexpert, having started doing serious work with JUnit just a couple of\nmonths ago. But the more I use it the better I like it.\n \n\n&gt; \n&gt; On Wednesday, April 2, 2003, at 12:46 AM, Levi Cook \n&gt; &lt;levicook@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; On Tuesday, April 1, 2003, at 02:07  PM, swpalmer2001 wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Or is this unit testing just a passing fad that is\n&gt; &gt;&gt; really nothing more than a bunch of hype?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; PS&gt; Despite your opening disclaimer this sounds a little like trolling\n&gt; &gt; :)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; Yes, it does (sorry).. My intention was to get a feel for how many \n&gt; people out there have been down this road and concluded that it wasn&#39;t \n&gt; all that it was promised to be.
