Remember that TDD is a\n/design/ activity, not a testing activity.  I am afraid that generated\nassertions would break the basic cycle feedback of TDD.\n\nI am not going to tell you not to do this project, but calling it TDD\nwould cause me to call into question your understanding of TDD.\n\nchet\n\nWednesday, December 27, 2006, 3:58:58 PM, you wrote:\n\n&gt; hmm, to be honest, I haven&#39;t had much experience with TDD or JUnit \n&gt; till I started on my honors project  about a couple of months ago. \n&gt; I&#39;ve done much research however and have written a small lab \n&gt; excercise using TDD.\n\n&gt; As for what makes me think its a good idea, well basically all the \n&gt; articles I read and the people I&#39;ve spoken to remark on two reasons \n&gt; why people do not pick up TDD, firstly being the test-first concept \n&gt; of it is difficult to grasp and secondly that they do not see the \n&gt; benefits in using it.\n\n&gt; Well Junit was designed to allow repeated testing and I figure if it \n&gt; could be further extended to generate the basic test cases it could \n&gt; save alot of time and effort on the tester&#39;s part.\n\n&gt; I mean from personal experience I thought it was hell of a tedious \n&gt; to generate all the assert statements usually needed to test a given \n&gt; unit of code i.e. a method. So I thought why not auto generate some \n&gt; test cases? I dont mean all of them since testing is creative \n&gt; work...but surely the basic few?\n\n&gt; Stressed,\n&gt; Jimm\n\n\n\n\n\n-- \nBest regards,\n chet                            mailto:lists@...\n\n\n",
