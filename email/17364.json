Or, that <br/>\nis only a theoretical existence, since you can&#39;t know such code exists, <br/>\nuntil you test it, even if only by using it.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf a person has time to test it manually, and he uses the tests as <br/>\nchange detectors (so he runs them more than once in his life), then he <br/>\nvery likely has time to automate at least some non-trivial subset of <br/>\nthose tests. Over time, he&#39;ll find that automating some of those tests <br/>\nup front is faster than running them manually any number of times.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I have observed is that the &quot;time problem&quot; is not a matter of &quot;I <br/>\ndon&#39;t have time to write the tests&quot;, but rather a matter of &quot;I don&#39;t <br/>\nhave time to learn how to write the tests&quot;. Those are two very different <br/>\nanimals. In that case, I concur with Bob, that &quot;senior guys&quot; are guys <br/>\nwho take time to learn; and conversely, you can&#39;t be a &quot;senior guy&quot; if <br/>\nyou don&#39;t take time to learn. (Note, that doesn&#39;t have to be project <br/>\ntime. It&#39;s often spare time for those senior guys.)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; It&#39;s a fairly common occurrence, in my experience, and the reason behind my<br/>\n&gt; comments earlier: if other circumstances warrant it, it&#39;s okay to write the<br/>\n&gt; code, ship it and write the tests later.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>If it doesn&#39;t have to work, that&#39;s fine.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Just use your judgment, that&#39;s why your employer is paying you.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I agree with this statement; however, &quot;judgment&quot; without information is <br/>\njust guessing.<br/>\n<br/>\nTake care.<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJ.
