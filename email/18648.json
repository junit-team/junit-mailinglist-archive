Is this the<br/>\ncase for you?<br/>\n<br/>\nIf so, what value does your &quot;QA&quot; find from these types of tests?<br/>\nAdditionally, if so, might it be a risky idea to run only select tests as<br/>\nopposed to the collective suite?<br/>\n<br/>\nIf not, being new to JUnit, it might be advisable for you to consider<br/>\nutilizing JUnit for this purpose. (And, in this case, there is certainly<br/>\nplenty of info available on this mailing list and even more in more formal<br/>\nprint that would be of great value to you)<br/>\n<br/>\nJust food for thought.  Cheers!..<br/>\n--MB<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",
