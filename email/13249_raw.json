Do not get carried away by\n&gt;  &gt; this example..I am trying to sample a similar one.. Assume\n&gt;  &gt; the following heirarchy structure..\n&gt;  &gt; BizDoc = Performs versions/history relation functions.\n&gt;  &gt; OrderDoc -&gt; BizDoc = Performs Order related functions.\n&gt;  &gt; RequestDoc -&gt; BizDoc = Performs Request related functions.\n&gt;  &gt; PurchaseOrder -&gt;OrderDoc = Performs PO specific functions.\n&gt;  &gt; Invoice -&gt; OrderDoc = Performs Invoice specific functions.\n&gt;  &gt; Shipment -&gt; Orderdoc = Performs Shipment specific functions.\n&gt;  &gt; Auction -&gt; RequestDoc = Performs auctions specific functions.\n&gt;  &gt; PurchaseRequest -&gt; RequestDoc = Performs PR specific functions.\n&gt;  \n&gt;  With all due respect, this hierarchy looks a little big to me. I would\n&gt; think\n&gt;  about using composition in some of those places. (Or aren&#39;t you actually\n&gt;  talking about inheritance here?)\n\nJAK: as I have mentioned this heirarchy is just a sample...in reality\nit could be even deeper.  Let us not question the design for testing..\n\n&gt;  &gt; I would prefer to organize my tests with a similar hierarchy\n&gt;  &gt; structure\n&gt;  \n&gt;  Why?\n&gt;  \n&gt;  &gt; Also I would like to initialise the objects needed in the\n&gt;  &gt; appropriate level for the childs to make use of them without doing\n&gt;  &gt; them again. \n&gt;  \n&gt;  I&#39;m not sure I understand this. Care to elaborate?\nhmm. There won&#39;t a limit to explain the situation.  I assume you\nunderstand the scenario i&#39;m trying to explain.  At different levels it\nlooks up and initializes the composite objects for that level. \nDerivatives uses them sometimes or overrides depending on their needs.\n\n&gt;  &gt; 1. Have a single parent without testXXX methods do the on\n&gt;  &gt; demand initialisation at the top level and all Uts inherit\n&gt;  &gt; from this single parent. And have Uts in a single level. In\n&gt;  &gt; the above case BizDocUt & PurchaseRequestUt will be in the\n&gt;  &gt; same level.  BizDocUt initialises some objects in the helpers\n&gt;  &gt; and make available for all Uts.  Or if PurchaseRequestUt is\n&gt;  &gt; run first it initialises first all Bizdoc objects so that\n&gt;  &gt; BizdocUt can run w/o initializing them again.\n&gt;  \n&gt;  So are you saying the Bizdoc objects are global to the tests? What does it\n&gt;  mean to &quot;initialize&quot; them? Where are the hold?\n&gt;  \nBizDoc is the System object and BizDocUt is Unit test class which\ntests the BizDoc operations/API. Here Parent(s) can have any name\nwhich extends TestCase and BizDocUt and other tests would inherit and\nuse them as just parents .  These parent(s) will not have testXXX\nmethods.\n&gt;  &gt; 2. Maintain the heirarchy of Ut and use the Test suite in all\n&gt;  &gt; Ut classes to add the child tests only.\n&gt;  \n&gt;  Sounds like unecessary work to me.\nThis is an alternative to override the default behavior of the jUnit\nwhich adds parents test also.  I agree this is painful but it is\nnecessary.\n&gt;  &gt; Guys - don&#39;t you feel this is a very common need for any OO\n&gt;  &gt; application.\n&gt;  \n&gt;  Frankly, no, I don&#39;t feel it is. It rather looks to me as if your design is\n&gt;  suboptimal, and that your testing problems are just a symptom of that. I\n&gt;  don&#39;t know enough to be sure, though.\n&gt;  \nSystem design is for meeting the requirement not meeting the testing\nrequirement.\nWhen we are writing test cases at the lower level (API testing) we\ncan&#39;t expect a seperate set of API for testing purpose only.\n\n&gt;  &gt; I am surprised JUnit doesn&#39;t provided this\n&gt;  &gt; flexibility directly.\n&gt;  \n&gt;  That&#39;s because the inventors of Junit, and many of it users, don&#39;t just\n&gt;  write unit tests to tests the system, but use writing tests as a *design*\n&gt;  technique. If they encounter a problem when trying to write Junit tests for\n&gt;  their system, they first think about what the system needed to look like to\n&gt;  not have those problems, and often find that refactoring it to that\n&gt;  direction improves the overall decoupling and flexibility.\n&gt;  \n&gt;  &gt; I have posted my requirement for\n&gt;  &gt; Logical flow of tests which is also good to have.  JUnit has these\n&gt;  &gt; missing.\n&gt;  \n&gt;  It can be added to Junit without a problem, it is flexible enough to allow\n&gt;  that. It&#39;s not at the core of Junit because many of its users actually\n&gt; think\n&gt;  that needing a &quot;Logical flow of tests&quot; is a thing that should be avoided.\n&gt;  \n&gt;  &gt; I can hack(override) into jUnit to support these but I do\n&gt;  &gt; not want to maintain this for every release.\n&gt;  \n&gt;  If you want, you can write a TestSuite implementation that uses reflection\n&gt;  to only call the test methods declared directly in a class (that is, not\n&gt; the\n&gt;  inherited ones). I think it would take me less than an hour to do so. In\n&gt;  years of using Junit, I never felt the need to do that, though.\n&gt;  \nI understand you have not encountered this before and that is the\nreason why I have explained a scenario which needs this.  It is not\nabout writing some code to override the behaviour, it is about\nmaintaining them..\n\n&gt;  &gt; JUnit folks..are you hearing...?\n&gt;  \n&gt;  Certainly. Are you, too? ;)\n\nThanks..I mean jUnit inventors in your language..:-)\n\n~JAK\n\n",
