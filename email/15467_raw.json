I decided to try unit testing.\n\nSo, I started with an obvious class and started to build the methods i \nthought it needed and the accompanying test class with methods that \ntested the respective methods of the class under test. As the code base \ngrew I found refactoring quite a burden. Perhaps I had my intial design \nincorrect.\n\nThen i decided to try TDD. Wow! Suddenly i was writing code to satisfy \nmy tests (a client) and things seemed a lot more natural. Productivity \nincreased and i built only what i needed. I think this is how \ndevelopment should happen (I have since hit a wall with testing \nnon-POJOs that I am still grappling with).\n\nHowever, the tests that result from TDD are NOT unti tests. They are \nactually quite high-level. I found dropping out of TDD into unit testing \nquite hard and unnatural. Even though the resulting tests are important \nto have, i couldn&#39;t help feeling that by not writing the lower-level \nunit tests (against say a private method) I was not doing the right thing.\n\nDoes anyone understand what I mean? Have i misunderstood unit testing \nand TDD?\n\nThanks\n\nRakesh\n\n",
