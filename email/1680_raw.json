What exactly could happen if you put back a Connection to\n&gt; your pool without for instance closing a statement created with this\n&gt; Connection ?\n&gt; In the beginning of my programming &#39;career&#39; I wrote lots of code never\n&gt; worrying about those things, and I never noticed anything bad\n&gt; happening....\n&gt; I&#39;m still quite a bit of a newbie but now I close my stuff, yet I don&#39;t\n&gt; really know why...\n&gt;\n&gt; /jan\n&gt;\n&gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; From: Rob Swan [mailto:rob.swan@...]\n&gt; Sent: 25. juni 2001 09:17\n&gt; To: junit@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Subject: RE: [junit] Testing Connection Pools\n&gt;\n&gt; It depends on too many things to give a specific answer here but\n&gt; as a general rule I would always try to have my runtime release\n&gt; code check for the &#39;cleanness&#39; of all connections, even if I had\n&gt; to write a specific class with functionality for this.\n&gt; I&#39;d then hammer these with unit test cases to make sure they will\n&gt; always gurantee clean conncections.\n&gt; I&#39;m not very up on JDBC. You may have to wrap JDBC in your own\n&gt; shell to provide the integrity checking.\n&gt;\n&gt; Noboddy should need reminding that whatever it costs, a clean\n&gt; database is worth the pain.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; From: Jim Cheesman [mailto:jchees@...]\n&gt; Sent: 22 June 2001 09:58\n&gt; To: junit@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Subject: RE: [junit] Testing Connection Pools\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;For software quality two of the most important things to test for\n&gt; &gt;(if you can) are:\n&gt; &gt;1. Connections are &#39;clean&#39; when you put them back in the pool.\n&gt; &gt;The next piece of code to use the connection should be able to\n&gt; &gt;do so without fear of picking up a bad connection or one which\n&gt; &gt;wasn&#39;t tidied up properly by the last user.\n&gt;\n&gt; Just out of interest, (and getting a little OT) is there any way to\n&gt; check\n&gt; (within the code - not as a unit test) that the connection is &quot;clean&quot; -\n&gt; ie\n&gt; ResultSets, statements closed etc.?\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Jim\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; --\n&gt;\n&gt;                            *   Jim Cheesman   *\n&gt;              Trabajo:\n&gt; jchees@... - (34)(91) 724 9200 x 2360\n&gt;               Exaggeration is not\n&gt; all it&#39;s cracked up to be.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
