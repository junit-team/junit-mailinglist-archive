Customized based\non each method is what I&#39;m looking for... In fact, I have already\nre-written the main method to handle a different RunListener, but I\nwould be happy to hear about other solutions, since I have an xml files\nwith what arguments to read for each test in the test program and I\nwould rather reading the option whether to run it at the same place to\nsave parsing the file twice.\n\n \n\nA side question: since I have a customized RunListener to write\npass/fail information to a log file, is there a way for me to pass this\ninfo back into a textarea in my JFrame of my UI Java test program also?\n(ie, how to convert a textare into a PrintStream to pass back to the\nRunListener).\n\n \n\nThanks in advance,\n\n \n\nVietchau\n\n \n\n________________________________\n\nFrom: junit@yahoogroups.com [mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com] On Behalf Of\nDavid Saff\nSent: Thursday, December 14, 2006 11:06 AM\nTo: junit@yahoogroups.com\nSubject: Re: [junit] how to skip a test at runtime\n\n \n\nVietchau,\n\nThere are a couple of options. First, you can run individual methods\nlike this:\n\npublic static void main(String... args) {\nnew JUnitCore().run(Request.method(MyClass.class,\n&quot;selectedMethodName&quot;));\n}\n\nor, if you want more fine-grained control, you can use a Filter:\n\npublic static void main(String... args) {\nnew JUnitCore().run(Request.aClass(MyClass.class).filterWith(new\nMyFilter()));\n}\n\nI take from your post that you&#39;ll want to process the args passed in\nto figure out the methods that should or shouldn&#39;t be run. Let me\nknow if writing your own main application meets your requirements--if\nnot, there are other options involving custom runners. Thanks,\n\nDavid Saff\n\nOn 12/13/06, Vietchau Nguyen &lt;vietchau.nguyen@...\n&lt;mailto:vietchau.nguyen%40eedo.com&gt; &gt; wrote:\n&gt; Hello,\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; I am new to JUnit and I am currently exploring the new verion, JUnit\n&gt; 4.1. I need to create unit tests for QA and they require an option to\n&gt; select which test to run at runtime. I know that there is the @Ignore\n&gt; but it need to be hard code at compile time... so I wonder if there is\n&gt; any other option in JUnit to let users specifies at runtime which\ntests\n&gt; to run? I saw the extension package, which have @Prerequisite\nannotation\n&gt; and will let me create a method eg. IsDBAvailable But I tried to have\n&gt; parameters to the method, eg. RunThisTest(String testName) and it\nwould\n&gt; not allow me to do so. .. I have too many test cases and I don&#39;t want\nto\n&gt; have to write a separate function for each of them. Any suggestion on\n&gt; how to skip a test at runtime is appreciated.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Thank you so much in advance,\n&gt;\n&gt; Vietchau\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
