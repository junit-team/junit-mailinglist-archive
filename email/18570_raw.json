The first few times\nI get excited, but then I realized that that there were always one or two\nreal failures and that the remaining failures resulted from those. That&#39;s\nwhen I decided that test isolation was a valuable and important\nproperty--the success or failure of one test should not affect the success\nor failure of another. One concrete corollary of this principle is the JUnit\npolicy of creating and setting up a new instance for each test. \n \nI wrote a little JUnit-ish performance testing framework while I was writing\nImplementation Patterns. Since some of the operations I was measuring were\nvery short, I didn&#39;t want an object allocation in the inner loop of the\ntimer so I reused the instances. I found it difficult to return each\ninstance to exactly the same state after the timed operation as it was in\nbefore.\n \nSeparate instances don&#39;t guarantee test isolation. If you use global or\nexternal resources, they can carry state between tests. However, the\nseparate instances give you a better chance of writing isolated tests. This\nis a case where I am happy to spend some CPU cycles to simplify the\nprogramming tasks. If you are willing to do the work yourself to return the\nworld to its original state at the end of every test or you are willing to\ngive up test isolation, you can use one of the mechanisms for shared\nsetup--TestSetup in JUnit 3.8.x and @BeforeClass in JUnit 4.\n \nRegards,\n \nKent Beck\nThree Rivers Institute\n\n\n  _____  \n\nFrom: junit@yahoogroups.com [mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com] On Behalf Of\nVietchau Nguyen\nSent: Thursday, December 21, 2006 8:10 AM\nTo: junit@yahoogroups.com\nSubject: [junit] How JUnit runs test class\n\n\n\nDear all,\n\nI am new to JUnit and so my question may be obvious... Is there a way to\nrun all test methods in a test class by create only one instance of the\nclass in JUnit? That is, not creating a new instance of the class for\neach test? \n\nI use \n\norg.junit.runner.JUnitCore.run(myClass.class)\n\nin the main program\n\nand if myClass has 100 test methods, the program will create 100\ninstances of myClass.\n\nI find that wasteful of resource because each time it will have to do\nall the setup again.\n\nThanks,\n\nVietchau\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n",
