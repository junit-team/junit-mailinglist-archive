Just a thought.\n&gt;\n&gt; Heck of a thought.\n&gt;\n&gt; I would expect:\n&gt;    a) The class structure would contain the test methods, but they\n&gt;        wouldn&#39;t be loaded in the absence of a -test flag, or some such.\n&gt;\n&gt;    b) With the -test option present, a framework would exist to help you\n&gt;\n&gt;         experiment with the APIs, uncovering gaps in the documentation.\n&gt;         (If I give an empty string as an argument, do I get a null\n&gt; String, an empty string, or an exception?)\n\nYes, both of these would be cool, especially if a reporting mechanism and\ndriver was built-into the JVM.  Not likely, but it&#39;s not impossible.\n\n&gt;    c) API documentation would have a link to a page containing test\n&gt;        methods that would exist only if the class was testable.\n&gt;\n&gt; Such a thing could be really cool, self-documenting addition to\n&gt; libraries.\n\nThat is a pretty cool idea.\n\n&gt; What the heck *is* unit testing, anyway? If it is &quot;class methods&quot;, then\n&gt; JUnitDoclet made sense. But if it is &quot;basic operations&quot;, isn&#39;t that more\n&gt; like integration testing? Or is there a middle ground, say, as package-\n&gt; level operations?\n&gt;\n&gt; Right now, I&#39;m seeing &quot;unit&quot; as one or more of:\n&gt;   * method\n&gt;   * class\n&gt;   * package\n&gt;   * use case\n&gt;\n&gt; Are there any other candidates? Are any of these automatically\n&gt; ruled out? What exactly does the word &quot;unit&quot; mean, in this\n&gt; context?\n\nI go by the Robert Binder definition, which is couched in a comprehensive\nthesis about the importance of identifying appropriate testing techniques\nand bug predictions for components at different scopes.  But the scopes used\nare traditional categories (in QA engineering, Boris Beizer and Gelnford\nMeyers pretty well represent the founders of tradition).\n\nFrom Binder&#39;s &quot;Testing Object-Oriented Systems,&quot; p. 45:\n\n&quot;The scope of a test is the collection of software components to be\nverified. [...] Scope is traditionally designated as unit, integration or\nsystem.&quot;\n\n&quot;The scope of a unit test typically comprises a relatively small executable.\nIn object-oriented programming, an object of a class is the smallest\nexecutable unit, but test messages must be sent to a method, so we can speak\nof method scope testing.  A test unit may consist of a class, several\nrelated classes (a cluster), or an executable binary file.  Typically it is\na cluster of interdependent classes.&quot;\n\nAnd, some gems from the chapter on &quot;Classes&quot; (chapter 10), p. 351:\n\nQ: Why Test at Class Scope?\nA [edited for length]:\n- System-level testing cannot exercise components to the same degree as\nclass scope testing.\n- Trying to exercise a class through its clients is usually like trying to\npick up a dime with boxing gloves. [one of my favorite lines from Binder&#39;s\nbook]\n- The longer the time between creation of a bug and its debut as a failure,\nthe higher the cost of correction.\n- Effective class scope testing reduces schedule risk and improves\nproductivity.\n- It is poor practice, at best, to foist testing on to developers of client\nclasses.\n\nScott Stirling\nFramingham, MA\n\n\n\n",
