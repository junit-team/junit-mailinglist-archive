It&#39;s <br/>\nchock full of concrete examples of test-driven development in action. <br/>\n Moreover, it answers a lot of questions frequently posted on this list <br/>\nwith respect to writing effective tests with JUnit.  But Dave doesn&#39;t <br/>\nstop there.  He also shows you how to use JUnit extensions and other <br/>\nxUnit tools.  Indeed, throughout the book he&#39;s building an application <br/>\ntest-first and reaches for a variety of tools along the way.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSo it&#39;s really at least two great books in one!<br/>\n<br/>\nMike<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nMike Clark<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://clarkware.com\">http://clarkware.com</a><br/>\n(720) 851-2014<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",
