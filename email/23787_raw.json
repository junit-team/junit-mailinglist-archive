It wo=\r\nrks for simple cases but with customized\n&gt; Runner-classes and new JUnit-fea=\r\ntures (e.g. the introduction of\n&gt; JUnit-Rules) the result is usually bad an=\r\nd it discourages the IDE users\n&gt; (i.e. the developers) from taking full adv=\r\nantage of JUnit!\n&gt;\n&gt; However, Maven (versions 2.0-2.2) and its Surefire-plu=\r\ngin has handled the\n&gt; JUnit-integration wonderfully, as far as I know, so y=\r\nour post worries me a\n&gt; little. What is it that you want to accomplish by m=\r\noving away from the\n&gt; successful(!) &quot;Junitcore+RunListener based approach&quot;?=\r\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Henrik\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In junit@yahoogroups.com, kristian@... wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n Hi,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I maintain the junit provider for maven-surefire, and I&#39;m look=\r\ning into\n&gt; transitioning from a Junitcore+RunListener based approach to an =\r\napproach\n&gt; based on something like BlockJUnit4ClassRunner.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Unfortun=\r\nately I cannot subclass the BlockJUnit4ClassRunner since the\n&gt; client code =\r\nitself may need to do that, so I&#39;d somehow need to put &quot;my&quot;\n&gt; &gt; Runner in f=\r\nront of the client-supplied one, maybe something proxy like.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Anyone=\r\n have any tips on this, maybe some existing code that does this ?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; K=\r\nristian\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]=\r\n\n\n\n",
