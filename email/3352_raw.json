This email is best suited for the \n&gt; junit-devel\n&gt; email list and not for the junit list which is more geared \n&gt; towards using\n&gt; junit.\n&gt; \n&gt; Chris\n&gt; \n&gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; From: Michael Silverstein [mailto:msilverstein@...]\n&gt; Sent: Tuesday, November 27, 2001 10:17 AM\n&gt; To: junit-devel@...; junit@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Subject: [junit] Making JUnit more pluggable for add-ons\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Problem statement\n&gt; -----------------\n&gt; I am adding some additional profiling and metrics to JUnit \n&gt; test execution.\n&gt; In order to do this I need to plug in to JUnit in such a way \n&gt; as to perform\n&gt; some operations before and after test execution, and to \n&gt; extend the test\n&gt; results to contain the new metrics. Presently the framework \n&gt; does not allow\n&gt; me to do this without altering it.\n&gt; \n&gt; Process\n&gt; -------\n&gt; I can either graft a new branch on to the JUnit source tree \n&gt; that contains\n&gt; various extensions built in and give it a new name (like JUnit XYZ or\n&gt; whatever) or provide some tweaks to the present framework \n&gt; that satisfy my\n&gt; needs in the hope they are accepted as part of the next \n&gt; version. The purpose\n&gt; of this email is to start a discussion about this so that \n&gt; whatever changes\n&gt; are necessary fit in with the architectural spirit of JUnit \n&gt; and are suitable\n&gt; for inclusion in a base release. If possible, I&#39;d like to \n&gt; wrap this up and\n&gt; make it publicly available by the end of the year.\n&gt; \n&gt; Note: I realize test cases are the recognized currency for \n&gt; articulating new\n&gt; functionality, so once there is agreement in principle to an \n&gt; approach, I can\n&gt; provide test cases to provide more detail.\n&gt; \n&gt; Wrapping test execution\n&gt; -----------------------\n&gt; I need to be able to start profiling immediately before a \n&gt; user test starts\n&gt; and end profiling immediately afterward. One approach is to \n&gt; wrap the user\n&gt; test class that is presently instantiated in\n&gt; junit.runner.BaseTestRunner.getTest(String) with a \n&gt; TestDecorator subclass\n&gt; instance that manages profiling during test execution. Creating the\n&gt; decorator sounds like a job for factory method [Gamma95].\n&gt; \n&gt; Extending the results\n&gt; ---------------------\n&gt; This is presently not easy because all the various test \n&gt; runners (subclasses\n&gt; of BaseTestRunner) implement their own createTestResult() \n&gt; method, where the\n&gt; reference to the TestResult class is hard coded. I&#39;d like to \n&gt; be able to\n&gt; specify that dynamically as well. This also sounds like a job \n&gt; for factory\n&gt; method [Gamma95].\n&gt; \n&gt; Toward a unified pluggable configuration approach\n&gt; -------------------------------------------------\n&gt; A possible approach is to employ the abstract factory pattern \n&gt; [Gamma95]\n&gt; where the concrete factory class contains factory methods for \n&gt; the above\n&gt; classes and others, is specified in the preferences file or \n&gt; elsewhere. This\n&gt; sort of architectural change would substantially enable the sort of\n&gt; pluggability that I&#39;m after.\n&gt; \n&gt; Some questions and observations about the framework\n&gt; ---------------------------------------------------\n&gt; Having spent some time digging into JUnit I have the \n&gt; following questions and\n&gt; comments:\n&gt; \n&gt; - The preferences file is read in more than one place:\n&gt;   - junit.runner.BaseTestRunner.readPreferences()\n&gt;   - junit.runner.TestCaseClassLoader.readExcludedPackages()\n&gt;   I could be wrong but it seems like this is redundant \n&gt; execution, especially\n&gt; since the preferences is kept in a static variable.\n&gt; \n&gt; - The preferences (junit.runner.BaseTestRunner.fPreferences) \n&gt; is static. It\n&gt; strikes me that this hampers testability of the framework \n&gt; because it makes\n&gt; it difficult to isolate the framework preferences from the \n&gt; preferences for\n&gt; instances of framework classes under test.\n&gt; \n&gt; - The TestResult class provides semantics for running and \n&gt; stopping tests.\n&gt; This seems like a stretch for a results class, which I would \n&gt; imagine is\n&gt; primarily a container for execution metrics and other downstream\n&gt; information.\n&gt; \n&gt; - The TestRunner variants are very tied to presentation \n&gt; layer. I see this\n&gt; has been discussed at length in the past so I won&#39;t belabor it.\n&gt; \n&gt; - It seems that since all the methods in \n&gt; junit.framework.Assert are static\n&gt; and it does not hold any state, there is really no need to \n&gt; make this class\n&gt; the root of all tests, except for the convenience of not \n&gt; prefixing assertion\n&gt; methods with &#39;junit.framework.Assert&#39;. I&#39;m sure I&#39;m missing \n&gt; something here.\n&gt; \n&gt; References\n&gt; ----------\n&gt; [Gamma95] Erich Gamma et al. &quot;Design Patterns - Elements of Rusable\n&gt; Object-Oriented Software&quot;, Addison-Wesley, Reading, MA, 1995.\n&gt; \n&gt; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n&gt; Mike Silverstein\n&gt; SilverMark, Inc.\n&gt; The object testing company\n&gt; http://www.silvermark.com\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
