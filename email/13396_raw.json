I have a few problems\n&gt; =\r\nwith that: \n&gt; \n&gt; - Writing mocks takes time, especially for packages not\n&gt; =\r\ndesigned for this (try mocking JMS factories or obscure JDBC\n&gt; drivers).  I=\r\nt also forces you to maintain an entire parallel\n&gt; hierarchy and basically =\r\nreimplement entire API&#39;s (which are\n&gt; sometimes based on concrete implement=\r\nations and not\n&gt; interfaces). That&#39;s a lot of code clutter.\n\nThat&#39;s true. O=\r\nn the other hand it will also prevent a lot of trouble:\n\n- it&#39;s easier to w=\r\nrite the tests (which might already result in an\nimprovement in overall tes=\r\nt writing time),\n- the tests run faster,\n- you can test conditions that are=\r\n virtually impossible to reliably induce\nwithout mocks,\n- your overall desi=\r\ngn improves, because thinking about how to write the\nmocks helps you to com=\r\ne up with better decoupled classes\n\nIn my experience, systematic use of moc=\r\nks generally decreases development\ntime and improves code quality.\n\n&gt; But w=\r\norse:\n&gt; \n&gt; - You are not testing exactly what goes in production.\n&gt; Introdu=\r\nce a subtle bug in your mock (return null instead of a\n&gt; real value) and yo=\r\nur tests will pass on your test machines and fail\n&gt; in production. \n\nTrue a=\r\ngain. You will still want to have *some* integrations tests, that\nfully tes=\r\nt 1-2-3-4 in concert. In my experience it&#39;s more effective having\nmost of t=\r\nhe tests not doing that, though.\n\n&gt; Writing mocks should be an option, but =\r\nthe testing framework\n&gt; should let me use dependencies and test production =\r\ncode if I\n&gt; so choose, and unfortunately, JUnit is of no help there.\n\nYou s=\r\nhould keep in mind that Junit is meant to be a *unit* testing\nframework, no=\r\nt a panacea. I&#39;m quite comfortable with Junit concentrating on\nits core res=\r\nponsibility, and using an extension or a different framework for\nfunctional=\r\n tests.\n\nTake care, Ilja\n\n\n",
