Initially, they were \n&gt; hesitant but I convinced them to use it once. Initially it \n&gt; may look as if its consuming time.\n&gt; \n&gt; After using it once, they realised that lot of time is saved \n&gt; in debugging .\n&gt; \n&gt; regards\n&gt; Suresh\n&gt; \n&gt; Carniel Frederic &lt;frederic.carniel@...&gt;:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; I tried to sell test first approch on java in my companie with junit\n&gt; &gt; and\n&gt; &gt; other tools for servlet testing (we use tomcat and sun jdk).\n&gt; &gt; The main question is :\n&gt; &gt; What is the overhead of time for coding test first ?\n&gt; &gt; Does someone know some comparaison document on time coding between\n&gt; &gt; standard\n&gt; &gt; coding and test first coding ?\n&gt; &gt; Could you give me a feed back of your experience? \n&gt; &gt; does it take more time or the same time ?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Thank you\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Fr�d�ric CARNIEL\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ------------------------ Yahoo!
