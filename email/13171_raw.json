Although i&#39;ve \nunzipped the file to a folder in C:, and use &quot;set CLASSPATH = C:&#92;..&quot; \n(and even go to Control Panel|System|Advanced tab|Environment Variable \nto edit the PATH variable to include the path to the folder, I still \ncouldn&#39;t run the installation test. The error was &quot;Exception in the \nthread &quot;main&quot; Java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError:&gt; junit/textui/TestRunner&quot;\nIt seems like the computer couldn&#39;t find the test files. Please Help :)\n  Sincerely,\n  Bob\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
