Quality code only comes from<br/>\n&gt; &gt; using TDD.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Again, this is a very bold claim, and one that is easy to challenge.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>So challenge it already.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Assume that you write a high-quality product using TDD, I can write this<br/>\n&gt; exact same high-quality product using all your same tests, except I won&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; have written them first.  And voila, high-quality software without ever<br/>\n&gt; using TDD.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>If you use my existing tests, then the design will still have been<br/>\ncreated by working on the tests first. Therefore your point is in<br/>\nerror.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; The truth is:  the main impact that TDD has when you develop software is on<br/>\n&gt; its design, not its quality.  Hence the last &quot;D&quot; in &quot;TDD&quot;.  I definitely<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Good quality comes from good design. (and caring and testing). So<br/>\nagain, you actually enforce my point.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; believe that software written using TDD will have a very different<br/>\n&gt; architecture from another software delivered with standard testing<br/>\n&gt; techniques (&quot;write the code, write the test, repeat&quot;).  But until you take a<br/>\n&gt; look at the tests themselves, you can&#39;t compare their quality just based on<br/>\n&gt; the testing methodology that was used.  After all, someone could be claiming<br/>\n&gt; to do TDD and only write one test (or tests that do no asserts) while the<br/>\n&gt; other non-TDD person will have written 1000 tests, and will therefore come<br/>\n&gt; up with higher quality code.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Claiming to do TDD is not doing TDD. I&#39;m talking here only about those<br/>\nthat care and are seeking to create quality software products.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I also believe that &quot;the simplest thing that can possibly work&quot; can lead to<br/>\n&gt; very bad design, but I&#39;ll save this for a different thread.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>My observation in 27 years of tinkering with computers and 17 years of<br/>\nearning my living with them, is that the simplest thing possible is<br/>\nusually the best thing to do. I&#39;d be glad to discuss that in a<br/>\ndifferent thread as well. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://simonpeter.org/technology/writings/fifthlaw.html\">http://simonpeter.org/technology/writings/fifthlaw.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\nSimon<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nwww.simonpeter.org</div>",
