I&#39;d like to\n&gt;     &gt; browse that list too.\n&gt; \n&gt; No.  Just go to the Ant homepage at Jakarta.  There is a link for\n&gt; subscribing to the user list (http://jakarta.apache.org/site/mail.html) as\n&gt; well as browsing the archives\n&gt; (http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=ant-user&r=1&w=2).\n\nThanks, I just subscribed.\n\n\n\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; &#39;haltonfailure=yes&#39; and/or &#39;haltonerror=yes&#39; should work here.\n&gt;     &gt;\n&gt;     &gt; Hmmm. I tried both of these and it says that the\n&gt;     &gt; attributes are not\n&gt;     &gt; supported\n&gt;     &gt; by this task I&#39;ve created.\n&gt; \n&gt; You have to add those attributes specifically to your script.  What I was\n&gt; referring to was running the &lt;junit/&gt; task that supports these attributes.\n&gt; Miscommunication...\n\nI goofed up too. I added in the throws new BuildException(), and rebuilt\nmy\nDixieCheck class, but I forgot to move it to the Ant lib&#92;optional area\nso\nit was using an older copy.  With the correct version, a failure stops\nthe\nbuild process. So, I can run without the mail server running and the\nbuild\nwill stop. With the server running, the build works. I didn&#39;t need to\nadd\nany attribute support in my DixieCheck class or anything.\n\n\n\n&gt; Ant has a very nice documentation package.  There is a doc/ directory in\n&gt; your Ant install_dir.\n\nYeah, I checked it out and it didn&#39;t have very much on how to make ones\nown\ntask (especially with some fancier options). The JavaDoc stuff is great,\nI\njust don&#39;t know where to look in the class tree for the information I\nneed :^)\n\n\n&gt;     &gt; I was thinking of two ways to kick off the server \n&gt; ...\n&gt;  [some useful info deleted]...\n&gt;\n&gt; Let&#39;s take it off-line if you need more help.\n\nYeah, I&#39;ll send you e-mail, as I&#39;d like to know how to do this. I&#39;ll\npost a\nsummary to the news group, if there is any interest.\n\n\nThanks for your help, I&#39;m getting closer.\n\n \nPCM (Paul Michali)\n\nCarrier Voice Gateway Business Unit (CVGBU)\nCisco Systems, Inc.\n250 Apollo Drive\nChelmsford, MA 01824\n\nPhone : (800) 572-6771 x 45817  (978) 244-5817 [direct]\nPaging: (800) 365-4578 [voice]  pcm@...
