Indeed, throughout the book he&#39;s building an \n&gt; application test-first and reaches for a variety of tools along the \n&gt; way.  \n\nIt only seems like it&#39;s throughout the book :-)\n\nOne &quot;Part&quot; of the book is a project being done test first (~ 225\npages) that uses a lot, though not all, of the tools and techniques\ndiscussed in the previous parts of the book.\n\nI do pull examples from the project to illustrate concepts earlier in\nthe book, though.\n\n&gt; So it&#39;s really at least two great books in one!\n\nHey!  Good line.. now maybe I can justify the ~550 pages!  It really\ndoes aim to be very comprehensive... apparently with good success.\n\nFor the record, I started this project last March and got the final OK\nwhile at XP2002 (which, if you were there & noticed, was why I was so\nhappy the last couple days :).  Anyway, a big part of the reason for\nwriting it was that there wasn&#39;t a comprehensive sourc of information\navailable... in fact when I started there wasn&#39;t anything on the\nshelves on TDD, just chapters or sections in various XP books (my own\nincluded).  At that point I was unaware of Kent&#39;s book-in-progress. \nBTW, I think my book makes a good followup to Kent&#39;s if you happen to\nbe working in Java.\n\nOnce it&#39;s out and (hopefully) you all read it, I&#39;d really like\nfeedback... I&#39;m contemplating a followup that continues by looking at\nother Java technologies (this book just deals with J2SE) such as J2EE\nand J2ME, maybe Jini.\n\nDave\nDave\n\n\n\n",
