It will be very helpful if your database or\n&gt; object model changes.\n&gt; \n&gt; Another solution can be to use Mock objects, but I\n&gt; personally think that \n&gt; it is overkilling for databases.\n&gt; \n&gt; If your database tests take too long to execute, you\n&gt; can just execute \n&gt; them each night, instead of every time.  Search for\n&gt; &quot;Continuous \n&gt; Integration&quot; on Sourceforge.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; 2) &lt;b&gt; How can you verify the execution path that\n&gt; a\n&gt; &gt; program is taking unless its output returned is\n&gt; unique\n&gt; &gt; for that path? &lt;/b&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; So you mean that your program is unpredictable?  So\n&gt; when you do the same \n&gt; thing twice with your program, you have two\n&gt; different results... really \n&gt; easy to learn ;-)\n&gt; \n&gt; More seriously, if you have a random program (let&#39;s\n&gt; say a roulette) it&#39;s \n&gt; always possible to change the random mechanism so\n&gt; that the generation of \n&gt; numbers is predictable (1, 2, 3, 4...).  Use Mock\n&gt; objects for that purpose.\n&gt; \n&gt; hth\n&gt; \n&gt; -Vladimir\n&gt; \n&gt; -- \n&gt; Vladimir Bossicard\n&gt; www.bossicard.com\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n=====\nfor good news go to http://members.tripod.com/goodnewsforyou/goodnews.html\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
