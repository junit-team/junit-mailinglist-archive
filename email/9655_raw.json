Frameworks can be a real barrier to \ntesting.\n\n\nAnother option:\nCan you subclass the class in question?\n\n\nAnother option:\nDigging *DEEP* into the bag of tricks, here&#39;s something to use when \nnothing else will work:  See Neil Swingler&#39;s javassist class loader \nin the Files section of this group:  \nName &quot;name.swingler.neil.classreloader.zip&quot;, description &quot;reloading \nclassloader that can introduce imposter mock classes&quot;.  It will \nenable you to swap out the offending 3rd party class with one of your \nown making.\n\nIn a similar situation, I used jAdvise (which is built on top of \njavassist) to intercept and modify the internal behavior of the 3rd \nparty class factory so that I could create instances of the class I \nwanted to test, intercept all method calls to it, and disable \neverything it did that had undesirable side effects, replacing method \nbody functionality with my mock implementation.\n\n\n\n",
