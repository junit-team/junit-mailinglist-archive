The rest of the team has zero interest in \nit.  But if I can get one, I might be able to topple the rest.  My \narguments to him consist of the following main points:\n\n1. The test&#39;s created aren&#39;t verification of functionality (like QA \nTesting) they are specification of functionality.  They are the design \nrequirements.  Therefore they are a fun and precise communication of \nsoftware intent.  This reduces confusion about the results expected by \nmanagers, co-workers, customers.  This makes it easy to communicate \nabout the software&#39;s behavior.\n2. The TDD paradigm leads to that holy grail of OO, decoupled code.  \nThis is the Nirvana that seems to be impossible to achieve using \nstandard development practices.   Decoupled code is testable, but it&#39;s \nalso extremely flexible.  Optimization is easy, algorithm replacement is \neasy, all change is easy when it&#39;s decoupled.\n\nObviously, we will also have less bugs.  But I can&#39;t seem to get him \nover the hump.  I think part of it is the resistance to the overwhelming \nparadigm shift.  The other part is convincing him that the traditional \nmindset has no built in checks and balances against the bad programming \npractice of spaghetti code or of forcing attention to code smells.  We \ndo refactor, but there is no pattern of refactoring as a method to \nremove TechnicalDebt.\n\nI&#39;ve as yet been unable to completely give myself over to this mindset.  \nIt&#39;s so radical a departure from the standard model.    Part of the \nissue is institutional(meaning the culture at work), but the rest is \njust the sheer inertia of making a change of this magnitude. \n\nI&#39;d appreciate any suggestions for arguments or examples to bring to the \ntable:\n\nThanks,\n\nDavid B.\n\n\n",
