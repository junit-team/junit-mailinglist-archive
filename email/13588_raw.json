I\n&gt; &gt; therefore tend to choose a language platform that is\n&gt; &gt; unfamiliar to the wider audience.  This helps the audience to\n&gt; &gt; not get caught up in implementation details (eg. coding\n&gt; &gt; styles, method names, etc.) because if it is a language they\n&gt; &gt; are unfamiliar with they will tend not to bother about those\n&gt; &gt; things.\n&gt;\n&gt; ...  but it seems to me they will be even more distracted by having to \n&gt; learn\n&gt; this unfamiliar platform and language.\n\nThat&#39;s just the point.  They didn&#39;t have to learn the \nplatform/language.  We focused on concepts, not implementation.  The \nfollow-up courses would need more knowledge of the platform/language.  \nBut with those follow-ups I still don&#39;t tend to force it upon them.  I \nlet the audience choose what suits them from an array of platforms and \nlanguages.  We lay down ground rules for what the platform needs to be \nable to accomplish and they are off on their own while I facilitate \ndiscussion and problem-solving.  This type of environment (more often \nthan not) also lends quite well to code sharing, paired programming, \nquick spikes, etc. which are very useful in the realm of testing.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; IMO, it should be the instructor who adjusts their class to what their\n&gt; students know and not the other way around...\n\nIn principal I don&#39;t disagree with you -- however, the students aren&#39;t \nexpected to adjust what they know to my class.\n\nIn taking this approach, I was helping the students to get the baggage \nout of the way.  I do this type of class with seasoned programmers who \ndon&#39;t have much experience in automated unit testing and it works \nbeautifully.  That isn&#39;t just my opinion, all the feedback I get from \nthese classes are generally very positive in regards to the language & \nplatform I end up choosing.  As I said in my original post, your mileage \nmay vary.  However, I think you do yourself a disservice by shooting it \ndown without trying it or experiencing it.\n\n-- \nJason Rogers\n\n&quot;I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I,\nbut Christ liveth in me: and the life which I now live in \nthe flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved \nme, and gave himself for me.&quot;\n    Galatians 2:20\n\n\n",
