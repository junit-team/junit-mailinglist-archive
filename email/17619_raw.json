First, the naming convention tells\nyou that a method is a constructor. Understanding Java should tell you\neverything you need to know about why that method is there. A\nconstructor&#39;s job is to ensure that an object is usable and &quot;ready to\nrock&quot; when it&#39;s handed off. Part of an object being &quot;ready to rock&quot;,\nis that it should be fully loaded and in a guaranteed valid state.\nTelling people to do the least amount possible in a constructor is\nencouraging them to hand out objects that are (potentially) in an\ninvalid internal state. That will get you a &quot;reading of the riot act&quot;\non any project that I&#39;m leading. An object must _always_ have a valid\ninternal state. As programs run in more and more multithreaded\nenvironments these days, this rule becomes even more important. You\n_never_ know when your object might be accessed, therefore it should\n_always_ be ready for access.\n\nI agree with point two, but sometimes naming conventions carry as much\nmeaning as a long method name. For example, a Struts Action object has\nan &quot;execute&quot; method; that&#39;s a short name and while it may seem that it\ncould benefit from expansion, in the context of a Struts application,\nit has a very well defined and understood meaning. (Kind of like\nconstructors. :-)\n\nPoint five. I agree up to a point. There will always be some things\nthat need to be done in specific sequences. Opening and closing files\nleaps to mind at this point.\n\nSimon\n\n-- \nwww.simonpeter.org\n\n",
