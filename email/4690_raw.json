I have also started to\nlook into Cactus project for servlet testing. I am one of the very few\npeople in the organization to know about this & want to share Junit&#39;s\nfeatures & advantages with others & convince them of its use. I have tested\nsome Java programs with Junit. I gave a presentation to my managar, to see\nif we can pilot the use of Junit in some project.\n\nCan someone tell me the real advantages of using Junit over the\nindividual&#39;s own Unit testing of the Java Code written by him. I have been\nreading the articles posted on Junit homepage. Where can I find more\narticles giving the advantages of Junit.\n\nThanks & Regards\nArathi\n\n-----------------------Disclaimer------------------------\n\nThe views of the author may not necessarily reflect those\nof the Company.
