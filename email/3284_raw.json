How do I write test cases for\n&gt; event driven program ?\n&gt; For e.g. I have a class A.\n&gt; This has three functions\n&gt; 1. public boolean ConnectURL();\n&gt; This function connects to a particular URL and loads the details onto the\n&gt; screen. If this is successful, it returns true else false.\n&gt; 2. public void Initialisation();\n&gt; This functions initializes some parameters\n&gt; 3. public boolean Save(Object obj);\n&gt; This function saves the details on the screen and if successful, it returns\n&gt; true, else false.\n&gt;\n&gt;  In my test class, I will be writing test methods for all these functions.\n&gt; 1. Do I need to write a test method for the second function that is just\n&gt; doing some initialization. If so, how will I write that ?\n\nYou can test several things in your testcase:\n\na) Does the call succeed without throwing an exception? Just calling the\nmethod in your testcase tells you somehting, without any assertions.\nCalling it by itself in a seperate test helps you locate the problem if\nsomething does actually throw an exception.\n\nb) Does it set any fields to initial values? Verify that the values are\ninitialized correctly. For example does isConnected() return false prior\nto the call the connectURL()?\n\nc) Test internal invariants. We define a method called checkInvariants()\nin each class we test. When called, this method asserts that certain rules\nabout its private state are valid. In your case, you might have an\ninvariant that an internal socket reference is null if and only if the URL\nis not connected. If you can figure out these invariants and add\nassertions for them, you can call checkInvariants() after the\ninitialization. It should also be called in every test whenever the class&#39;\nstate changes. Search these archives for my previous posts on invariants\nchecking.\n\n&gt; 2. For the first function, I will write a test method as follows\n&gt; public boolean testConnectURl() {\n&gt; \tA obj1;\n&gt; \tboolean  b = obj1.ConnectURL();\n&gt; \t/// How do I write an assert statement after this ?\n&gt; }\n\nAs above, just the fact that the call completes tells you something.\nHowever, there are several assertions you should be able to make, perhaps\nwith a little refactoring of the class.\n\na) Well, assert that b is true.\n\nb) Do you have an isConnected() or similar method? It should presumably\nreturn true after connectURL() is called.\n\nb) Does connecting set any other variables as a side effect? e.g. Can you\nrequest the host of the system connected to?\n\nd) This is another place where you should call a checkInvariants() method.\nThat method would have access to private state of the class, such as the\nunderlying socket. It could verify that, if the URL is connected, the\nsocket is valid and also connected.\n\n&gt; I have seen the archive of all the messages but I am not clear on how I\n&gt; write test classes for event driven programs.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks\n&gt;\n&gt; Sowmya\n&gt;  -----Original Message-----\n&gt; From: \tEric Vought [mailto:evought@...]\n&gt; Sent:\tFriday, November 09, 2001 10:45 PM\n&gt; To:\tjunit@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Subject:\tRe: [junit] Inner Class, Even Driven Classes\n&gt;\n&gt; The short answer is that they are usually tested in the same testcase as the\n&gt; enclosing class. Where the testcase are complex enough for a sepearte\n&gt; testcase class to make sense, refactoring the inner class to the top level\n&gt; will also typically make sense. For the long answer, I&#39;ll lay out a few\n&gt; cases for you and how they are handled in my experience.\n&gt; If the class is a tightly coupled private utility, like an iterator or an\n&gt; event adapter, these are typically tested in the test case for the class.\n&gt; In the case of an event listener, whether the listener is implemented by an\n&gt; adapter or the class itself is a minor organizational detail. The important\n&gt; question is whether the event is dispatched correctly. With iterators, they\n&gt; tend to be very minor in functionality and extremely tightly coupled.\n&gt; Iterators are therefore more of a special reference or psuedopod of the\n&gt; class-under-test than a separate entity and are also tested in the same\n&gt; testcase.\n&gt; Sometimes, you use an inner class to define an interface that goes along\n&gt; with it, such as defining static inner  classes to represent listeners for\n&gt; events which only that class will generate. The example I have in front of\n&gt; me right now is a class called LogListener.MaskChangeListener. LogListener\n&gt; accepts logging events from a Logger for dispatch. A particular LogListener,\n&gt; however, only accepts events of a particular set of priorities (e.g. WARNING\n&gt; or above). A Logger wishes to avoid instantiating messages that will never\n&gt; be processed, so it monitors the priority masks of its Listeners. It should\n&gt; be obvious that MaskChangeListener is very specific to LogListener and\n&gt; therefore may as well be a part of it.\n&gt; In these cases, you have a base class or interface which will be implemented\n&gt; or extended by some other class. The general practice here is to create a\n&gt; testcase for that base class (using a stub implementation) and then the\n&gt; testcases for actual implementations can inherit your abstract testcase to\n&gt; ensure that invariants are maintained. With the inner class situation,\n&gt; however, most of the eventual implementations will themselves be inner\n&gt; classes (adapters) and therefore will not be tested as separate entities.\n&gt; Further, there really aren&#39;t any invariants to be maintained beyond what the\n&gt; compiler will verify for you- namely, that a method exists with that\n&gt; signature in the implementing class. So, in this case, too, there isn&#39;t any\n&gt; special testing to be done.\n&gt; As your inner class gets more complex- perhaps it is an abstract class with\n&gt; some fields or concrete code- the case for doing a seperate testcase gets\n&gt; stronger, but so does the case for refactoring. Even if the inner class\n&gt; needs access to private state which you don&#39;t wish to expose, the dependency\n&gt; can probably be reduced through refactoring to the point where you can use\n&gt; simple listeners and adapters to connect two top-level classes.\n&gt; The borderline case I sometimes run into is an inner class representing a\n&gt; souped up type-safe enumeration. The enumeration has methods to produce or\n&gt; parse a human-readable representation of a value and has some special code\n&gt; to handle serialization safely. If the enumeration is conceptually coupled\n&gt; to the enclosing class, it makes sense to leave it as an inner class.  There\n&gt; is *some* significant functionality to test (mostly looking for simple\n&gt; typing errors), which is conceptually different from the functionality of\n&gt; the top-level class and tends to clutter the testcase a little if included.\n&gt; I could see a case for breaking this out into multiple testcase if there\n&gt; were a number of similar inner classes in the top-level class. Otherwise, I\n&gt; still tend to keep all the tests in one container.\n&gt; On Fri, 9 Nov 2001 sowmya.srinivasan@... wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Hello\n&gt; &gt; I have just started using JUnit.\n&gt; &gt; I have a few queries.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; 1.
