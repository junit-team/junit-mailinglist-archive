Although i&#39;ve \n&gt; unzipped the file to a folder in C:, and use &quot;set CLASSPATH = C:&#92;..&quot; \n&gt; (and even go to Control Panel|System|Advanced tab|Environment \nVariable \n&gt; to edit the PATH variable to include the path to the folder, I still \n&gt; couldn&#39;t run the installation test. The error was &quot;Exception in the \n&gt; thread &quot;main&quot; Java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError:&gt; \njunit/textui/TestRunner&quot;\n&gt; It seems like the computer couldn&#39;t find the test files.
