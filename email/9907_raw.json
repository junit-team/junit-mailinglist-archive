Rainsberger wrote:\n&gt; Then I would override runBare() to generate more events: one after \n&gt; setUp() and one before tearDown(), then augment TestListener, then have \n&gt; the test monitor implement the bigger TestListener interface. All you \n&gt; need are two more events, and since you can fix that in one place....\n&gt; \n&gt; It&#39;s entirely possible that JUnit-addons Test Runner already does this.\n&gt; \n&gt; Understand, I&#39;m not trying to squash your enthusiasm for AOP. You just \n&gt; have that Golden Hammer look in your eye.... \n\nYep, this does work fine, if you don&#39;t have any fixture-setup code in your \ntestcase itself.  However, many people haven&#39;t refactored all fixture code into \nsetUp() and tearDown().  If this is the case, there could be some time-consuming \nfixture code in the test methods themselves.  This would mean that checking \ntimes after setUp() and before tearDown() would still be counting the fixture \nexecution time in with the Class Under Test execution time.\n\nHaving a listener is another viable Plain Java approach, but you would still \nhave to manually fire the listener before and after you actual invocation of the \nclass under test.  This is the type of non-refactorable duplication that AOP solves.\n\nI&#39;m not advocating AOP in all cases, in fact I think you should try hard to find \na Plain Java solution that works before resorting to AOP.  I&#39;m just trying to \nillustrate that it could be useful in a specific scenario:  Monitoring execution \ntime of the class under test if 1) you have fixture setup code in your test \nmethods and 2) the execution time of that fixture setup code could obscure the \nactual execution time of the Class Under Test.\n\nMost likely this isn&#39;t the situation of the original poster, so it doesn&#39;t \nmatter.  We can drop this thread before people start complaining :).\n\nThanks,\nChad\n\n\n\n",
