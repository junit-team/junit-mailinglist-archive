For this purpose I wish to add a piece of code to be called after<br/>\n&gt; each test has been run. I noticed that TestResult has a possibility to<br/>\n&gt; add such a piece of code through TestListener.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; However, adding the listener requires that I have access to the<br/>\n&gt; TestResult objects created. And these in turn are created in the<br/>\n&gt; TestRunner instances. And if I run my tests from an IDE or Ant, the<br/>\n&gt; runner used is out of my control.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I am thinking I could just modify the TestResult to always add my<br/>\n&gt; listener in its constructor or something similar (maybe a static<br/>\n&gt; listener..). But I am not sure if this is the best solution.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; So I guess my questions are:<br/>\n&gt;  -Did I understand the code correctly?<br/>\n&gt;  -Is there a way for me to easily add such a listener, hopefully without<br/>\n&gt;   messing too much with the JUnit sources?<br/>\n&gt;  -Can anyone think of reasons why modifying TestResult to contain my<br/>\n&gt; listener would not work? Are there some cases or environments that modify<br/>\n&gt; the execution so they dont use the standard TestResult? For example Ant,<br/>\n&gt; etc..<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Is this something that can&#39;t just be put into tearDown(), which is <br/>\ninvoked after each test runs, regardless of whether it succeeded?</div>",
