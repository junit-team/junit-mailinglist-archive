I think that\ngetTestClass(), ge=\r\ntMethodName() and getClassName() are currently\nimplemented wrong: see https=\r\n://github.com/KentBeck/junit/issues/198\nfor how I&#39;d rather approach it.  In=\r\n short, I&#39;d like for Description to\nremain a serializeable, final, value cl=\r\nass, but allow for custom\nRunners to have full control over what data gets =\r\nput into that value\nstructure.  Would that work for you?  If so, want to pr=\r\noduce a patch\nfor this?\n\nSeparate from this are the problems that arise fro=\r\nm Description\ncontaining both the test structure graph, and the metadata fo=\r\nr each\nnode in that graph, but that doesn&#39;t seem to be your current\nchallen=\r\nge.\n\nOn the subject of error messages for Assume.*:  Oops.  :-)  Patches\nde=\r\nfinitely welcome.\n\n   David Saff\n\nOn Thu, Oct 27, 2011 at 5:05 PM, Dawid We=\r\niss &lt;dawid.weiss@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Hi everyone.\n&gt;\n&gt; My name is Dawid Weis=\r\ns, I&#39;m a committer to Apache Lucene/Solr. Lucene\n&gt; and Solr use a custom ru=\r\nnner to randomize test execution extensively.\n&gt; This works great and I&#39;ve d=\r\necided to try to pull a custom JUnit runner\n&gt; out of Lucene so that it can =\r\nbe reused without relying on the rest of\n&gt; Lucene&#39;s infrastructure. So... I=\r\n wrote a custom runner and on the way\n&gt; I came across a problem: I would re=\r\nally like to have a hierarchy of\n&gt; Descriptions to indicate something meani=\r\nngful, in particular contain\n&gt; the random seed for a suite group, then for =\r\nindividual tests, etc. I\n&gt; believe a similar situation could also be useful=\r\n for\n&gt; ParameterizedRunner...\n&gt;\n&gt; Unfortunately, the problem is that Descri=\r\nption is sealed and does not\n&gt; allow much in terms of flexibility (the cons=\r\ntructor is private, static\n&gt; factory methods).\n&gt;\n&gt; The design of this class=\r\n leads me to believe that Description should\n&gt; be a contract (interface or =\r\na class, but with the possibility of\n&gt; subclassing) so that getDisplayName(=\r\n) returns something meaningful (as\n&gt; in the example above), but getTestClas=\r\ns(), getMethodName() and\n&gt; getClassName() can still point IDEs and report w=\r\nriters to the right\n&gt; place. Or at least allow a custom display name not re=\r\nlated to the\n&gt; method name/ class of the test case?\n&gt;\n&gt; Another burning iss=\r\nue we have in Lucene is that Assume.* methods don&#39;t\n&gt; take any explanation =\r\nmessage. Why is this so? I mean: an assumption\n&gt; can fail, but just like wi=\r\nth failures it&#39;d be nice to be actually able\n&gt; to explain why a given assum=\r\nption wasn&#39;t met...\n&gt;\n&gt; Let me know what you think. I can provide a patch (=\r\nseveral ones :),\n&gt; but I wanted to hear what people think first.\n&gt;\n&gt; Dawid\n=\r\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
