One of the\nclevernesses was how it would prioritize test-input generation to attempt\nto produce not-yet-seen behaviors.  So, if in an initial test run, a method\nalways returned true, the engine would analyze the code to see if there was\na way to make it return false.  In the beginning, these observations were\nencoded in a proprietary observations database, but later, they figured out\nhow to use those observations to generate Java code in the form of JUnit\ntests.\n\nIn my opinion, those tests were never really a great idea to use, without\nreflection, as _tests_ that should be treated identically to\nhuman-generated tests.  But they still had use:\n\n1) They were a map of the behavior of your program:\n\nOne of the more interesting bugs found was that Agitar found a method that\nwas only ever called with positive floats; the intended input had been for\npositive and negative floats, and it turned out there was a bug in the\ncalling method.\n\n2) They could indicate the scope of change:\n\nEven if you never looked at the content of the generated tests, you could\ngenerate tests against all the classes on V1 of a package, and then run\nthose tests on V2, and look at what failed (assuming, usually correctly,\nthat even intended behavior changes would cause test failures).  If the\nfailures were all in tests against classes whose behavior you expected to\nchange, great.  If there were changes in other classes, that might be a\nproblem.\n\n3) They could be used with Theories to automatically find actual bugs.\n\nIf you could specify a desired feature of your code as a Theory (a function\nasserting an invariant property over a practically infinite set of possible\ninputs), then you could use Agitar&#39;s corner-case-seeking engine to try to\nfind an input that violated that invariant:\n\nhttp://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/40090/MIT-CSAIL-TR-2008-002.pdf\n\nI think there&#39;s still room for a lot of progress to be made on these ideas,\nbut my experience with Agitar makes me think that it&#39;s more likely to come\nfrom open source efforts, or internal tool building at a large software\ncompany, than as a profit-making sellable tool.\n\n   David Saff\n\n\nOn Sat, Feb 1, 2014 at 5:00 PM, Malte Finsterwalder &lt;\nmalte@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Maybe you can check out agitar.
