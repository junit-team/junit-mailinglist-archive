How do you get the (asserted) \n&gt; benefits of mocks as a design technique for new code?\n\nI&#39;m not completely sure what you mean.  I think that you mean writing \nyour mocks along with your tests, and building/refactoring them as you \nprogressively flesh out your design (as has been discussed recently on \nthe test driven development mailing list).\n\nIn any case, I think that you are pointing out what I perceive to be the \nmajor drawback of any dynamic mock approach (virtual mocks or dynamic \nproxies).  This drawback is reusability.  If you mock everything on a \nper-call basis, then this is obviously specific to the current test \nscenario.  You can&#39;t reuse this &quot;mock&quot; in another test which may reqire \nthe mocking of completely different calls to the object.\n\nWith a &quot;real&quot; mock/fake object (one that is actually a compiled class), \n  you can define default behaviors (return values / parameter \nvalidations) which will always be used no matter what context you use \nthe object in.\n\nIt looks like DynaMock is working towards an innovative solution to this \nproblem, in the form of &quot;default return stubs&quot; \n(http://www.mockobjects.com/wiki/ChangesInNatsBranch).\n\nWith this approach, I can see that dynamic/virtual mocks can possibly \nachieve the same reusability benefits as &quot;real&quot; mocks.  This could be \ndone by &quot;pre-configuring&quot; dynamic/virtual mock objects which are \nreusable across tests.  In other words, defining what should happen for \neach possible method call on the object, regardless of the current context.\n\nIf this were made easy to do, then I can see dynamic/virtual mocks being \n  indistinguishable from &quot;real&quot; mocks in terms of functionality.  You \ncan still use an interface-driven design process, except it would be \nwithout the interfaces.\n\nI&#39;m still trying to get the concept of interface driven design, so I may \nbe off base.  Let me know what you think.\n\n-- Chad\n\n\n\n\n",
