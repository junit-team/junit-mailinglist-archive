Courtesy would demand that\nthe new user spend time exploring the site, the documentation, and so\nforth, plus perhaps monitor the list for a bit before posting to it.\nHowever, I have noticed two things, both of which surprise me in different\nways.\n\n1) Some people simply aren&#39;t courteous and really expect people to do\ntheir work for them. Many of these people seem to succeed at this in their\nworkplace and, when required to do something new, extend that practice to\nthe net. Over time, however, I&#39;ve discovered that the number of people in\nthis category is actually not large and that many people actually belong\nin the 2nd category.\n\n2) Some people simply don&#39;t have the first clue how to be courteous in\nthis environment. Typically they are either students or professionals who\nhave suddenly had new demands placed on them and are not self-starters.\nThey may try to figure things out at first, but simply have no context to\nstart. As they may already be frustrated and resentful, they give up\nquickly, especially if they are not strong in english.\n\nThe utter lack of context in this second group has surprised me greatly\nand I think it is hard for many in the OS community to grasp. For example,\nI still commonly run into junior programmers who don&#39;t know what a &quot;FAQ&quot;\nis or what a &quot;list archive&quot; is for. They see these words on the site but\ndon&#39;t know what to do with them.\n\nMost projects are organized similarly. I&#39;ve been around the internet\nenough that when I look at a new project I pretty much go through things\nin a set order and know exactly what to look for. If the things I need are\nnot there, I will most likely just skip it and go back to FreshMeat for a\ndifferent, similar project. Most people who answer questions on this list\nare the same. It is hard for me to believe that people still lack these\nskills, but they really do.\n\nEven if someone does know what these things are, I have watched people\nflounder for hours with a search engine or list archive becuase they don&#39;t\nhave good research skills and don&#39;t know what to search for or they don&#39;t\nknow how to work through the hits and figure out which ones are really\nrelevant to their issues. Again, this is especially true for people who\nare not strong in english.\n\nI am at a loss for how to deal with this effectively and would welcome\ndiscussion. One thing that I have seen have some positive effect is a FAQ\nposting at regular intervals (e.g. weekly) to the list. This posting\nshould be targetted at this second category of individuals, carefully\nexplaining where to find docs, tutorials, how to search the archives,\netc., as well as making a plain statement to the first category that they\nare expected to do their own homework. We might even consider making this\npost multi-language. The FAQ should also always be the first message a new\nsubscriber receives (replacing the current &quot;Welcome to JUnit&quot; message.\nThis adds a little clutter to the list, but, with a clear subject line\nit&#39;s easy to avoid and may reduce clutter overall.\n\nOn Mon, 15 Oct 2001, J. B. Rainsberger wrote:\n\n&gt; Ladies and Gentlemen:\n&gt;\n&gt; I am frankly quite concerned with the quality of the exchanges going on here\n&gt; in the last several weeks. It appears that many people think there are\n&gt; &quot;magic formulas&quot; for working with JUnit. As a result, they ask silly\n&gt; questions like, &quot;How do I test an EJB with JUnit????&quot; The people who know\n&gt; the answer get so tired of writing, &quot;Search this list. Try it. What are you\n&gt; having trouble testing?&quot; that they simply stop responding. As a result,\n&gt; questions are not being answered.\n&gt;\n&gt; I would like to ask everyone on this list to ask specific, pointed\n&gt; questions, with sample code, if at all possible. Instead of &quot;How to I test\n&gt; an EJB????&quot;, how about, &quot;I did X, Y and Z to test EJBs using JUnit, but it&#39;s\n&gt; too slow. Any tips for increasing speed? Here is a sample EJB tets case...&quot;?\n&gt;\n&gt; If you really don&#39;t know how to do X, try searching the web first. Try\n&gt; searching this list&#39;s archives next. If that does not get you going, then by\n&gt; all means, ask a specific, pointed question.\n&gt;\n&gt; Please, folks! I don&#39;t want to start ignoring this list because its readers\n&gt; show no initiative.\n&gt;\n&gt; JBR.\n&gt;\n&gt; _________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Get your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com/intl.asp\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
