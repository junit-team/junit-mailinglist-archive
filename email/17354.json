I suspect that<br/>\nby careful observation of the API of a DynaActionForm, you should be<br/>\nable to build one yourself.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo get a good understanding of what went into an ActionMapping, I used<br/>\nthe debugger in my IDE and set a breakpoint in my action and drilled<br/>\ndown into the mapping. You could do the same with the DynaActionForm.<br/>\n<br/>\nSimon<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On 8/9/06, Chuck &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:nessies2003@...\">nessies2003@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; Hello,<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m currently writing tests for my web-applicaiton using JUnit and I<br/>\n&gt; came across a method I need to test that takes a DynaActionForm as a<br/>\n&gt; parameter.  Problem is, I can&#39;t get ahold of the form with the beans<br/>\n&gt; it needs inside of the method, from my JUnit test.  Is there a way to<br/>\n&gt; initialize a new ActionForm object from scratch using either an action<br/>\n&gt; path as a string or a form-bean name?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -Chuck<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nwww.simonpeter.org </span></blockquote></div>",
