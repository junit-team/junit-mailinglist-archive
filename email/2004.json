Didn&#39;t mean to impose my opinion onto others.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe method name should tell you what this method is.  So IMHO,<br/>\ntestNeedImplement() seems to fit better.<br/>\n<br/>\nSecond, a REAL post-it or a note at the back of your task card seem to work a<br/>\nlot more effectively.<br/>\n<br/>\nActually, I applaud for the other post about the Calendar assertion.  That seems<br/>\nto be something novel.  :)<br/>\n<br/>\nRobert Watkins wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; Shane Duan wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Plus, I am sure that all the XP developers would strongly<br/>\n&gt; &gt; disagree with the comment here.  The closest way I can think<br/>\n&gt; &gt; of is to name the method as test_NeedImplement() but it sure<br/>\n&gt; &gt; looks weird.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Mind if I ask why exactly do you want a empty test method<br/>\n&gt; &gt; there?  What is the difference if you just add the method later?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; XP developers will say nothing of the sort. If the comment is the simplest<br/>\n&gt; thing that works, go for it. FWIW, I would use the method name to tell me<br/>\n&gt; what I&#39;m meant to be testing.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; As to why: it&#39;s a placeholder so you don&#39;t forget it. Consider it similar to<br/>\n&gt; a PostIt note.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Robert.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --<br/>\n&gt;      &quot;Duct tape is like the Force: it has a light side, a dark side,<br/>\n&gt;                    and it holds the universe together&quot;<br/>\n&gt;   Robert Watkins     <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:robertdw@...\">robertdw@...</a>     <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:robertw@...\">robertw@...</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\">junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
