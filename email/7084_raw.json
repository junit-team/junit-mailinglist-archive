So, if your\ncode\n&gt; is done then yes it&#39;s too late. Then there isn&#39;t any unit test approach.\n&gt; Just stick to use-case tests.\n\nAs others have pointed out, that is *not* the unit test approach. They\npointed out that they and others have written unit tests for legacy code,\nand that it is never too late to write such tests. I would point out that\nthere is (at least in my mind) a difference between Test Driven Development\nand Unit Testing; Unit Testing is a tool that TDD uses to accomplish its\ngoals and objectives, but Unit Testing can be used in various other ways and\nat various other times. As I have said here recently, I advocate Unit\nTesting by independent testers *after* code has been written - even when TDD\nwas used in the design and development of that code. While TDD may be the\nfirst time code is tested, it is not the only or last time that code code\nneeds to tested - it is just the earliest time.\n\nFWIW,\nLauren\n\n=====\nLooking for an experienced Java/C++ Software Engineer?\nSee: http://developerdude.mystarband.net/resume.html\n\n\n",
