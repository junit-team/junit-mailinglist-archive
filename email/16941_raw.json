I don&#39;t have the energy to list all\n&gt;  &gt; the problems with it, but I will point out that someone on this list\n&gt;  &gt; wrote about 300 pages on bringing Java legacy code under test, including\n&gt;  &gt; dozens of examples that cover the core of a J2EE application. What more\n&gt;  &gt; do you need?\n&gt; \n&gt; I never said it was not possible, I was just complaining about the way Agile\n&gt; developers try to convince their audience.\n\nI wish you would qualify that statement somehow. &quot;many&quot;, &quot;some&quot;, &quot;a \nfew&quot;... surely not /all/.\n\n&gt; As for the &quot;sloppiest&quot; part, about forty people have commented on my post so\n&gt; far, and a lot of them with experiences confirming my observations. Maybe\n&gt; you find it sloppy, but I suggest you look beyond the form, because there\n&gt; are obviously some real points in there...\n\nI find it sloppy to generalize to an entire community based on the \nactions of a few. That&#39;s what you seem to be doing. I find it sloppy to \nclaim that there&#39;s nothing in the literature that talks about testing \nreal J2EE applications, when clearly there is. I further find it sloppy \nto appeal to the reasoning of other sloppy thinkers, no matter how many \nof them happen to agree with you.\n\nIn general, we make far too many sweeping generalizations (irony \nintended as a joke). I, for one, try to qualify my statements and base \nthose qualifications on real evidence. I think it would be very nice \nindeed if more of us did that more often.\n-- \nJ. B.
