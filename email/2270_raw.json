You can still have the print method\nthat will format the contents of the vector for you.\n\nIf you don&#39;t want to open up the vector, how about passing in a printstream\nto the print method?  That way you could test that the stream contains\neverything you expect it to have.\n\nFYI: There is overhead in Vector that probably isn&#39;t needed in your class --\nyou should be using a List (i.e. ArrayList).\n\n-Jason\n\n    &gt; -----Original Message-----\n    &gt; From: the_shark_tank@...

I am \n    &gt; supposed to \n    &gt; implement junit tests on code that I have just written. \n    &gt; However, what \n    &gt; I have learned in school does not seem to apply here!  We learned \n    &gt; that if the method is an &quot;add&quot; method, give it two numbers, \n    &gt; and &quot;assert&quot; that the corrent addition is performed, and \n    &gt; so on. . .  \n    &gt; well, I have no clue what to assert!\n    &gt; \n    &gt; Quick rundown of what I am testing:\n    &gt; \n    &gt; Basically, my code is using the Reflection class to check all the \n    &gt; members of a class for a certain type of compatibility.  \n    &gt; Most methods \n    &gt; add errors to an error vector, and then there is a simple print \n    &gt; function to print out the vector... How on earth do I test this \n    &gt; class??  \n    &gt; \n    &gt; Thanks for any help in advance!!\n    &gt; \n    &gt; Yours truly,\n    &gt; The Shark\n    &gt; \n    &gt; \n    &gt; ------------------------ Yahoo!
