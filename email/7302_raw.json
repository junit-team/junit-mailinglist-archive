I can see from the FAQ \nhttp://junit.sourceforge.net/doc/faq/faq.htm#organize_3 that there is a \nway to write code such that setUp or tearDown methods are called only \nonce, but that this is not encouraged.\n\nMy situation is that I was just adding logging support to my classes, \nand that the classes are set up so that each time a class is created it \nis handed a unique id.  As a consequence if I have 7 test methods in my \nclass, the logging system gets initialized 7 times (since the init() \nmethod is in setUp) and 7 objects with 7 different object ids get \ncreated, one for each test method.\n\nI can see that conceivably there might be interactions such that the \nmultiple re-initializations help make the tests more robust, but I&#39;m not \nsure quite what they are.\n\nSo my question is, does initialization of a logging system count as \nsomething that deserves a unique setUp method?\n\nAnd if I want to conduct a series of tests on one object with a \nparticular id, should I try and create the object in a unique setUp \nmethod, or should I create single test methods that test a series of \noperations on a particular object?\n\nI am guessing that really I should have multiple test methods, to test \neach operation and then other tests to test series of combined \noperations.  I am then concerned about whether these more complex tests \nshould be in the same test class or in a different one.  Perhaps unit \ntesting should only ever test a single method at a time, and the desire \nto test a series of them at once suggests there should be another \nmethod, or object that can encapsulate the complex operation, and then \nthis can be tested in another class?\n\nThanks in advance.\n\nCHEERS&gt; SAM\n\n\n\n",
