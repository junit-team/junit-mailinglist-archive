The\nchallenge =\r\nis that some runners (Eclipse, for example) really want\nnames of all the te=\r\nsts you&#39;re going to run before you run them.  One\ncurrent possibility is to=\r\n actually run the tests during the\ngetChildren phase, and then just report =\r\nthe results during the\nrunChild phase.  That likely delays any output until=\r\n all tests have\nrun.  Will that work for you?\n\nThe alternative is an extend=\r\ned listener framework.  Which test runner\nare you using?\n\n   David Saff\n\nOn=\r\n Fri, Jun 17, 2011 at 8:43 AM, huntchrisalias &lt;huntchr@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; =\r\nHi there,\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;m writing a custom test runner that is not easily able to d=\r\netermine how many tests will be executed in advance.\n&gt;\n&gt; The runner extends=\r\n ParentRunner and its getChildren method is called prior to tests being exe=\r\ncuted via runChild. Each test is also described via describeChild.\n&gt;\n&gt; Duri=\r\nng runChild execution, if I create child descriptions of each child as each=\r\n unforeseeable test occurs, then I get &quot;unrooted&quot; output.\n&gt;\n&gt; My actual use=\r\n-case is that I have a test runner executing a series of tests within an ht=\r\nml file. I would have to parse the html and its associated JavaScript to de=\r\ntermine how many tests will be run. This would be tricky.\n&gt;\n&gt; Is there a re=\r\ncommended means of reporting the results of tests that are not determinable=\r\n in advance?\n&gt;\n&gt; Kind regards,\n&gt; Christopher\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ----------------------=\r\n--------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
