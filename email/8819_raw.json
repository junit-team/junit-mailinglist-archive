[mailto:john.link@...]\nInviato: luned� 28 luglio 2003 11.55\nA: junit@yahoogroups.com\nOggetto: Re: [junit] Testing for rubustness against &quot;Missed\nnotification&quot; and &quot;Early notification&quot;\n\n\n&gt; We&#39;ve a couple of places where we have threads waiting for eachother using\n&gt; notification&quot;. Has anybody already though through how best to test this?\n..cut...\n&gt; Or\n&gt; does anyone have a reference to an article or web where this test may be\n&gt; described in a generic way or with an example?\n\n..cut..\n\nHowever, the inherent indeterminism requires a lot of effort to come up with\nsuch a test suite. In most situations it&#39;s probably more effective to  have\nthe multi-threaded code reviewed by expeprienced &quot;thread programmers&quot;. Even\nbetter: Use threading libraries (eg the one described in Doug Lea&#39;s seminal\nwork &quot;Concurrent Programming in Java&quot;)  which hide most of the intricacies\nof\nthreaded programming.\n\nJohannes\n\n--\n+++ GMX - Mail, Messaging & more  http://www.gmx.net +++\n\nJetzt ein- oder umsteigen und USB-Speicheruhr als Pr�mie sichern!\n\n\n\nTo unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\njunit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n\n\nYour use of Yahoo!
