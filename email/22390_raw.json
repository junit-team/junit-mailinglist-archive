I then ran into the test case \n&gt; &gt; that confirms t=\r\nhat action.  Coming from the aspect that I \n&gt; &gt; want to have confidence tha=\r\nt my code and tests are \n&gt; &gt; functioning properly, I honestly think that is=\r\n the wrong action.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; If an assumption is violated then it should be =\r\neither a \n&gt; &gt; failure or at best ignored.  To say the test passes because \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; something failed is like saying you don&#39;t have a cavity \n&gt; &gt; because th=\r\ne dentist doesn&#39;t have the right tool.  You don&#39;t \n&gt; &gt; know one way or the =\r\nother, and the test won&#39;t be able to run \n&gt; &gt; properly when the assumption =\r\nis violated.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; It&#39;s partly that reason that I don&#39;t use assumptions =\r\nto begin \n&gt; &gt; with.  If there needs to be a certain precondition to the \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; test passing, I will add those assertions before I perform \n&gt; &gt; the actio=\r\nn that needs to be tested.  To me, it is a failure \n&gt; &gt; if the test could n=\r\not be set up properly.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; If you want something a little softer, then=\r\n I recommend that \n&gt; &gt; a failed assumption is equivalent to the @Ignore ann=\r\notation.  \n&gt; &gt; You&#39;ll see in the summary that X number of tests were run, Y=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; number of tests ignored, and Z number of tests failed.  \n&gt; &gt; Although=\r\n, for ignored tests I&#39;d like to see what the reason \n&gt; &gt; was (failed assump=\r\ntion or manually ignored through the attribute).\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Making a test pas=\r\ns because of a failed assumption gives you a \n&gt; &gt; false sense of security a=\r\nbout your code.  What is happening \n&gt; &gt; is that the test just wasn&#39;t run, a=\r\nnd there may be a \n&gt; &gt; legitimate problem hiding.  To me that is the most d=\r\nangerous \n&gt; &gt; part of that solution.  I&#39;d rather get the bad news straight =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; than trust faulty information.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Am I making sense?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Yahoo!
