Although this seems to be the wrong package, I cannot find out the right package.<br/>\n<br/>\nTherefore I would like to follow the common approach to use the same package for the class and for the test. Additionally the test&#39;s name is the class name with Test suffix.<br/>\n<br/>\nTherefore the AssumptionTest would be named AssumeTest and be part of the org.junit package.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat do you think about my proposal?</div>",
