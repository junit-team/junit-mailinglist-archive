Not again!&quot;\n\nHaving tags like that would promote the idea that you test methods. \nEven that you have test-methods that test production-methods and\ntest-classes that test production-classes.\n\nYou don&#39;t want to test methods, you want to test behaviour (which, of\ncourse, is done by calling methods).\n\nThat&#39;s not the way to use JUnit.  TestCase subclasses are for\npackagine a test fixture and the tests that run in the context of that\nfixture, not for collecting tests that test a spcecific class.\n\nThat may not be what you meant, but that&#39;s what it sounded like.\n\nDave\n\n\n",
