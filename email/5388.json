BaseTestRunner is the thing <br/>\nthat looks for the existence of a suite() method in a test.  If you <br/>\ncreate a TestSuite and pass a class that has a suite() method, the <br/>\nsuite() method is ignored and all the textXXX() methods are iterated <br/>\nto generate the suite.<br/>\n<br/>\nIs this intentional behavior?  I would think that TestSuite would be <br/>\nthe thing that looks for a suite() method.<br/>\n<br/>\nBoris</div>",
