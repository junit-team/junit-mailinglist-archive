My current plan is to first implement the <br/>\nbasic features of the new test runner and a UI for showing the test <br/>\nresults. That would demonstrate for example the concept of nested tests <br/>\nand what benefits there could be for having them as a first-class concept.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would begin thinking about a new test result format only after <br/>\nsomething which uses the test result data has been implemented. <br/>\nOtherwise it&#39;s easy to get stuck in endless speculation of what _might_ <br/>\nbe needed. I prefer starting from what is _really_ needed, and then <br/>\nthink about what is the best way to fulfill those concrete needs.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nEsko Luontola<br/>\nwww.orfjackal.net</div>",
