[mailto:rainsber@...]\n&gt; Sent: Wednesday, July 18, 2001 3:29 PM\n&gt; To: junit@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Subject: RE: [junit] RE: Why doesn&#39;t JUnit count asserts\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Understood, and thanks for bringing us back to the point of\n&gt; the thread. My\n&gt; final words on the subject: if management cares about how\n&gt; many assertions\n&gt; there are, then before long, so will the developers. If you\n&gt; don&#39;t want them\n&gt; to care, then you should consider finding a way for\n&gt; management to get the\n&gt; information they want without counting assertions.\n&gt;\n&gt; An interesting discussion.

The developers could care less.  Also, the\n&gt; developers didn&#39;t care exactly how many tests were written.\n&gt; What we wanted\n&gt; to know was that we had tested everything that could possibly\n&gt; break.
