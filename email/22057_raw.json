It would seem you gain the sam=\r\ne power by allowing any Class&lt;?&gt;. The advantage of doing this is it would a=\r\nllow real classes within the project to act as Categories, so that if, for =\r\nexample, I am testing a DAO framework, I can categorize individual tests wi=\r\nth the specific DAO subclass they are targeting, and then run a category ba=\r\nsed on the DAO supertype. Much nicer than just calling it all SlowTests. In=\r\n practice that won&#39;t happen often if a custom interface is required because=\r\n it will introduce a dependency on a JUnit type in the production code.\n\nI&#39;=\r\nm also curious if you considered using an annotation as the category? That =\r\nis having the category take a Class&lt;?&gt; that represents an annotation? You c=\r\nould support meta-annotations to allow a hierarchy of categories as well as=\r\n supporting any subclasses or implementations of types so annotated. Coding=\r\n for that would be nasty business, but it wouldn&#39;t be complicated from a cl=\r\nient point of view, and would allow the same flexibility of inheritance wit=\r\nhout the dependency on a JUnit type.\n\nI would prefer just an arbitrary Clas=\r\ns&lt;?&gt;, though. Inheritance is well understood by any Java programmer (unlike=\r\n meta-annotations) and opens up a synergy between the category hierarchy an=\r\nd the code hierarchy.\n\n--- In junit@yahoogroups.com, David Saff &lt;david@...&gt;=\r\n wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; All,\n&gt; \n&gt; There&#39;s a short post on the upcoming Categories featu=\r\nre of 4.8 here:\n&gt; \n&gt; http://saffgreenbar.blogspot.com/2009/11/heres-test-co=\r\nde-snippet-public.html\n&gt; \n&gt; Share and enjoy,\n&gt; \n&gt;    David Saff\n&gt;\n\n\n\n",
