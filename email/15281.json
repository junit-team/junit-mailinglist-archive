But don&#39;t make everything protected just because you think<br/>\n&gt; someone, somewhere might one day want to use it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I was certainly not advocating this, and I don&#39;t believe Kent was either.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaking *all* methods protected is just as dangerous as invoking YAGNI every<br/>\ntime to justify making *no* methods protected.<br/>\n<br/>\nI just have a fundamental dislike for knee-jerk reactions that drive design<br/>\nprinciples, and YAGNI is one of those.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t design with one liners, I use my brain and my experience to decide<br/>\nin every single case if such or such method should be protected.  Sometimes,<br/>\nI will indeed decide that I will probably not need it later, and other<br/>\ntimes, I will leave the door open for future extensions even though I can&#39;t<br/>\nreally see one myself just now.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIf the sheer size of<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; the resulting classes doesn&#39;t seem reason enough, then consider that you<br/>\n&gt; probably haven&#39;t designed the method correctly for extension in the<br/>\n&gt; first place.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You would probably be surprised by how well it works in practice.  Many<br/>\ntimes, I&#39;ve been able to pull off something very simple just because the<br/>\nauthor of the code I was using had the good idea to make that method<br/>\nprotected.<br/>\n<br/>\nAgain, my point to you is simply:  don&#39;t make YAGNI an absolute rule,<br/>\nbecause there are no absolute rules in development.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMethods provided in advance of an actual use case are<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; unlikely to fit the use cases that do arise.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>My experience is just the opposite.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  We can&#39;t all be experts in everything.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Exactly.  Hence,  making your methods protected is not always a bad<br/>\ndecision.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAgility accepts that we<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; don&#39;t know everything, we can&#39;t predict the future, we don&#39;t get<br/>\n&gt; anything right the first time<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Again:  all good arguments to use protected more often than not.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nCédric<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://testng.org\">http://testng.org</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",
