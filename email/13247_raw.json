Lots of discomfort using jUnit, is it\nonly me..:-(\n\nThough this is not my usecase. Do not get carried away by this\nexample..I am trying to sample a similar one..\nAssume the following heirarchy structure.. \nBizDoc = Performs versions/history relation functions.\nOrderDoc -&gt; BizDoc = Performs Order related functions.\nRequestDoc -&gt; BizDoc = Performs Request related functions.\nPurchaseOrder -&gt;OrderDoc = Performs PO specific functions.\nInvoice -&gt; OrderDoc = Performs Invoice specific functions.\nShipment -&gt; Orderdoc = Performs Shipment specific functions.\nAuction -&gt; RequestDoc = Performs auctions specific functions.\nPurchaseRequest -&gt; RequestDoc = Performs PR specific functions.\n\nI would prefer to organize my tests with a similar hierarchy structure\nto test the functions at the respective level.  Also I would like to\ninitialise the objects needed in the appropriate level for the childs\nto make use of them without doing them again.\n\nCurrently when PurchaseRequestUt and AuctionUt tests are run, it\nexecutes RequestDocUt tests as well BizDocUt tests twice which is\nunnecessary.\n\nI see two options .\n1. Have a single parent without testXXX methods do the on demand\ninitialisation at the top level and all Uts inherit from this single\nparent. And have Uts in a single level. In the above case BizDocUt &\nPurchaseRequestUt will be in the same level.  BizDocUt initialises\nsome objects in the helpers and make available for all Uts.  Or if\nPurchaseRequestUt is run first it initialises first all Bizdoc objects\nso that BizdocUt can run w/o initializing them again.\n\n2. Maintain the heirarchy of Ut and use the Test suite in all Ut\nclasses to add the child tests only.\n\nGuys - don&#39;t you feel this is a very common need for any OO\napplication.  I am surprised JUnit doesn&#39;t provided this flexibility\ndirectly.  I have posted my requirement for Logical flow of tests\nwhich is also good to have.  JUnit has these missing.  I can\nhack(override) into jUnit to support these but I do not want to\nmaintain this for every release.\n\nJUnit folks..are you hearing...?\n\n~JAK\nOn Apr 8, 2005 1:04 AM, J. B.

Some test\n&gt;  &gt; cases are run at the parent level and some are run at the child level.\n&gt;  &gt; My observation is this. When I run my child test cases it traverses\n&gt;  &gt; to the parent and runs the parent&#39;s tests also.  My question is this..\n&gt;  &gt; \n&gt;  &gt; #1. Can I stop my derived Unit tests from running parent tests.?\n&gt;  \n&gt;  Yes: collect the tests yourself with suite().\n&gt;  \n&gt;  &gt; #2. If I cannot stop them, can I run them in a specific order so that\n&gt;  &gt; parent tests and then child tests..?  One I could think of is add them\n&gt;  &gt; to the Test Suite in every derived Uts.\n&gt;  \n&gt;  You could use GSBase&#39;s OrderedTestSuite.\n&gt;  \n&gt;  A bigger question: if you don&#39;t want to inherit the tests, then why have \n&gt;  one test case class inherit from another? If it&#39;s to share utility \n&gt;  features, then I recommend pushing those out to another class that both \n&gt;  can use.\n&gt;  -- \n&gt;  J. B.
