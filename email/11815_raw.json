Typically, the name of the test is enough\n&gt;  &gt; to describe what each test means. Why is that not the case for you?\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;d like to share the result of my unit testing with upper\n&gt; management-type people.  testInsertTooLargeValue() doesn&#39;t mean much\n&gt; to them.  I&#39;d like a prose description like:  &quot;In this test, we try\n&gt; inserting a value into the table that is too large.  Depending on such\n&gt; and such, this should occur.  Or if not, then this should occur.  In\n&gt; either case, the code finally handlings this use case in blah blah\n&gt; blah manner.&quot;\n\nAha. I am wondering why upper management types are reading low-level \nprogrammer tests. Why do they want to read those tests?\n\nI am concerned with the expense of manually duplicating your test code \nin prose. If I knew what information they wanted, perhaps I could \nsuggest an alternative that is equally valuable to them, but much less \nprone to error than translating code into English by hand.\n\nHave you looked at Fit or FitNesse?\n-- \nJ.
