I could not compile the\ntests if my life depended on it, and I had my own test cases that\ncompiled over and over.\n\nI went to compile the newly created MapperTest.java and ran into this\nproblem:\n\nMapperTest.java [14.1] No method found matching run(Test)\n\tjunit.textui.TestRunner.run(suite());\nMapperTest.java [18.1] Incompatible type for return.\n\treturn new TestSuite(MapTest.class);\n2 errors\n\nNow, I did a search within this group for any hints why this would\noccur, since I&#39;ve never had the problem before. I have not found\nanything yet, but have found the solution. I thought I should share\nthe experience.\n\nWithin the same package as where the MapTest.java was, existed a\nTest.class (and Test.java). The developer&#39;s Test.class did not have\nthe appropriate run method, and therefore could not work.\n\nNot that anyone would ever have this problem starting out with junit,\nbut if you happen to take over code from developers and they&#39;ve\ncreated a Test.class within the package, just delete or rename the\nTest.class and all will go back into the green.\n\nHopefully this will help someone someday.\n\nTerry\n\n\n",
