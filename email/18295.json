That is why I suggested running as big part as possible outside the<br/>\ncontainer during developmenttime.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf running your tests often does not feel that important then by all means<br/>\nrun them inside a container. I&#39;m currently working with weblogic and I can&#39;t<br/>\nimagine TDD:ing if I would need to deploy my new code in the container in<br/>\norder to run my tests. It is simply too tedious. In my case 95% of the code<br/>\nhas nothing to do with EJB:s whatsoever so i don&#39;t see that much added value<br/>\nof executing the unittests inside the container.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat is just my opinion and also the reason why i don&#39;t know the answer to<br/>\nhow to run the tests inside the container. I never did it. Maybe it is<br/>\neasier in other containers.<br/>\n<br/>\n/J<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On 11/2/06, Cédric Beust ♔ &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:cbeust@...\">cbeust@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   On 11/2/06, Joakim Ohlrogge &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:joakim.ohlrogge@...\">joakim.ohlrogge@...</a>&lt;joakim.ohlrogge%40gmail.com&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Extract as much as possible to classes that can be tested outside of the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; application server.

I&#39;m not convinced that it is a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; good idea to use those frameworks. I never felt had the need.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I think in those cases deploy your application and run your tests as a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; client. Perhaps using FIT or some other acceptance-testing framework.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Those<br/>\n&gt; &gt; tests are typically run more seldomly than your unit-tests.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; This is just my opinion on a way forward. I&#39;m sure those who disagree<br/>\n&gt; will<br/>\n&gt; &gt; speak up soon :)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; There is no reason why you can&#39;t run your tests inside your container, and<br/>\n&gt; if you are going to test an application that runs inside a container, it&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; probably wise to run your tests there as well. The easiest way is probably<br/>\n&gt; to package your tests in their own application (or bundle them with the<br/>\n&gt; application you are trying to test) and run them as a regular Java EE<br/>\n&gt; application.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --<br/>\n&gt; Cédric<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed] </span></blockquote></div>",
