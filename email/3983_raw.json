Making=\r\n setUp and tearDown final is not quite as\nimportant to me, as long as they =\r\nget run.  You could let the Concrete\nTests override them but you would have=\r\n to have a way to ensure that the\noverriden versions call super().  You cou=\r\nld use set a flag in the\nabstract test&#39;s setUp and then fail if you don&#39;t s=\r\nee the flag at the\nbeginning of each test.\n\nI have actually been using the =\r\ncreateXXX abstract method to do any\ninitialization specific to the Concrete=\r\n Test.  Sometimes that looks a\nlittle clumsy to me, so using a non-final se=\r\ntUp method may be the better\nlong term solution.\n\nOn Wed, 2002-02-06 at 10:=\r\n12, Francois Beausoleil wrote:\n    Hello Eric,\n    \n    I have been doing s=\r\nomething similar.
