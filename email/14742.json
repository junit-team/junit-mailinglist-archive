I think it could have been avoided by better packaging. In<br/>\nfact, as Robert already pointed out, it&#39;s easy to exclude packages from<br/>\nJavaDoc.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Has it been that long since you learned a new API?<br/>\n&gt; Featuritis isn&#39;t just a problem for applications. It applies to<br/>\n&gt; libraries too. Smaller is better. Too large an API becomes a problem.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>If I find a package with the name &quot;internal&quot; in it, I&#39;d never come to the<br/>\nconclusion that it is one I should look at.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Trying to bring this back on topic, the JUnit 3.8 API is a good<br/>\n&gt; example. It&#39;s actually pretty small but not as small as it could or<br/>\n&gt; should be. Take a look at<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.junit.org/junit/javadoc/3.8.1/index.htm\">http://www.junit.org/junit/javadoc/3.8.1/index.htm</a> How much of that<br/>\n&gt; does a programmer actually need to know?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Mainly the content of junit.framework. Doesn&#39;t look hard to find out to me.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; How easy is it for someone<br/>\n&gt; trying to learn the API to figure what they need to do and where to<br/>\n&gt; get started? Even experienced users can have trouble finding a<br/>\n&gt; relatively unfamiliar class, and that&#39;s a small API as APIs go, and<br/>\n&gt; much better documented than most.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t remember having that problem, or having it seen mentioned on the<br/>\nmailing list often.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Probably half of what&#39;s there could<br/>\n&gt; be non-public, and users would be the better off for it if it were.<br/>\n&gt; What benefit is served by making junit.samples or TestResult$1<br/>\n&gt; public?  <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t see the problem you seem to see. I never had a problem with the<br/>\nJunit API.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers, Ilja</div>",
