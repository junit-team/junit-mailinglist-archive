    "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-519758968\">I&#39;d like to add that even though some code may seem simpler if it is not<br/>\nwritten with tests in mind, that still doesn&#39;t seem like a good enough<br/>\nexcuse for not writing testable code.  After all, lots of things seem<br/>\ncomplicated to novices, but what we&#39;re talking about here is actually making<br/>\nthings simpler:  the tests.  They may not appear simpler, but they are, in<br/>\nthe sense that it&#39;s easier to test things.  This translates into code that&#39;s<br/>\nmore robust, since the tests can find more problems.  In my opinion, testing<br/>\nis a requirement, not a &quot;nice-to-have&quot;, and thus making the tests simpler<br/>\nshould be part of the design.<br/>\n<br/>\nMark<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Mike Clark [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mike@...\">mike@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: June 4, 2001 7:47 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [junit] Method Chains, was Re: Testing private methods<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMatt Caswell wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt;&gt; From: Mike Clark [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mike@...\">mike@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Sent: 01 June 2001 21:02<br/>\n&gt;&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt;&gt; Subject: Re: [junit] Method Chains, was Re: Testing private methods<br/>\n&gt;&gt; <br/>\n&gt;&gt; <br/>\n&gt;&gt; <br/>\n&gt;&gt; <br/>\n&gt;&gt; Steve Freeman wrote:<br/>\n&gt;&gt; <br/>\n&gt;&gt; <br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; From: &quot;Matt Caswell&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:m.caswell@...\">m.caswell@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; <br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; circumstances. However I think I would be reluctant to <br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; <br/>\n&gt;&gt; change the way my<br/>\n&gt;&gt; <br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; <br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; code was implemented just so that I could test it, as some <br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; <br/>\n&gt;&gt; of the other<br/>\n&gt;&gt; <br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; <br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; <br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; <br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; My experience is different. I&#39;ve found that changing my <br/>\n&gt;&gt; <br/>\n&gt;&gt; coding style to make it testable (which doesn&#39;t mean just <br/>\n&gt;&gt; putting in lots of unnecessary accessors) also makes it <br/>\n&gt;&gt; better. The more I apply this to different targets, such as <br/>\n&gt;&gt; shell scripts, the more I&#39;m convinced. <br/>\n&gt;&gt; <br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; <br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; <br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Steve<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; <br/>\n&gt;&gt; <br/>\n&gt;&gt; I concur.  I&#39;ve found that testable code exhibits certain composable <br/>\n&gt;&gt; properties that foster interface-based design.  For example, the <br/>\n&gt;&gt; assembly of a few simple objects to perform a more complex <br/>\n&gt;&gt; task allows <br/>\n&gt;&gt; any of the objects to be mocked.  In turn, by refactoring designs to <br/>\n&gt;&gt; extract complex static relationships into interface-based <br/>\n&gt;&gt; compositions, <br/>\n&gt;&gt; the design becomes more open to extension, but closed to <br/>\n&gt;&gt; modification. <br/>\n&gt;&gt; So, I&#39;ll up the ante and claim that designs may change as a <br/>\n&gt;&gt; side effect <br/>\n&gt;&gt; of writing tests.  This is the essence of test-first design.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; <br/>\n&gt;&gt; Mike<br/>\n&gt;&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; If these are indeed compex relationships then it may well be the case that<br/>\n&gt; refactoring the code is an appropriate course of action. Not all<br/>\n&gt; relationships *are* complex! In my experience it is better to keep the<br/>\n </span></blockquote>code<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; simple where ever possible.

Toward that end, if through testing <br/>\nthe code a simpler design takes form, then all the better.  The point is <br/>\nthat testing may be the catalyst for rethinking the design, and <br/>\nrefactoring the code, to better serve the intended clients.  In other <br/>\nwords, there can be a positive feedback loop between design, coding, and <br/>\ntesting.<br/>\n<br/>\nMike<br/>\n-- <br/>\nMike Clark<br/>\nClarkware Consulting, Inc.<br/>\nCustom Software Architecture, Design,<br/>\nDevelopment, and Performance Consulting<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.clarkware.com\">http://www.clarkware.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nTo unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\">junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nYour use of Yahoo!
