I will start not by talking about Agitator, but\n&gt; about a more general issue: is there a problem with unit testing that\n&gt; needs solving?\n&gt;\n&gt; You write:\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; The bottom line is that this is a very interesting product that\n&gt;&gt; appears to me to be looking for a problem to solve.\n&gt;\n&gt; I believe that there&#39;s a HUGE and GROWING problem to solve.  My\n&gt; co-founder (Dr. Roongko Doong, another person who is as passionate\n&gt; about advancing the state-of-the-art in test automation for 15+\n&gt; years), started Agitar not because we were looking for something to\n&gt; do, or make a quick buck (quite the contrary, in 2002 when we started\n&gt; Agitar I was Senior Director of Software Engineering at Google - if\n&gt; all I cared about was money I would have stayed put :-)).\n\nLet me be clear.  There was an old joke in the &#39;60s about the Laser  \nbeing a solution in search of a problem.  I was making an oblique  \nreference to that old joke, and not a snide remark about  \ncommercialism.  I think the agitation technology is very cool.  I&#39;m  \njust wondering what problem it solves.\n\nI agree with you that there is a huge and growing problem in software  \nquality, and that test automation is the solution to that problem.   \nI&#39;m just perplexed about how Agitar addresses that issue.\n\n&gt; We started\n&gt; Agitar to solve what I believe is one of the biggest problems in\n&gt; software development, and one that we are very passionate about:\n&gt; getting developers to think about and do testing DURING development -\n&gt; so they can address defects and design problems with maximum\n&gt; efficiency and minimum impact.  As opposed to the more traditional\n&gt; &quot;throw the code over the wall to QA&quot; model.\n\nI completely agree that the over-the-wall method is broken.  I think  \nit&#39;s broken for many reasons.\n\n1. Tests are done at the end of the schedule when there&#39;s no time  \nleft (because all the slack has been eaten up by the developers.)\n\n2. Manual tests are very costly, time consuming, and error prone;  \nespecially when they come at the end and are under schedule pressure.\n\n3. Tests that come at the end are based on the *current* execution of  \nthe program rather than on the true requirements.  This is a bizarre  \nbreak in encapsulation which tends to let the implementation drive  \nthe requirements.\n\n&gt; My experience at Google, where with others I championed the\n&gt; introduction of JUnit and the idea of developer testing was very\n&gt; revealing.  Admittedly, Google is a way off the chart in terms of\n&gt; programming talent,\n\nAnd way off the charts in assisting repressive nations.\n\n&gt; but in the last 4 years I confirmed the very same\n&gt; findings with 100s of other people and software organizations that\n&gt; also introduced, or tried to introduce, developer/unit testing:\n&gt;\n&gt; Here are some of the key things I discovered:\n&gt;\n&gt; 1) On average, approximately only 30% of developers who are introduced\n&gt; to xUnit/developer-testing/TDD become test-infected (i.e. the will\n&gt; continue to do unit testing even if they are not asked to).  The other\n&gt; 70% will go back to their &quot;old-ways&quot;.  Why is that?  My next points\n&gt; sheds some light.\n&gt;\n&gt; 2) Most developer complained that in order to get decent coverage (say\n&gt; 80-90%) they have to write 3-4 lines of JUnit code for every line of\n&gt; Java.  They wanted some way to automate the most mundane parts of the\n&gt; testing effort and retain control of the areas that require human\n&gt; intelligence, insight, domain-knowledge, and creativity.\n&gt;\n&gt; 3) Most of the unit tests that actually get written cover only the\n&gt; normal/&quot;happy&quot; path.  They assume the best of all possible world; that\n&gt; they would never be passed bad parameters, that all strings would be\n&gt; nice ASCII code and never exceed some magic length, that all objects\n&gt; will be well formed and in the state they were expecting, etc.\n&gt; Needless to say, this is not sufficient for most industrial\n&gt; applications, especially if they have to survive in hostile\n&gt; environments where hackers look for every possible deficiency in the\n&gt; system, or when your colleagues assume that you are going to handle\n&gt; those null pointers so he does not have to worry about them. On the\n&gt; other hand, if you want to cover all those contingencies testing\n&gt; becomes a combinatorial problem and it&#39;s hard for developers to\n&gt; conceive of and test for everything that should be tested for.\n&gt;\n&gt; 4) If testing a particular piece of code was too complicated (lots of\n&gt; dependencies, complicated set-up, lots of things to mock, etc.) the\n&gt; tests were skipped.  This is human nature. Ideally people would look\n&gt; at code that&#39;s difficult to test and think re-factoring and (re)design\n&gt; for testability but most people are not there yet.\n&gt;\n&gt; 5) Test maintenance was as time consuming as code maintenance.  If\n&gt; there&#39;s anything that most developers disliked more than writing lots\n&gt; of test code by hand, was maintaining that code.  One of the most\n&gt; common unit test maintenance patterns is: delete or comment-out\n&gt; failing tests.\n\nMy solution to all these &quot;problems&quot; is to re-educate the developers  \nand fire the ones who don&#39;t realize that they can&#39;t release untested  \ncode.  This seems to me to be a matter of professional ethics.  I  \nhave no sympathy for whining software developers who don&#39;t want to  \nwrite tests.  What they are really whining about is that they don&#39;t  \nwant to be responsible for making their code work.\n\nWriting tests first (i.e. true TDD) solves most of the problems  \nmentioned above except the discipline problem.  Pink slips solve that  \nproblem.  (I&#39;m dead serious about this.  You don&#39;t test, you don&#39;t  \nwork. Period.)\n\nUsing TDD you can&#39;t write production code unless you write a failing  \nunit test first.  Thus you will get very high coverage (80-90), and  \nyou won&#39;t write code that&#39;s hard to test, because you write the tests  \nfirst.\n\nRefactoring solves the test maintenance problem.  Tests are not  \nsecond class citizens.  They have to be kept to the same standard of  \ncleanliness and design as production code.  Therefore we refactor  \nthem to keep them easy to modify.\n&gt;\n&gt; So, for someone who believes that developer/unit testing is the right\n&gt; thing to do - one of the MOST important things to do and do WELL - I\n&gt; saw a VERY big and VERY definite problem.  Namely: Most developers\n&gt; want and need help with their testing effort.  Without some help and\n&gt; automation they will either give up on developer/unit testing or, even\n&gt; worse because it gives a false sense of security, write some trivial\n&gt; &quot;happy-path&quot; tests that pass too easily and fail to cover some\n&gt; critical conditions.\n\nAgain, developers who have the attitude that it is OK to give up on  \ntesting need their attitude readjusted -- and fast!  I have no  \nproblem with tools to help with this; but the first problem to solve  \nis the attitude problem.\n\nAlso, one of my problems with the Agitar tool is that it can&#39;t seem  \nto see very far into a function.  Therefore the observations it makes  \nare naive, thus possibly reinforcing the &quot;false sense of security&quot;  \nyou talked about.\n\n&gt; Note that I am not in favor of complete\n&gt; automation (press a button get some passing tests) unless you need\n&gt; some quick change detector. I want Agitator to do for software\n&gt; developers what spreadsheets have done for accountants and business\n&gt; people: raise the level of abstraction, allow the user to focus on the\n&gt; important things that require their intelligence and understanding\n&gt; (e.g. formulae in spreadsheets, test data/assertions in Agitator),\n&gt; provide a number of other related utilities (e.g. graphs in\n&gt; spreadsheets, code coverage and code rules and dashboard reports in\n&gt; Agitator).\n\nI like the code coverage aspects of Agitar.  Some of the graphs and  \ncharts are very useful.  I have no problems with them at all.\n&gt;\n&gt; We could argue whether Agitator helps with some of the problems (I\n&gt; believe it does since it was designed to address them specifically),\n&gt; but I don&#39;t think we can argue that there is no problem to be solved\n&gt; when it comes to developer testing.  Until most developers and\n&gt; software development organizations practice thorough unit testing on a\n&gt; consistent basis, we have a problem.\n\nAgreed.  And tool support is important.  Education is even more  \nimportant.  There is a minimum level of professional ethics involved  \nhere, and every developer needs to learn it.\n\nI wear a green wrist band that says &quot;Test First&quot;.  It is a symbol of  \nmy commitment to this minmium level of professional ethics.  I WILL  \nTEST MY CODE.\n&gt;\n&gt; Without JUnit we would not be where we are today.  A 30% test\n&gt; infection rate is a huge step from what it was before (i.e. ~0%).  But\n&gt; I refuse believe that we cannot augment and provide developers with\n&gt; other tools beyond JUnit, and that we are stuck at 30% test infected.\n\nI agree.  And I think JUnit was partially responsible for this.   \nHowever I also think that the revolution would have happened without  \nthe tool -- causing the tool to be written anyway.\n&gt;\n&gt; There&#39;s work we all have left to do.\n&gt;\n&gt; People like you are helping our common cause doing what you do best\n&gt; and, presumably, like to do best: training, coaching, mentoring,\n&gt; educating, writing, etc.\n&gt;\n&gt; Me?  I am a software tool maker.  That&#39;s what I do best, and that&#39;s\n&gt; what I like to do. That&#39;s the best way I can help the cause.  I\n&gt; believe that tools are critical to progress, and that the right tools\n&gt; will enable the right behavior.  Anyone who knows me, or has talked\n&gt; with me for just a few minutes, knows how passionate I am about\n&gt; solving this problem (if we agree that there is a problem :-)) and I\n&gt; also would like to think that in addition to my passion, I bring some\n&gt; unique experience, skills, and vision to the table.\n\nAnd I appreciate that!  I think we need more and better tools for  \nsoftware development.  My problem is that I just don&#39;t know if the  \nAgitation features of Agitar are really particularly useful.   \nMoreover I fear a tool that can figure out tests for you may give  \ndevelopers an excuse not to write their own tests; especially if it  \nis marketed to managers and developers as a way to reduce unit test  \nwriting time.\n\n\n----\nRobert C.
