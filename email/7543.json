I&#39;m not sure what a &quot;session facade&quot; has to do with a &quot;session&quot;. I call it &quot;Business Logic Gateway&quot;. I can&#39;t remember what Martin Fowler calls it in his book.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo said Mike Clark on 4/4/2003 --------------------<br/>\nJ. B.

They are hacks designed to increase performance and work around the obvious limitations and faulty intentions of J2EE.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Session facade is not a &quot;pattern&quot; in the sense of &quot;improves design&quot;. It is a hack that gets around the fact that J2EE tries to hide RMI from the programmer. If we didn&#39;t have to worry about remote objects, then how would we design it? I don&#39;t think we&#39;d arrive at these implementation idioms/hacks if it weren&#39;t for working around either remote objects or a persistence mechanism that tries to call &quot;save&quot; for every method call.<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>IMO, it&#39;s a pattern in the sense that it is a common solution to a <br/>\nreoccurring problem in distributed computing.  By naming it, we <br/>\nestablish a common vocabulary for recognizing and debating the problem. <br/>\nMoreover, I believe session facade does improve design.  It decouples <br/>\nremote clients from persistent objects, perhaps modeled as entity beans, <br/>\nand encapsulates business logic in a cohesive location.  That is, it&#39;s a <br/>\nlayering technique to separate concerns and manage dependencies.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOne person&#39;s pattern is another person&#39;s hack.<br/>\n<br/>\nMike<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nMike Clark<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://clarkware.com\">http://clarkware.com</a><br/>\n(303) 589-3812<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYahoo!
