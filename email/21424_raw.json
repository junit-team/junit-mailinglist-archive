I work at a company that makes Medical Devices. The FDA, as w=\r\ne&#39;re told by QA, requires the deposition of all tests. So even Pass&#39;ing tes=\r\nts must have their actual results reported on. We do this currently with ma=\r\nnual/human tests.\n\nIf the report could say something like:\nTest ID Status E=\r\nxpected        Actual\n123       Pass  Smith           Smith\n456       Pass =\r\n Value &gt; 10      12\n789       Fail  Value =3D &quot;abc&quot;   xyz\n...\n\nThis report =\r\nwould be stored (for many years) for audit purposes.\n\nNow being a newbie, m=\r\naybe there is a way to do this I don&#39;t know about - but very useful.\n\nMark\n=\r\n\n\n--- In junit@yahoogroups.com, &quot;toalexsmail&quot; &lt;toalexsmail@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; =\r\n--- In junit@yahoogroups.com, Robert Wenner &lt;robert.wenner@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n On Monday 09 June 2008 21:18, C=E9dric Beust  wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If I have to =\r\ngo through umpteen thousand lines of log, I may as well\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; test everyt=\r\nhing manually.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Nobody says you have to, but the fact that your =\r\ntests pass doesn&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; &gt; guarantee that you are testing what you think you =\r\nare testing.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Well. If the log is important, I have to go through i=\r\nt, or I miss \n&gt; &gt; something important. If it is not important (and I don&#39;t =\r\nhave to go \n&gt; &gt; through it) I can skip it altogether. So what do you mean w=\r\nhen you\n&gt; say I \n&gt; &gt; don&#39;t have to go through it?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; I have read car=\r\nefully all the posts so far and I tend to agree with\n&gt; Robert. I am wonder =\r\nwhether I miss something important too.\n&gt; I want to be clear, so I will tak=\r\ne one step backward. What is the MAIN\n&gt; purpose of JUnit? The answer is to =\r\nbe able to write AUTOMATIC unit\n&gt; test. Unit test should be written is the =\r\ncorrect way, that is\n&gt; correctly design. This has nothing to do with loggin=\r\ng. Making unit\n&gt; test AUTOMATIC contradict using logging.\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;you can ski=\r\np the this paragraph&gt;\n&gt; I want to step aside for a while. Let assume that y=\r\nou&#39;re not using\n&gt; JUnit at all and write small main function to test. I don=\r\n&#39;t want to\n&gt; counter why you shouldn&#39;t do this, let focus on what tools you=\r\n do use\n&gt; in this approach. In the most cases you will add System.out both =\r\nto\n&gt; the code and to the main. If you&#39;re using C++, for instance, you will\n=\r\n&gt; use preprocessor to switch on or off these output to the console. More\n&gt; =\r\nadvance option will be to use logging mechanism and to change it\n&gt; configur=\r\nation depends on the environment your program run (that is to\n&gt; turn on man=\r\ny of your log statement only in development). Everything is\n&gt; great until y=\r\nour program is actually fails. Again, from the experience\n&gt; it is almost al=\r\nways the case that existing System.outs are not enough,\n&gt; that you need mor=\r\ne information or you should add some more output\n&gt; early in the code. So, i=\r\nn this point you have to option to run your\n&gt; program AGAIN with debugger o=\r\nr to add more System.outs and to run it\n&gt; as is. In both cases it can be th=\r\ne case that you should rerun your\n&gt; program again (if you use debugger you =\r\ncould simply not pointed out\n&gt; when some data changed and in the System.out=\r\n case you can figure out\n&gt; that you need more System.outs).\n&gt; \n&gt; From the p=\r\naragraph above one should conclude that when one write unit\n&gt; test there is=\r\n 2 different phases. First is to write them down in the\n&gt; hope that everyth=\r\ning will be ok (it doesn&#39;t mean, that you design\n&gt; should be poor or you sh=\r\nouldn&#39;t supply appropriate messages to assert\n&gt; statements etc) and the sec=\r\nond phase is to rerun your test if your\n&gt; test fails. Lets see how logging =\r\nwill help you.\n&gt; \n&gt; In the first phase I see the only purpose using logs is=\r\n for &#39;sanity\n&gt; check&#39; that is to ensure that you actually test what your th=\r\nink is you\n&gt; test. If you want to make something more than just &#39;sanity che=\r\nck&#39; you\n&gt; should write unit test to your unit test, that is pretty silly.\n&gt;=\r\n Moreover, you need to make such &#39;sanity check&#39; only when you actually\n&gt; wr=\r\nite this test.  For this purpose logging is appropriate approach, IMHO.\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; In the second phase, when you rerun your unit test when it fails, you\n&gt; s=\r\nhould consider to add more assert statement and more clearly\n&gt; diagnostic m=\r\nessages first. When you done and you don&#39;t see how to\n&gt; improve the design =\r\n(recall I consider that design is correct) you can\n&gt; add log statement manu=\r\nally. But in this case they will not be part of\n&gt; new mechanism, because no=\r\n more asserts will be added. So this new\n&gt; feature will not be in use!\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n Using logging in the assert statement ONLY for &#39;sanity check&#39; is\n&gt; overkil=\r\nl, I think. As for me I make such &#39;sanity check&#39; in the\n&gt; following way. Fi=\r\nrst of all, I use log4j MANUALLY that is as addition\n&gt; to JUnit asserts. Th=\r\ney don&#39;t duplicate what asserts does they supply\n&gt; additional information, =\r\nsuch as what assertion was already done. In\n&gt; this case when assertion will=\r\n fail afterwards I can look on the log to\n&gt; see in what part of unit test i=\r\nt happened and what tests passed. I go\n&gt; even further and use JDK 1.4 asser=\r\nt statement to document\n&gt; precondition, postcondition and invariants both i=\r\nn the code and in the\n&gt; unit test.\n&gt; \n&gt; The bottom line is that I see the s=\r\nense using logs as a COMPLETION to\n&gt; the JUnit and only for &#39;sanity check&#39;.=\r\n This use is not duplicates\n&gt; JUnit assert statements and could be written =\r\nmanually.\n&gt;\n\n\n\n",
