Further, I would argue that I _NEED_ to remove them. <br/>\n <br/>\n&gt; Now, maybe I am old-fashioned but I believe tests (at least at the <br/>\n&gt; unit/programmer level) ought to be as autonomous as possible.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve heard that argument several times, and it sounds reasonable, but <br/>\nstill I don&#39;t understand completely. I think the best way to present my <br/>\nconfusion is to show to you an example where I think it would be perfectly <br/>\nreasonable to not run some tests, because I know the _will_ fail if one <br/>\nother fails:<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m developing a system that handles (among others, but quite extensively) <br/>\npersistence of java objects to a database. I&#39;ve built test cases for some <br/>\n(far too few, but that&#39;s another problem) of the functionality, most of <br/>\nwhich of course need a properly configured Database conection. Now I also <br/>\ngot a test that checks to see if the system can successfully connect to <br/>\nthe database. If this case fails then there are about 130 other tests that <br/>\nwill not produce anything useable. It would probably be possible to mock <br/>\nthe Database, but I can&#39;t really imagine how (without makeing the Mock so <br/>\nunstable, that it won&#39;t help).<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat would you do about these tests in this case? Or am I talking about <br/>\nsomething completely different?<br/>\n<br/>\nregards<br/>\nJoachim Sauer<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",
