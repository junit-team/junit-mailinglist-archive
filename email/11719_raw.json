The\nmost of the test cases are passed but few of them\nfailed due to the following error message.\n\nError in executing stored procedure ORA-00942: table\nor view does not exist\n\nActions we have taken to resolve this problem,\n\n1. we have asked DBA people to restart the DB server\n(As a result, all test cases are passed. But this is\nnot permanent solution as sometimes we are getting the\nsame error).\n\n\nFew more points,\n1.There is no DDL operation performed against database\nwhile we are executing test cases.\n2.Only one user is connected to the particular\nschema(Database schema) (No other users are connected)\n\nCould you please give me some tips on how to resolve\nthis problem?\n\n\nThanks & Regards,\nK.Barath\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nTired of spam?
