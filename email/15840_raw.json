I am going to begin by examining the suggestion\n&gt; in Friday, January 20, 2006 1:41 PM about setUp/tearDown.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;rarely the best one&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; It all depend on how you define &quot;best&quot;.\n&gt; \n&gt; If I am running tests on my PC and don&#39;t have a lot of time to delve into\n&gt; the memory problem, why not add that 1 GB of memory to the PC and meet the\n&gt; deliverable date ?\n\nThis is precisely the kind of thinking that leads to dissatisfied \ncustomers. Are /they/ going to just pop in 1 GB RAM to run your \nsoftware? A memory problem in testing often means a memory problem in \nthe production code.\n\n&gt; If this is an exercise to learn the technology, then I would investigate\n&gt; setUp/tearDown, lazy loading and so on.\n\nI think it&#39;s one of our basic responsibilities as programmers to take \nreasonable precautions against writing software that arbitrarily sucks \nup large amounts of memory. I assume, of course, that we intend our \ncustomers to let our software run for days, weeks, months at a time.\n-- \nJ. B.
