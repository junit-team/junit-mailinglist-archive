Further down in the same method body\nit resolves the class:\n\nif (resolve)\n\tresolveClass(c);\nreturn c;\n\nThe method wants to check to see if the class should be\nexcluded before loading and resolving it. Otherwise, other classes\nthat the class depends upon might be loaded, but which cannot\nbe unloaded if the class is subsequently excluded by JUnit&#39;s class\nexclusion list.\n\n&lt;off-topic&gt;\nIf you really want to write your own JUnit class loader I would\nrecommend that you write it from scratch, and create an implementation\nthat only overrides ClassLoader.findClass(String name), specifying\nthe classes you want to include rather than classes you want to exclude.\nKeep the system CLASSPATH set to just the classes you need for your test\nrunner and nothing else. This would align your class loader to Sun\nrecommendations on such things. I don&#39;t know why JUnit&#39;s class loading\nis written the way it is, perhaps someone could enlighten me, but I\nexpect it is because the code pre-dates JDK 1.2, when the Java class\nloading model was no as stable.\n&lt;/off-topic&gt;\n\nMalcolm\n\n\nOn Sun, 2003-09-14 at 22:33, David Vydra wrote:\n&gt; I was writing a reloading console runner and had to make the following\n&gt; change in order to make it work.
