I understand you to be saying that you don&#39;t use IDEs, at \n&gt; least not\n&gt; all the time, and you would like a friendlier presentation of test results\n&gt; than what is available from the textual test runner.\n&gt;\n&gt; Our thinking about the role of graphical runners in the base JUnit release\n&gt; evolved in a couple of steps. First, we noticed that JUnit depended on AWT\n&gt; and Swing classes even though those classes didn&#39;t seem central to the\n&gt; framework. This is an aesthetic point, but aesthetics often lead us in the\n&gt; right direction so we trust them. Breaking this dependency required \n&gt; breaking\n&gt; JUnit into two parts, core and UI. Once we had broken JUnit up we came to\n&gt; the second step of deciding who should be responsible for the UI. Ant and\n&gt; the IDEs already have their own user interface and represent the (vast?)\n&gt; majority of JUnit usage, so there is little value added by maintaining\n&gt; separate UIs. With our limited time to support JUnit, it didn&#39;t make sense\n&gt; to continue maintaining the graphical runners ourselves.\n&gt;\n&gt; We aren&#39;t against standalone runners in general. One of our goals with \n&gt; JUnit\n&gt; 4 is to make writing runners easier. However, we seldom have code in the\n&gt; JUnit distribution that we didn&#39;t write and there is a widely established\n&gt; community of JUnit extenders. Because of this we are comfortable \n&gt; letting go\n&gt; of the graphical runners and encouraging people to write and publish their\n&gt; own. If there is anything more we can do to aid in this endeavor, \n&gt; please let\n&gt; us know.\n\nFair enough... as I said I would just like to see a graphical runner \neasily available (on the junit.org site perhaps, as Todd Bradley \nsuggested).  If I find time soon, I will write it myself and see about \npublishing it.  I completely understand about the unwillingness to \nmaintain such a thing as well as the Core of JUnit.\n\n-- \nJason Rogers\n\n&quot;I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I,\nbut Christ liveth in me: and the life which I now live in \nthe flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved \nme, and gave himself for me.&quot;\n    Galatians 2:20\n\n\n",
