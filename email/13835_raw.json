This makes it easy to\n&gt;  &gt; run localised tests.\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; In my experience, it doesn&#39;t. It does, however, make it\n&gt;  &gt; /look/ like it&#39;s  easy to find tests that may be affected\n&gt;  &gt; by a feature change. You really  don&#39;t know until you run\n&gt;  &gt; the tests, anyway.\n&gt; \n&gt; Yes. I don&#39;t advocate the &quot;test class per production class&quot;\n&gt; pattern. However, that&#39;s the reason I keep being given when\n&gt; I suggest introducing new test classes.\n&gt; \n\n&gt; One smell I hate is setup code that&#39;s only used for a few\n&gt; tests in a test class; that&#39;s something asking to be split\n&gt; up into multiple test classes.\n\nYes. Even worse: two possibly overlapping, but often disjoint, sets of \ntest fixture objects in the same test case class. Some tests use fixture \nA and others use fixture B. Why not put those in separate test case \nclasses for clarity?\n\nI wonder whether _xUnit Automation Patterns_ plans to talk about issues \nlike these. If not, then I should consider writing a few more recipes.\n-- \nJ. B.
