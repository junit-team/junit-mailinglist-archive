The change log is below.\n\nShare and Enjoy,\n\nTeam JUnit\nSummary of Changes with version 4.3\n\n\n   - Changes in array equality. Using assertEquals to compare array\n   contents is now deprecated. In the future, assertEquals will revert to\n   its pre-4.0 meaning of comparing objects based on Java&#39;s\nObject.equalssemantics. To compare array contents, use the new, more\nreliable\n   Assert.assertArrayEquals methods.\n   - The @Ignore annotation can now be applied to classes, to ignore the\n   entire class, instead of individual methods.\n   - Originally, developers who wanted to use a static suite() method\n   from JUnit 3.x with a JUnit 4.x runner had to annotate the class with\n   @RunWith(AllTests.class). In the common case, this requirement has\n   been removed. However, when such a class is wrapped with a JUnit4TestAdapter\n   (which we believe is rare), the results may not be as expected.\n   - Improved error messages for array comparison(&quot;arrays first differed\n   at element [1][0]&quot;)\n   - Bug fix: Inaccessible base class is caught at test construction\n   time.\n   - Bug fix: Circular suites are caught at test construction time.\n   - Bug fix: Test constructors that throw exceptions are reported\n   correctly.\n   - *For committers and extenders*\n      - Sources now are in a separate &quot;src&quot; directory (this means a\n      big break in the CVS history)\n      - Improved documentation in Request, RunWith\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n",
