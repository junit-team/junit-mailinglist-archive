    "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-404352717\">The server and client should probably be tested separatly.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne school of thought is that that you should abstract out the transport level <br/>\ncode into implementations of an interface you define, letting your provide <br/>\nsimple mock implementations to test against.  This allows you to test the <br/>\nlogic of your code without actually using the network at anypoint, giving you <br/>\na lot of fine control over what happens when.  Plus it encourages you to <br/>\nfactor out the transport level stuff which is a Good Thing (tm) anyway.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe approach I took last time I tried (before I&#39;d got my head around the above <br/>\nidea, being a JUnit novice at the time myself) was to consider the unit <br/>\ntesting as testing the public interface of the class, with the network calls <br/>\nbeing part of that interface.  To aid this kind of testing I wrote a simple <br/>\nNetworkTester class that enabled simple send/expect conversations to be <br/>\ncarried out from either a server, or clients perspective.  <br/>\nThe advantage of this is that you often expose some of the subtle networking <br/>\nrelated problems that you might not see until production or (hopefully) <br/>\nstress testing.  Whether it counts as unit testing or not is maybe debatable.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope this makes some kinda sense.<br/>\nShez<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Tuesday 21 May 2002 9:49 am, Jason Novotny wrote:<br/>\n&gt; In my codebase, I have a simple client and server that should work if<br/>\n&gt; the server receives a hello message from the client and then echos back<br/>\n&gt; to the client.
