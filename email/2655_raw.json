(Granted, one could debate these are \n    &gt; functional\n    &gt; tests, but that&#39;s beside the point).\n    &gt; \n    &gt; Can any one shed any light on how I can A) start up the \n    &gt; mail server\n    &gt; prior to running the test part of the build, and B) how to verify\n    &gt; that the server is still running, when a test is started?\n    &gt; \n    &gt; Once running, I usually leave the mail server running all \n    &gt; the time,\n    &gt; but sometimes I forget to start it and then run my tests and some\n    &gt; of the tests fail. Hence the desire to start the server \n    &gt; and test if\n    &gt; the server is still running as part of the Ant build.\n    &gt; \n    &gt; Later, I&#39;d like to setup CruiseControl (once I figure it \n    &gt; out...) to\n    &gt; do a nightly build and test of the software. I&#39;ve just started\n    &gt; playing with Ant, CVS, CruiseControl, TomCat, etc. and \n    &gt; there&#39;s alot\n    &gt; to absorb, so any suggestions would be very appreciated!\n    &gt; \n    &gt; \n    &gt; PCM (Paul Michali)\n    &gt; \n    &gt; Carrier Voice Gateway Business Unit (CVGBU)\n    &gt; Cisco Systems, Inc.\n    &gt; 250 Apollo Drive\n    &gt; Chelmsford, MA 01824\n    &gt; \n    &gt; Phone : (800) 572-6771 x 45817  (978) 244-5817 [direct]\n    &gt; Paging: (800) 365-4578 [voice]  pcm@...
