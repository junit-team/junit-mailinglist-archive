I read the paper you<br/>\n&gt; advised & drew some conclusion on my app design.Could you tell me if<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m right or not ? Problem statement :  The Data class allows to<br/>\n&gt; access Data in a formatted file (similar to DBF).  Change request is<br/>\n&gt; to enable multiclient simultaneous access. Solution 1 :  Singelton is<br/>\n&gt; right but throws too much code dependencies in the system which  as a<br/>\n&gt; direct consequence of making unit testing rather painfull when there<br/>\n&gt; is  some (more) change requests.   singelton has something fundamently<br/>\n&gt; wrong :    class do not need to know how they are used.    Access to<br/>\n&gt; single instance should be made via a ToolBox returning    instances of<br/>\n&gt; the class as requested. Solution 2 :    Client code should be told to<br/>\n&gt; access the class via an external Factory.    Problem is not yet<br/>\n&gt; perfectly solved. I cannot formalize yet the next step in the logic,<br/>\n&gt; but I more or less consider it as making a move from a Factory to a<br/>\n&gt; method factory. I probably need a few more days to grasp the internals<br/>\n&gt; of that. I also wonder why the code talks straight to the instance<br/>\n&gt; rather that to interfaces.Though slightly slower, that would be to me<br/>\n&gt; the ultimate abstraction in the system more than the method<br/>\n&gt; factory. Do you agree with that ?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Hi Thomas,<br/>\n<br/>\nSorry, I think I missed the question in all of that.  Did J.B.&#39;s recent<br/>\npost help answer this?
