Yes, I already searched this archive...\n\nUp to my question: What is the best way to test units, that create\nfiles (in my case they are PDF files).\n\nI see two oppinions for that (my case: PDFs) :\n\n1) visual testing (no automation)\n\n2) visual testing + file comparison (create a pdf that fits your needs\nand check created files against that by file comparison; critical with\nPDFs because two different PDF may look the same :-/ )\n\nWhat is your opinion about that? Or am I seeing something wrong? Or is\nit impossible to JUnit-test file creation?\n\n\nThanks,\n\nChristian\n\n\n\n",
