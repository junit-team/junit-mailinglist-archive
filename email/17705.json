There should be some form of return value, error code, or <br/>\n&gt;callback that indicates whether the instrument took the action. That&#39;s <br/>\n&gt;useful for a lot more than just testing.<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>If I remember correctly there were error returns, but error returns <br/>\ndon&#39;t tell you whether the software performed exactly the steps you <br/>\nwanted to have performed.  We didn&#39;t want to run the instrumentation <br/>\nover and over again for testing because it consumed some expensive <br/>\nmaterial.  Mocking would&#39;ve helped.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Perhaps the instrument only had a one-way communication channel? I&#39;ve <br/>\n&gt;seen a few like that. If so, you could add a pass-through device that <br/>\n&gt;logs all the requests, or use some other device to check what the <br/>\n&gt;instrument does. That&#39;s certainly non-trivial, but not impossible <br/>\n&gt;either. Furthermore the test would be of the instrument itself rather <br/>\n&gt;than of what the instrument is supposed to do.<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>What you&#39;re talking about is a choice, and it&#39;s nice to make it freely, <br/>\nnot to have it forced upon you by a framework.  Like I said earlier, I <br/>\ndo like having system tests, but tests that test logic independently <br/>\nhave value and they can be much less expensive on a number of fronts.<br/>\n<br/>\nMichael Feathers<br/>\nwww.objectmentor.com</div>",
