Then I will add proper assertion statement \nto my test code, or even add another testing method so that next time \nthe assertion will occur as early as possible.\n\n-- \nDisclaimer:  I join all the news groups out of my own interest.

Well, after fighting\n&gt;with the IDE for months now, I have come to the conclusion that, for lack of\n&gt;better verbiage, jBuilder&#39;s (4.0) debugger is flaky.  The debugger\n&gt;constantly goes into code that it shouldn&#39;t, and actually forces me to go\n&gt;back to using the old System.out method of debugging, how wasteful!\n&gt;\n&gt;Does anyone know of a decent debugger?  I am currently using the jdk1.3.1.\n&gt;\n&gt;Thanks in advance,\n&gt;\n&gt;Russ Baker\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt;junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; \n&gt;\n&gt;Your use of Yahoo!
