But it has\n&gt; advantages.\n&gt;\n&gt; Consecutive tests which depend on failed tests, are not executed, which\n&gt; speeds up the tests. It also increases the information value. People are not\n&gt; confused with dozens or even hundreds of failed tests when just one or two\n&gt; tests really failed on which most other tests depend. I know of situations\n&gt; where there are dozenzs of failed tests (or more) reported by CruiseControl,\n&gt; and noone looks into them until one week before release date. This happens.\n&gt; It makes developers afraid to look into the apparent mess. If there would be\n&gt; just one or two failed tests, they would look into it more likely, and\n&gt; sooner.\n&gt;\n&gt; The heuristic strategy would not really solve the problem. since it is not\n&gt; equivalent to the dependency specification. It would still run all tests,\n&gt; but the likelyhood that the first run tests are the cause for all the errors\n&gt; would not be very high I think, whereas you could trust the dependencies\n&gt; very much if they are set correctly.\n&gt;\n&gt; Dependencies are a frequent topic. We have it in OSGI, in issue tracking\n&gt; software, in project management software, in requirement specifications and\n&gt; in test specifications. Why not support it in JUnit tests too?\n&gt;\n&gt; Well, this is just some quick thoughts about it. This issue alone will\n&gt; certainly not draw people to other test frameworks, but it would improve\n&gt; JUnit I think. Noone would be forced to use that feature, but I think it\n&gt; would be good, if one could use it with JUnit, even in an coarse way (for\n&gt; example if the dependency &quot;testApplicationServerRuns&quot; passed).\n&gt;\n&gt; Bye,\n&gt;\n&gt; Hans\n&gt;\n&gt; --- On Thu, 7/17/08, Kent Beck &lt;kentb@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; From: Kent Beck &lt;kentb@...&gt;\n&gt; Subject: RE: [junit] Does JUnit 4 now support dependencies?\n&gt; To: junit@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Date: Thursday, July 17, 2008, 9:28 AM\n&gt;\n&gt; Hans,\n&gt;\n&gt; I agree that test dependencies are a good idea. In my experience, though,\n&gt;\n&gt; they aren&#39;t worth the investment to express them explicitly. I would rather\n&gt;\n&gt; put the same time into improving the design of the software so the tests can\n&gt;\n&gt; run fast.\n&gt;\n&gt; I wonder if it would be possible to infer dependencies from historical data,\n&gt;\n&gt; though. That and the &quot;most recently broken first&quot; heuristic might provide\n&gt;\n&gt; nearly optimal &quot;time to first failure&quot;, which I assume is your goal in\n&gt;\n&gt; wishing for dependencies.\n&gt;\n&gt; Regards,\n&gt;\n&gt; Kent Beck\n&gt;\n&gt; Three Rivers Institute\n&gt;\n&gt; _____\n&gt;\n&gt; From: junit@yahoogroups. com [mailto:junit@yahoogroups. com] On Behalf Of\n&gt;\n&gt; hans_schwaebli\n&gt;\n&gt; Sent: Wednesday, July 16, 2008 5:58 AM\n&gt;\n&gt; To: junit@yahoogroups. com\n&gt;\n&gt; Subject: [junit] Does JUnit 4 now support dependencies?\n&gt;\n&gt; I now think that test dependencies are a good idea.\n&gt;\n&gt; Does JUnit 4.x support such dependencies, or if not, is it planned for\n&gt;\n&gt; a certain JUnit release to be added?\n&gt;\n&gt; For example, if the login test did not work, than all other tests\n&gt;\n&gt; cannot work. They depend on the login test.
