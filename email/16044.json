However, for commercial software development, is this<br/>\n&gt; still possible ?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Definitely - my team has been doing it for 5+ years, over several projects<br/>\nspanning several languages. Our products while not bug free have fewer than<br/>\nmany I&#39;ve known along the way. As developers of desktop GUI applications<br/>\n(Swing/Eclipse SWT/WinForms .NET) - its a bit more difficult to test some of<br/>\nour code - but none the less our overall test coverage has been around 65%.<br/>\nIn the end I think it takes us less time not more to develop our products<br/>\nwriting tests. That said a few members of the team still need proding to<br/>\nwrite their test cases.<br/>\n<br/>\n* One intersting point I found is that after Junit-based testing is<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; introduced, programmers tend to use IDE debugger much less than<br/>\n&gt; before.  This would save lots of time. Is that true ?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yes very true - in fact when bugs show up in our GUI code I usually try to<br/>\nwrite a test case to replicate them. When I have to debug its much faster to<br/>\ndebug from a test case than clicking around in the GUI.<br/>\n<br/>\n* Some guys say JUnit is good for biz / util code testing. But for web<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; application development, where HTML/javascript would be root cause of<br/>\n&gt; lots of bugs, Junit is not so powerful. Any comments ?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Lots of people do this sort of testing FIT (<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://fit.c2.com/)\">http://fit.c2.com/)</a> or similiar<br/>\nframeworks. I don&#39;t know much about it since I&#39;ve never done javascript.<br/>\n<br/>\n* How can I convince managers and programmers that JUnit-based is<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; really possible for commercial software development ? Any differnece<br/>\n&gt; from open-source projects ?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Show them the number of replies on this list? Also start writing tests in<br/>\nyou&#39;re own corner of the world. Integrate them into your build. Give a short<br/>\nlive demo at lunch. Bring you&#39;re co-workers in for some pair programming,<br/>\n.....<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers<br/>\nMark Levison<br/>\n----------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nBlog: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://dotnetjunkies.com/WebLog/mlevison/\">http://dotnetjunkies.com/WebLog/mlevison/</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",
