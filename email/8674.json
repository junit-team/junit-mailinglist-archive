I understand that the framework offers us <br/>\na lot of possibilities, and it&#39;s up to us to choose what&#39;s the best <br/>\nway to use it, according to our needs and purposes. I think all <br/>\napproaches have its pros and cons; for example, the approach he&#39;s <br/>\nusing, of running batch tests starting with &quot;Test&quot;, has the problem <br/>\nof not selecting a particular set of tests to run each time, but he <br/>\nhas the benefit of not worrying about anything except his unit tests. <br/>\nThe suite approach, as you suggests, has a pro of grouping tests, but <br/>\nhas also a con of hard-coding in a class which tests should be run. <br/>\nThis is related to the problem I have, of running a piece of code <br/>\nsomewhere before all tests.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I&#39;ve said something wrong, feel free to correct me, I&#39;m always <br/>\nready to learn.<br/>\n<br/>\nLeonardo Barros<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;J.
