I have put an example below.  Why is the\nconstructor, and not just setup(), called many times?  Shouldn&#39;t it be that\nonly setup is called once for each test?  I&#39;ve used both ant and eclipse to\nrun the test case.  I&#39;m a little fuzzy on how this is even possible.\n\n\n\npublic class DSLClientTest extends TestCase\n{\n    public DSLClientTest()\n    {\n        // This is printed three times\n        System.out.println(&quot;Constructor called&quot;);\n    }\n\n    protected void setUp() throws Exception\n    {\n        // This is printed three times\n        System.out.println(&quot;setup called&quot;);\n    }\n\n    public void testTest1()\n    {\n        assertTrue(&quot;&quot;, true);\n    }\n\n    public void testTest2()\n    {\n        assertTrue(&quot;&quot;, true);\n    }\n\n    public void testTest3()\n    {\n        assertTrue(&quot;&quot;, true);\n    }\n}\n\n\nAdrian\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n",
