We are in the business \nof making loans and have a non-trivial number of rules and mitigants \nfor credit checking. If we had an extensive series of unit tests to \ncheck that we applied our current rules correctly (which we don&#39;t) \nand we stuck a rules engine in the mix - is there a way I could \nleverage those mythical unit tests to compare the results of my \ncurrent code against the rules-based results ? Is there a way I could \nmeasure the impact of a rules change by comparing the unit tests \nresults of the before and after versions of the rules ?\n\nThanks,\n\nRob Rambusch\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
