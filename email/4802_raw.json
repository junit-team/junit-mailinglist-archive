Olivier&quot; wrote:\n\n&gt; The rule of thumb is that unit tests should be as standalone as possible,\n&gt; and dependencies on external resources such as databases or files should be\n&gt; minimized or eliminated.  This makes perfect sense.  Tests which rely on\n&gt; external resources are  not self-contained, are harder to read, and can be\n&gt; broken even if the code is functioning correctly.  However, code does touch\n&gt; external resources at some point.  Shouldn&#39;t this be tested, and how?\n&gt;\n&gt; Specifically, I have code that parses a xml catalog file and builds a\n&gt; catalog object structure.  I want to verify that the parsing works\n&gt; correctly.  In particular, I want to make sure that it robustly handles\n&gt; unusual conditions such as catalogs with certain branches missing.  It\n&gt; seems to me that the simplest way to do this is to have a test which uses\n&gt; the parsing code to parse a very simple catalog and verifies that it builds\n&gt; what I expect it to.\n&gt;\n&gt; But to do this test I do need some external resource, a simple catalog\n&gt; file.  Ok.  Now I can&#39;t simply look at the test to see what it does.  I\n&gt; also have to look at the file.  Are there cleaner alternatives?  Must I\n&gt; simply accept that there will occasionally be external resources required\n&gt; to test functionality at the boundaries of the system?  If so, are there\n&gt; best practices for this scenario?  Am I missing something?  I&#39;d love to\n&gt; hear peoples thoughts.\n&gt;\n\nI&#39;ll first try to embed the XML text in the test and use a Writer to test the\nparsing.  This usually works for most cases.\n\nWhen I must use external resources, I&#39;ll use a JVM parameter to keep the tests\nlocation independent:\n\n    java -Ddata.dir=/home/mike/tests/data MyTest\n\nThen a base test class knows how to query for the property and apply a relative\npath to all other tests requiring external resources.\n\nMike\n\n--\nMike Clark\nClarkware Consulting, Inc.\nhttp://www.clarkware.com\n720.851.2014\n\n\n\n",
