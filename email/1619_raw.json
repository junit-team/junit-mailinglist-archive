And if it is then, has anybody got any tips to\n&gt; implement the test.\n\n &gt;\n\nIdeally, software under load should exhibit constant latency (response \ntime) and linear throughput regardless of the load level. \nRealistically, software under various degrees of load should scale to \nexhibit low latency and high throughput as necessary for the application.\n\nWith JUnitPerf, you can generate a simulated load by decorating an \nexisting test as a LoadTest.  The LoadTest is useful to help verify that \nthe decorated test produces the expected results under various load \nlevels.  A LoadTest can then be decorated with a TimedTest to \nautomatically check that the load test meets an expected latency.\n\nThere are a number of good load testing tools on the market, and \nJUnitPerf doesn&#39;t attempt to match their features.  Rather, JUnitPerf is \nintended to be used to keep an automatic check on expected results \nresponse times in the spirit of relentless refactoring and testing.\n\nMike\n\n-- \nMike Clark\nClarkware Consulting, Inc.\nCustom Software Architecture, Design,\nDevelopment, and Performance Consulting\nhttp://www.clarkware.com\n\n\n",
