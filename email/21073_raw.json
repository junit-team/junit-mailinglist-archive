Now, \nthese run against a single backend and now several developers in my \ngroup would like to use these tests against other backends to test them. \nThe most natural way to do this is with the test suite mechanism in \njUnit. That is to say, make up a suite that requires merely that the \nbackend be set and test away. Or so I thought.\n\nThe different backends are different projects in our group and live in \ndifferent Maven modules.\n\nThe problem is that making a suite using annotations does not really \nwork so well. The annotations are not inherited. The other solution \nwhich is to have the developers make their own suites by annotations is \nalso very clunky and will probably break at some point.\n\nSo here is my question: Is there any way to make a test suite that is a \nharness and can be reused? \n\nI assume that jUnit 3.8&#39;s method of explicitly creating a suite is going \nto get deprecated soon, right? So that would be a deadend. Also, are \ntheir plans to make annotations inheritable at some point in jUnit? We \ncould maybe live with cutting and pasting for the short term if we knew \nthat this issue would get resolved at some point.\n\nThanks!\n\nJeff\n\n",
