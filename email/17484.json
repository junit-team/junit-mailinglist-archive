I have a test case of 6 test methods. As I<br/>\nfigured so far, each test method invokes setUp and tearDown methods<br/>\nonce. In setUp method I defined some user parameters (USER_ID, and<br/>\nsuch...) which are then passed to the test methods. I get these<br/>\nparameters from file and then put them into an arraylist (which is not<br/>\nentirely necessary, but hey...). What I need to know if there is a<br/>\nsimple way of passing the same USER_ID to all the test methods, and -<br/>\nafter all the methods have been executed - to pass the next USER_ID,<br/>\nand so forth... Basically, one USER_ID per test case execution/iteration.<br/>\n<br/>\nIterating through an arraylist in setUp method, since the testcase is<br/>\ninstantiated as many times as there are methods in that case, will<br/>\nmake it iterate through every n-th record in file, n being the number<br/>\nof methods. That&#39;s pretty much silly and useless.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnnotations (@BeforeClass and such) are a no-no.<br/>\n<br/>\nAny help is welcome, thanks.<br/>\nTomislav</div>",
