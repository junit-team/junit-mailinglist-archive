But if you want to, go ahead.\n\nI think that a testing tool can suggest you to change your code but \nshouldn&#39;t force you to do it.  You - and not the testing tool - are the \none knowing what the code should do.  You shouldn&#39;t for example be \nforced to change the access specifiers of a class to please the testing \ntool.\n\n&gt; Testability is a good quality to have -- and many times\n&gt; it accidently improves the design.\n\nIt&#39;s hopefully not &quot;accidental&quot; :-)  If your tests are easy to write, \nit&#39;s the sign that your classes have a loose coupling and high cohesion, \nwhich is the sign of a good design.\n\n-Vladimir\n\n-- \nVladimir Bossicard\nwww.bossicard.com\n\n\n",
