I\ndon&#39;t have experience with JNLP, but Eclipse plug-ins have many of the\nsame restrictions (it&#39;s impossible to get most services without a\nsignficant container start-up overhead), and mocks really help me\nthere.\n\nGood luck,\n\n   David Saff\n\nOn 3/23/07, Luigi Lauro &lt;luigi.lauro@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; I&#39;ve found out on my own skin that it&#39;s very hard to test JNLP-enabled applications (Java\n&gt; Web Start).\n&gt;\n&gt; This is because the jnlp service implementations such  as PersistenceServiceImpl and\n&gt; BasicServiceImpl get only loaded at JVM  startup time when java is launched from the\n&gt; javaws executable, which needs a full fledged jnlp package (.jnlp file, jar archives, etc...).\n&gt;\n&gt; This makes testing jnlp-based classes very hard,  since automated testing with JUnit or\n&gt; debugging with an IDE is out of discussion AFAIK.\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;ve tried manually including my Mac OS X Java6 javaws.jar (which  contains the system-\n&gt; dependent implementation classes for the JNLP  interfaces) and manually initializing and\n&gt; loading the services, but it all fails horribly because of several missing things (mostly\n&gt; missing system properties, which impl classes expect, and are  probably set up by javaws\n&gt; or some other yet-to-be-found class).\n&gt;\n&gt; It can _PROBABLY_ be done by tinkering with it and slowly adding everything needed by\n&gt; going exception and after exception manually  putting in the tidbits impl classes expect,\n&gt; but it&#39;s for sure a long  and tedious work, and I guess it would be strongly platform-\n&gt; dependent (for example, I&#39;ve noticed the impl classes in javaws varies consistently  on the\n&gt; various platforms, and so do JNLP expected system properties).\n&gt;\n&gt; Or, maybe, if I am REALLY lucky, I can find a JNLPInitializerWhatever class, with a\n&gt; &#39;startmeup&#39; method for setting  everything. Dreaming is not a crime you know? :P\n&gt;\n&gt; Any help here is SERIOUSLY appreciated, I&#39;m currently losing hours and hours each day\n&gt; because I have to deploy a full JNLP java package in order to test jnlp-enabled application,\n&gt; and I can&#39;t debug them at all.\n&gt;\n&gt; Also, automated JUnit testing can&#39;t presently be done AFAIK.\n&gt;\n&gt; Anyone knows a solution, or can give me some hints about this problem?\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks in advance for any answer\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
