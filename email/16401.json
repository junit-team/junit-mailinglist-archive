I liked it <br/>\nbecause it was simple for the simplest case of setting expectations.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I started using jMock, I much preferred it, because:<br/>\n<br/>\n1. It has direct support for fakes/stubs.<br/>\n2. It makes ignoring method parameters easy.<br/>\n3. Its support for complex parameter, method or invocation matching is <br/>\ngreat.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf there is ever a 2nd edition of _JUnit Recipes_, I will replace all <br/>\nthe EasyMock example code with jMock.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe people who don&#39;t like jMock often say it&#39;s because declaring the <br/>\nmethod names as strings makes refactoring more error-prone. That might <br/>\nbe the case, but I have never felt pain as a result of it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope that helps.<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJ. B.
