I know ya&#39;ll are really sharp, so\nlet me start with a little higher up, and then dig a\nlittle, which will serve as more of a starting point\nfor the material in the earlier posts.\n\n\nHere&#39;s a more general scenario.\n\nThere&#39;s a developer.  She fires up eclipse,\ncreates a new class, and codes a method.\n\nJust 1.\n\nThen she selects the Eclipse menu (Hypothetical)\n\nTest &gt; test\n\nand \n\na src/main/test\n\ndirectory within her project is automatically created\nwith tests that cover her method exhaustively (100%).\n\nSo when I say 0 time for the developer, I mean 0 time\ncoding the tests.\n\nNow she reviews the tests.  Could be that she finds\nthat her method needs some tweaking, to further\ncontrain it&#39;s behaviour.  Then she regenerates the\ntests.\n\nEtc.\n\nNow I think the question becomes:\n\n&quot;Well, how do we know the test is tested\n100%/Exhaustively?&quot;\n\nThis is where the part about reading some of the other\nstuff I wrote earlier in previous posts comes in. \nI&#39;ll be glad to elaborate on those :-)\n\nCheers,\n- Ole\n\n\n\n\n\n\n--- &quot;J.

What am I missing?\n&gt; -----\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m sorry, Ole; I don&#39;t know how to ask that\n&gt; question more directly, \n&gt; simply nor specifically. Further, I don&#39;t understand\n&gt; why you just can&#39;t \n&gt; answer it directly and simply.\n&gt; \n&gt; Take care.\n&gt; -- \n&gt; J. B.
