How do I code this in Junit? It seems the with the \n&gt; TestSuite multiple tests could run concurrently-- is there some way \nto \n&gt; start up the server maybe sleep for a couple seconds and then run \nthe \n&gt; client test and shutdown the server?\n\nJUnit is designed to be used as a unit testing framework.  In this \ncase, for example, it would be easier for you to use one of the \npatterns below to test your client/server program, than to try to do \nintegration/acceptance/user testing.\n\nPatterns you can use to test your application:\nSELF SHUNT TEST: http://www.c2.com/cgi/wiki?SelfShuntPattern\nMOCK-OBJECT: http://www.c2.com/cgi/wiki?MockObject\n\n(Also: search the archives for previous posts on the topic.)\n\nThe basic premise is:  you want to test components one at a time.  If \nyou try to test both the client *AND* the server at the same time, it \nwould make it harder for you to find where the actual problem lies.  \nSo:  test the components (units) one at a time.  If the component \ninteracts with other components, fake them out.  This way, you have a \nmuch higher guarantee that the problem will be in the component under \ntest.\n\nHTH,\n\nManuel Amago.\nmailto:mamago@...\n\n\n\n",
