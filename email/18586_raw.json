Remember that TDD is a\n&gt; /design/ activity, not a testing activity.  I am afraid that generated\n&gt; assertions would break the basic cycle feedback of TDD.\n&gt;\n&gt; I am not going to tell you not to do this project, but calling it TDD\n&gt; would cause me to call into question your understanding of TDD.\n&gt;\n&gt; chet\n\nAgreed, essentially Jim, what you are describing (to me at least) is\nautomating the unit testing of code.  It does not sound like TDD.\n\nAnd there&#39;s nothing wrong with that - JUnit is a tool that makes no\nassumptions on what design process we use.\n\nIndeed, there are already several tools out there that can\nautogenerate JUnit tests for code, and still others that &#39;play&#39; with\nthe byte code to see if your unit tests are actually any good at\ntesting.  However, none of these tools are aimed at TDD, they are\naimed at Unit Testing.\n\nhth\n\nGood luck with the course\n\nAndrew\n\n",
