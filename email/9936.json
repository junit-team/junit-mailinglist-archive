Lately, I have started introducing JUnit, on the grounds that the sooner I teach them good habits, the more likely they are to stick with them. I&#39;m using the java.lang.String class as the object being tested, so that we only have to worry about writing one class instead of two.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy question is: When testing overloaded methods (String.indexOf() in this specific case), is it better for each overloaded method get it&#39;s own testXXX() method or is it ok to lump them all in the one test? I have them all in one test right now, on the grounds that the test is against the index feature, rather than the individual methods.<br/>\n<br/>\nThoughts please.<br/>\n<br/>\nSimon<br/>\n<br/>\n-----------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nSimon P.
