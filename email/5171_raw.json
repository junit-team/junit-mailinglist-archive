I&#39;ve been developing GUIs on a number of platforms for years,\n&gt; and I th=\r\nought I was only doing very basic tool-oriented tasks, but I&#39;ve\n&gt; never don=\r\ne a gui that reduces to a single component with a single\n&gt; message.  Maybe =\r\nI just don&#39;t establish the proper concepts in the gui,\n&gt; but I invariably h=\r\nave several things interacting.\n\nWe may be talking at cross purposes and no=\r\nt understanding each other. Let&#39;s\nget specific. Imagine a Dialog with sever=\r\nal test fields, labels, and buttons\n- just to be specific. There are severa=\r\nl components that can generate events\nto the Mediator/Presenter/Fa=E7ade or=\r\n whatever we want to call it. The\nPresenter sends several messages to the D=\r\nialog through an interface.\n\n\n&gt; \n&gt; Yes, the right message gets sent to the =\r\nDialog, but the Dialog still\n&gt; doesn&#39;t show up.  Now what?\n\nThere&#39;s an API =\r\ncall to make it appear - I&#39;ve been in C++/MFC land the last\nfew weeks so I =\r\nforget what it is - setVisible(true)??? or something like\nthat.\n\nSo if the =\r\nPresenter sends a show() message to the Dialog, and show() is\nimplemented w=\r\nith a setVisible(true), and you say it doesn&#39;t appear, what are\nyou going t=\r\no do about it? I maintain that a unit test of the Dialog doesn&#39;t\ngive any b=\r\netter feedback than just looking at the thing - or in this case,\nlooking fo=\r\nr the thing ;-)\n\n\n&gt; In my experience, the design space between\n&gt; two compon=\r\nents is where I find the most bugs; it&#39;s rarely either one or\n&gt; the other b=\r\nut usually the interaction of the two that causes the problem\n&gt; or unexpect=\r\ned behavior.\n\n\nSure - which is why I want to move the complexity to just on=\r\ne place where I\ncan test it.\n\n-- \nRobert Koss, Ph.D.     | Training, Mentor=\r\ning, Contract Development\nSenior Consultant      | Object Oriented Design, =\r\nC++, Java\nwww.objectmentor.com   | Extreme Programming\n\n\n\n",
