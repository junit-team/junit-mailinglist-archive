I *think*=\r\n\ncategories would really help here, although I&#39;m more than willing to be\nto=\r\nld why there are better alternatives. They would allow tests to be\ngrouped =\r\nin code according to what was being tested, but also allow for\ncertain test=\r\ns to be marked as &quot;very long running&quot; (the kind of test\nwhich might be done=\r\n on a weekly basis rather than nightly) or\n&quot;performance&quot; (functionality whi=\r\nch is tested for correctness elsewhere,\nbut set up in this test to get perf=\r\normance measurements) etc.\n\nI&#39;ve seen a feature request for this on the SF =\r\nsite, but it talks of the\ntest runner doing the work - which would certainl=\r\ny allow whole classes\nto be classified accordingly (although each runner wo=\r\nuld probably need\nto implement the functionality), but the individual tests=\r\n might be\nsomewhat harder to include/exclude, if the normal introspector is=\r\n being\nused.\n\nPersonally, I think this would be great functionality to have=\r\n in the\ncore of JUnit4.\n\nSo, why am I wrong? :)\n \nJon Skeet\nSenior Software=\r\n Engineer\nCLEARSWIFT\nThe MIMEsweeper Company\n\nDDI:               +44 (0) 11=\r\n89  038  109\nMobile:           +44 (0) 7970 158 865\nSwitchboard:   +44 (0) =\r\n1189  038  903 \nFax:               +44 (0) 1189  039  000      \nWeb: www.cl=\r\nearswift.com \n\n\nClearswift monitors, controls and protects all its messagin=\r\ng traffic in compliance with its corporate email policy using Clearswift pr=\r\noducts.\nFind out more about Clearswift, its solutions and services at http:=\r\n//www.clearswift.com\n\nThis communication is confidential and may contain pr=\r\nivileged information intended solely for the named addressee(s).
