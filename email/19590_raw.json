This release\nis the biggest since JUnit 4.0.  More information below (taken from\nthe release notes).  To download, please go to\n\nhttp://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=15278&package_id=12472&release_id=524119\n\nThanks to all of the bug reports, feature requests, and good\nconversation so far.  We hope this release will provoke more of the\nsame.\n\n   David Saff and Kent Beck\n\n## Summary of Changes in version 4.4 ##\n\nJUnit is designed to efficiently capture developers&#39; intentions about\ntheir code, and quickly check their code matches those intentions.\nOver the last year, we&#39;ve been talking about what things developers\nwould like to say about their code that have been difficult in the\npast, and how we can make them easier.\n\n### assertThat ###\n\nTwo years ago, Joe Walnes built a [new assertion mechanism][walnes] on\ntop of what was\nthen [JMock 1][].  The method name was `assertThat`, and the syntax\nlooked like this:\n\n[walnes]: http://joe.truemesh.com/blog/000511.html\n[JMock 1]: http://www.jmock.org/download.html\n\n    assertThat(x, is(3));\n    assertThat(x, is(not(4)));\n    assertThat(responseString,\neither(containsString(&quot;color&quot;)).or(containsString(&quot;colour&quot;)));\n    assertThat(myList, hasItem(&quot;3&quot;));\n\nMore generally:\n\n    assertThat([value], [matcher statement]);\n\nAdvantages of this assertion syntax include:\n\n- More readable and typeable: this syntax allows you to think in terms\nof subject, verb, object\n  (assert &quot;x is 3&quot;) rather than `assertEquals`, which uses verb,\nobject, subject (assert &quot;equals 3 x&quot;)\n\n- Combinations: any matcher statement `s` can be negated (`not(s)`),\ncombined (`either(s).or(t)`),\n  mapped to a collection (`each(s)`), or used in custom combinations\n(`afterFiveSeconds(s)`)\n\n- Readable failure messages.  Compare\n\n        assertTrue(responseString.contains(&quot;color&quot;) ||\nresponseString.contains(&quot;colour&quot;));\n        // ==&gt; failure message:\n        // java.lang.AssertionError:\n\n        assertThat(responseString, anyOf(containsString(&quot;color&quot;),\ncontainsString(&quot;colour&quot;)));\n        // ==&gt; failure message:\n        // java.lang.AssertionError:\n        // Expected: (a string containing &quot;color&quot; or a string\ncontaining &quot;colour&quot;)\n        //      got: &quot;Please choose a font&quot;\n\n- Custom Matchers.  By implementing the `Matcher` interface yourself,\nyou can get all of the\n  above benefits for your own custom assertions.\n\n- For a more thorough description of these points, see [Joe Walnes&#39;s\n  original post][walnes].\n\nWe have decided to include this API directly in JUnit.\nIt&#39;s an extensible and readable syntax, and it enables\nnew features, like [assumptions][] and [theories][].\n\n[assumptions]: #assumptions\n[theories]: #theories\n\nSome notes:\n\n- The old assert methods are never, ever, going away.  Developers may\n  continue using the old `assertEquals`, `assertTrue`, and so on.\n- The second parameter of an `assertThat` statement is a `Matcher`.\n  We include the Matchers we want as static imports, like this:\n\n        import static org.hamcrest.CoreMatchers.is;\n\n  or:\n\n        import static org.hamcrest.CoreMatchers.*;\n\n- Manually importing `Matcher` methods can be frustrating.  [Eclipse\n3.3][] includes the ability to\n  define\n  &quot;Favorite&quot; classes to import static methods from, which makes it easier\n  (Search for &quot;Favorites&quot; in the Preferences dialog).\n  We expect that support for static imports will improve in all Java\nIDEs in the future.\n\n[Eclipse 3.3]: http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/\n\n- To allow compatibility with a wide variety of possible matchers,\n  we have decided to include the classes from hamcrest-core,\n  from the [Hamcrest][] project.  This is the first time that\n  third-party classes have been included in JUnit.\n\n[Hamcrest]: http://code.google.com/p/hamcrest/\n\n- JUnit currently ships with a few matchers, defined in\n  `org.hamcrest.CoreMatchers` and `org.junit.matchers.JUnitMatchers`.\n  To use many, many more, consider downloading the [full hamcrest package][].\n\n[full hamcrest package]:\nhttp://hamcrest.googlecode.com/files/hamcrest-all-1.1.jar\n\n- JUnit contains special support for comparing string and array\n  values, giving specific information on how they differ.  This is not\n  yet available using the `assertThat` syntax, but we hope to bring\n  the two assert methods into closer alignment in future releases.\n\n&lt;a name=&quot;assumptions&quot; /&gt;\n### Assumptions ###\n\nIdeally, the developer writing a test has control of all of the forces\nthat might cause a test to fail.\nIf this isn&#39;t immediately possible, making dependencies explicit can\noften improve a design.\nFor example, if a test fails when run in a different locale than the\ndeveloper intended,\nit can be fixed by explicitly passing a locale to the domain code.\n\nHowever, sometimes this is not desirable or possible.\nIt&#39;s good to be able to run a test against the code as it is currently written,\nimplicit assumptions and all, or to write a test that exposes a known bug.\nFor these situations, JUnit now includes the ability to express &quot;assumptions&quot;:\n\n    import static org.junit.Assume.*\n\n    @Test public void filenameIncludesUsername() {\n       assumeThat(File.separatorChar, is(&#39;/&#39;));\n       assertThat(new User(&quot;optimus&quot;).configFileName(),\nis(&quot;configfiles/optimus.cfg&quot;));\n    }\n\n    @Test public void correctBehaviorWhenFilenameIsNull() {\n       assumeTrue(bugFixed(&quot;13356&quot;));  // bugFixed is not included in JUnit\n       assertThat(parse(null), is(new NullDocument()));\n    }\n\nWith this release, a failed assumption will lead to the test being\nmarked as passing,\nregardless of what the code below the assumption may assert.\nIn the future, this may change, and a failed assumption may lead to\nthe test being ignored:\nhowever, third-party runners do not currently allow this option.\n\nWe have included `assumeTrue` for convenience, but thanks to the\ninclusion of Hamcrest, we do not need to create `assumeEquals`,\n`assumeSame`, and other analogues to the `assert*` methods.  All of\nthose functionalities are subsumed in `assumeThat`, with the appropriate\nmatcher.\n\n&lt;a name=&quot;theories&quot; /&gt;\n### Theories ###\n\nMore flexible and expressive assertions, combined with the ability to\nstate assumptions clearly, lead to a new kind of statement of intent,\nwhich we call a &quot;Theory&quot;.  A test captures the intended behavior in\none particular scenario.  A theory captures some aspect of the\nintended behavior in possibly\ninfinite numbers of potential scenarios.  For example:\n\n    @RunWith(Theories.class)\n    public class UserTest {\n      @DataPoint public static String GOOD_USERNAME = &quot;optimus&quot;;\n      @DataPoint public static String USERNAME_WITH_SLASH = &quot;optimus/prime&quot;;\n\n      @Theory public void filenameIncludesUsername(String username) {\n        assumeThat(username, not(containsString(&quot;/&quot;)));\n        assertThat(new User(username).configFileName(),\ncontainsString(username));\n      }\n    }\n\nThis makes it clear that the user&#39;s filename should be included in the\nconfig file name, only if it doesn&#39;t contain a slash.  Another test\nor theory might define what happens when a username does contain a slash.\n\n`UserTest` will attempt to run `filenameIncludesUsername` on\nevery compatible `DataPoint` defined in the class.  If any of the\nassumptions fail, the data point is silently ignored.  If all of the\nassumptions pass, but an assertion fails, the test fails.\n\nThe support for Theories has been absorbed from the [Popper][]\nproject, and [more complete documentation][popper-docs] can be found\nthere.\n\n[Popper]: http://popper.tigris.org\n[popper-docs]: http://popper.tigris.org/tutorial.html\n\nDefining general statements in this way can jog the developer&#39;s memory\nabout other potential data points and tests, also allows [automated\ntools][junit-factory] to [search][my-blog] for new, unexpected data\npoints that expose bugs.\n\n[junit-factory]: http://www.junitfactory.org\n[my-blog]: http://shareandenjoy.saff.net/2007/04/popper-and-junitfactory.html\n\n### Other changes ###\n\nThis release contains other bug fixes and new features.  Among them:\n\n- Annotated descriptions\n\n  Runner UIs, Filters, and Sorters operate on Descriptions of test\n  methods and test classes.  These Descriptions now include the\n  annotations on the original Java source element, allowing for richer\n  display of test results, and easier development of annotation-based\n  filters.\n\n- Bug fix (1715326): assertEquals now compares all Numbers using their\n  native implementation of `equals`.  This assertion, which passed in\n  4.3, will now fail:\n\n        assertEquals(new Integer(1), new Long(1));\n\n  Non-integer Numbers (Floats, Doubles, BigDecimals, etc),\n  which were compared incorrectly in 4.3, are now fixed.\n\n- `assertEquals(long, long)` and `assertEquals(double, double)` have\n  been re-introduced to the `Assert` class, to take advantage of\n  Java&#39;s native widening conversions.  Therefore, this still passes:\n\n        assertEquals(1, 1L);\n\n- The default runner for JUnit 4 test classes has been refactored.\n  The old version was named `TestClassRunner`, and the new is named\n  `JUnit4ClassRunner`.  Likewise, `OldTestClassRunner` is now\n  `JUnit3ClassRunner`.  The new design allows variations in running\n  individual test classes to be expressed with fewer custom classes.\n  For a good example, see the source to\n  `org.junit.experimental.theories.runner.api.Theories`.\n\n- The rules for determining which runner is applied by default to a\n  test class have been simplified:\n\n  1. If the class has a `@RunWith` annotation, the annotated runner\n     class is used.\n\n  2. If the class can be run with the JUnit 3 test runner (it\n     subclasses `TestCase`, or contains a `public static Test suite()`\n     method), JUnit38ClassRunner is used.\n\n  3. Otherwise, JUnit4ClassRunner is used.\n\n  This default guess can always be overridden by an explicit\n  `@RunWith(JUnit4ClassRunner.class)` or\n  `@RunWith(JUnit38ClassRunner.class)` annotation.\n\n  The old class names `TestClassRunner` and `OldTestClassRunner`\n  remain as deprecated.\n\n- Bug fix (1739095): Filters and Sorters work correctly on test\n  classes that contain a `suite` method like:\n\n        public static junit.framework.Test suite() {\n          return new JUnit4TestAdapter(MyTest.class);\n        }\n\n- Bug fix (1745048): @After methods are now correctly called\n  after a test method times out.\n\n",
