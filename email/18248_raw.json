I had attended a\n&gt; presentation=\r\n by Robert &quot;Uncle Bob&quot; Martin on Test Driven\n&gt; development. I think the exa=\r\nct example was a program to keep track\n&gt; of a bowling game score. Presentin=\r\ng the Big view object model and\n&gt; one done through incremental, test driven=\r\n development, the later was\n&gt; much simpler. It only required the creation o=\r\nf objects needed to\n&gt; solve the problem rather then the apparent objects an=\r\nd their\n&gt; behaviour.\n\n\nI have no doubt that TDD works great on such simple =\r\nproblems and that it can\neven lead to a reasonable design.  Then again, the=\r\n problem space is so small\nthat you can argue that no design will really be=\r\n wrong anyway...\n\nNow consider a more realistic example, such as an applica=\r\ntion that is\ndealing with five database tables, each with four to ten colum=\r\nns, each of\nwhich needs to be mapped to Java objects in a sensible way (i.e=\r\n. not\nnecessarily mapping the tables and the objects one-to-one) and should=\r\n also\ninclude business methods and objects to make it easier to perform\ndom=\r\nain-specific operations.\n\nUsing TDD to drive such a design is guaranteed to=\r\n lead to an architecture\nthat will be focused on solving micro-problems and=\r\n that will totally miss\nthe big picture.  You are much better off spending =\r\na few minutes with a\npiece of paper or a white board to design your classes=\r\n and your object\ndiagram.\n\nIf you want to use TDD to implement this model a=\r\nfter that, fine, but I\nreally dispute the idea that TDD should drive the de=\r\nsign in the general\ncase, because TDD simply never gives you the big pictur=\r\ne.\n\nMakes sense?\n\n-- \nC=E9dric\nhttp://testng.org\n\n\n[Non-text portions of th=\r\nis message have been removed]\n\n\n",
