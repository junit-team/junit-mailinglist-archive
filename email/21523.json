They<br/>\nall assume that you are testing a class that already exists, and if it<br/>\ndoes, they generate one test per method of that class, which produces<br/>\nunhelpful test classes with unhelpfully named tests.<br/>\n<br/>\n--Nat<br/>\n<br/>\n2009/4/19 Karl Krasnowsky &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:karlkras@...\">karlkras@...</a>&gt;:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; This question is really targeted to those who have used Kent Beck&#39;s book,<br/>\n&gt; Test-Driven Development within the context of the NetBeans IDE, otherwise<br/>\n&gt; please disregard.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Maybe someone here can provide a pointer to already available information on<br/>\n&gt; this.<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m using Kent Beck&#39;s book, Test-Driven Development as a tutorial and was<br/>\n&gt; looking at how i might use NetBeans with its JUnit plugin to mimic his<br/>\n&gt; recommended processes, but right out of the gate I&#39;m having a fundamental<br/>\n&gt; issue.<br/>\n&gt; A standard practice of KB&#39;s method is to code the test before any code is<br/>\n&gt; written, and then backfill the empty bits (class, methods, variables, etc.)<br/>\n&gt; to make the test work.<br/>\n&gt; for example, here&#39;s the first JUnit test he shows in chapter 1 to begin<br/>\n&gt; building from:<br/>\n&gt; Code:<br/>\n&gt; public void testMultiplication() {<br/>\n&gt; Dollar five = new Dollar(5);<br/>\n&gt; five.times(2);<br/>\n&gt; assertEquals(10, five.amount);<br/>\n&gt; }<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Problem I&#39;m having is, if I&#39;m creating tests out of the context of the Java<br/>\n&gt; project, tests in NB aren&#39;t created until you have a class with runtime<br/>\n&gt; methods to create tests from. So I have a chicken egg sort of situation. NB<br/>\n&gt; would do the obvious thing, i.e., have tests generated from code, so the<br/>\n&gt; above doesn&#39;t make any sense as it implies that the code is generated from<br/>\n&gt; the test, which is a cool idea of the IDE could support it.<br/>\n&gt; I have experience using JUnit, so the framework itself isn&#39;t in question,<br/>\n&gt; but how to apply this methodology within the IDE format is.<br/>\n&gt; Do I have to simply short-circuit the default process that NB and the JUnit<br/>\n&gt; plugin manufacture?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; thanks in advance for any help on this,<br/>\n&gt; Karl<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>-- <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.natpryce.com\">http://www.natpryce.com</a></div>",
