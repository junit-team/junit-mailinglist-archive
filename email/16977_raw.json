It goes\n&gt;&gt; counter to AUTOMATION and moves towards more human interv=\r\nention.\n\n&gt;I&#39;m not sure why wanting multiple results leads to needing human\n=\r\n&gt;intervention. .. Can you expand on that?\n\nNot really. My thinking was some=\r\nthing like this... If you write multiple asserts, some of which you expect =\r\nto fail (as in the original example), I was thinking that you were expectin=\r\ng failures and wanted to know each of them ... thus human intervention. How=\r\never, if you write the tests and expect them to pass, then having multiple =\r\nassertions failing only requires human intervention for evaluation of failu=\r\nres, which is no different. So I was on crack.\n \n&gt; The problem with this ap=\r\nproach is not just that it leads to an explosion of\n&gt; test methods, it&#39;s th=\r\nat it decouples code that you obviously want to keep\n&gt; ..\n&gt; other methods t=\r\no modify them too.\n \nI suppose. Though running the tests will find them, so=\r\n they will eventually get fixed.\n \nBy the way, I think it is normal to have=\r\n multiple asserts in a test method. I understand some people would disagree=\r\n, but often I want to test something bigger than a unit. Here&#39;s an actual e=\r\nxample: I want to perform data validation on a composite object. I set up o=\r\nne test for each individual field. There will be some dependent validations=\r\n. I need to set up tests for those. It is likely that when I have dependent=\r\n validations I might have multiple things I need to verify were shown to be=\r\n in error, thus multiple asserts.\n \nIf I use an external resource (e.g. a D=\r\nAO, even a mocked one), if I expect a non-null result but get a null result=\r\n, I&#39;ll have a failure with a null pointer exception. I&#39;d rather put an asse=\r\nrt with a message so I know right away what&#39;s going on.\n \nSo having multipl=\r\ne asserts in a test method, at least for me, is par for the course.\n \n&gt;Sure=\r\n, but you can get the same result with strings, which are even more\n&gt; reada=\r\nble:\n \nFor this trivial example, I agree the strings would work well, but I=\r\n&#39;d still have different test methods for the second reason I mention below:=\r\n\n \nFor the majority of examples there will be some amount of setup. Using m=\r\nultiple methods along with the setUp/tearDown (@Before/@After) feature of J=\r\nUnit allows for test isolation. In this trivial example, it is not necessar=\r\ny.\n \nHowever, there is the issue of equivalence sets. In the original examp=\r\nles, the person was validating different logical test scenarios and I would=\r\n argue those should be in different test methods. I would also argue that t=\r\nhe last two examples were in the same equivalence set (is that the right te=\r\nrm?) and so the third test was useless. So from the original example, there=\r\n should have been 2 tests, one for a successful use and one for a failed us=\r\ne. Furthermore, the failed example should have been written to assertFalse =\r\ninstead of true to move the overall example to more of a automated one. Thi=\r\ns last point is overkill for the example provided, so in this case I&#39;d prob=\r\nably build one unit test.\n \nFinally, \nTutorials and Articles\n     http://sc=\r\nhuchert.wikispaces.com/\n\n\n\n----- Original Message ----\nFrom: C=C3=A9dric Be=\r\nust =E2=99=94 &lt;cbeust@...&gt;\nTo: junit@yahoogroups.com\nSent: Sunday, J=\r\nune 18, 2006 8:38:15 PM\nSubject: Re: [junit] Multiple assertions per test\n\n=\r\n\nOn 6/18/06, Brett L. Schuchert &lt;schuchert@yahoo. com&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; A unit =\r\ntest should test one thing. Let&#39;s say you WANT to get multiple\n&gt; results. W=\r\nhat&#39;s the UI for that? And besides the UI, what&#39;s even the point?\n&gt; We&#39;re t=\r\nrying to write tests in a way that requires nearly 0 human\n&gt; interaction. I=\r\nf you can get multiple results from a test, it seems you&#39;d\n&gt; need a person =\r\nto process those results rather than the computer. It goes\n&gt; counter to AUT=\r\nOMATION and moves towards more human intervention.\n\nI&#39;m not sure why wantin=\r\ng multiple results leads to needing human\nintervention. .. Can you expand o=\r\nn that?\n\nThe original example was later answered well by someone else. Make=\r\n\n&gt; testOrder() three tests instead of one. You get the results you want, th=\r\nough\n&gt; you do have to write a few more lines of code.\n\nThe problem with thi=\r\ns approach is not just that it leads to an explosion of\ntest methods, it&#39;s =\r\nthat it decouples code that you obviously want to keep\ntogether. First you =\r\nbreak these three tests in three different methods and\nnext thing you know,=\r\n these three methods become scattered in the class and\nyou completely forge=\r\nt they are testing things that are closely related. And\nmost likely, if you=\r\n change one of these methods, you need to hunt down these\nother methods to =\r\nmodify them too.\n\nI&#39;m not saying that it&#39;s a bad thing to do, just that som=\r\netimes, there are\ngood reasons for wanting these multiple asserts together =\r\nin the same method.\n\n&gt; // Note, in the original test this assert would have=\r\n failed. It should\n&gt; have been written\n&gt; // in a way that would not fail bu=\r\nt still assert what should happen\n&gt; public void testFailure_ DoesNotMatch( =\r\n) {\n&gt; assertNotEqual( 44, Largest.largest( new int[] {8,9,7}));\n&gt; }\n&gt;\n&gt; And=\r\n so on... The name of the test states the intent of the test. I don&#39;t\n&gt; hav=\r\ne to read the code to figure out the intention of what is being tested.\n\nSu=\r\nre, but you can get the same result with strings, which are even more\nreada=\r\nble:\n\nassert 44 !=3D Larget.largest( new int[] { 8, 9, 7}) : &quot;The largest i=\r\ntem should\nnot be 44&quot;.\n\n&lt;snip&gt;\n\nAgree with the rest of your message.\n\n-- \nC=\r\n=C3=A9dric\nhttp://testng. org\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been=\r\n removed]\n\n\n \n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\n\n",
