I&#39;m following the exact same \nstructure recommended in the book called &quot;Java Development with Ant&quot;.\n\nSo I have something like:\n\nprojects\n     +- src\n     +- build\n     +- test\n      |    +- src\n      |    +- classes\n      |    +- data (xml files)\n      |    +- reports (test results in API style)\n     +- javadoc\n\nI hope my little textual diagram doesn&#39;t get too screwed up on your \nemail clients.\n\nAt Sun we have several diffent layers of testing so the install gets \ntested without the need for my own testing code. We have QA testers in \nIndia who perform regression testing, load testing, and some other stuff.\n\nI guess the decision of whether or not to include test code in a \nproduction distribution depends on the customers and the type of IT shop \nwe&#39;re dealing with.\n\nCharles\nChip Dunning wrote:\n\n&gt; When I first started using JUnit (which is very recent) I built my \n&gt; folders using a &#92;src&#92;main and src&#92;test directory structure. That way I \n&gt; could put the test code into the same packages, but use Ant to strip \n&gt; it out of the final build. I do the same with the documentation that I \n&gt; generate. We use Javadocs to generate internal documentation only, ant \n&gt; runs the javadoc but doesn&#39;t include that into the released jar.\n&gt;       Our drive to remove the code was two-fold. (1) To keep the jar \n&gt; as small as possible because we are sometimes pushing this code over \n&gt; 33.6k lines to rather out of the way places. (2) Word from the \n&gt; mountain was that test code and javadocs are considered internal code \n&gt; only and could not be included in the final customer jars.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Chip\n&gt; -----\n&gt; &quot;I&#39;m sure looters don&#39;t call it looting. They probably think of it as \n&gt; Extreme Shopping&quot; --George Carlin\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; From: Charles Hayes [mailto:charles.hayes@...]\n&gt; Sent: Friday, January 30, 2004 12:44 PM\n&gt; To: junit@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Subject: Re: [junit] your opinion needed: package for unit testing codes\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; I would tend to agree with Veny.
