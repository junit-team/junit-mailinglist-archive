Short answer is I<br/>\nthink Agitator & JUnit are complementary TDD or no. (I&#39;ll leave it to<br/>\nsomeone else to make the point that of course you should use TDD.  I<br/>\nagree with them, but that isn&#39;t your question.)<br/>\n<br/>\nLonger answer is that when you use JUnit TDD there are (at least) two<br/>\ndifferent kinds of value you get, design and correctness. It is the<br/>\ncorrectness aspect that Robert Martin is talking about when he<br/>\ncompares TDD to double entry bookkeeping. It answers the question<br/>\n&quot;does my algorithm work? does input a combined with input b give me<br/>\nexactly output c?&quot; JUnit tests give you this kind of confidence.<br/>\n<br/>\nAgitator is more about limits and bounds and did your algorithm, which<br/>\nyou already know works correctly on the happy path, unexpectedly blow<br/>\nup in some cases. Or leave the object in an illegal state? Or return a<br/>\nnon-sensical value? or... Agitation is also good for &quot;does input of<br/>\ncategory A with input of category B always give me output of category<br/>\nC?&quot; If I were looking for a word to compare to correctness I&#39;d<br/>\nprobably have to choose robustness.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo would I recommend JUnit + Agitator over just simply Agitator?  Heck<br/>\nyeah! and I&#39;ve already done so many times on (both in person and on my<br/>\nblog) already.  :)<br/>\n<br/>\nJtf</div>",
