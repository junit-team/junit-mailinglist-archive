When I chose it in early 2004, the landscape of open source coverage tools was pretty sparse.  I evaluated EMMA, jcoverage, and groboutils.  At that time JCoverage didn&#39;t work well for us -- it couldn&#39;t handle our large codebase.  Groboutils was slooow.\n\nEMMA was fast, had good docs, was easy to integrate into our ant build scripts, and had responsive support.  The reports are &quot;OK&quot;; I like clover&#39;s better, but did not want to pay $$$.  Having said that, the reports are good enough for us and provide a green/yellow/red line-based view of your java source files showing what lines were fully/partially/non executed.  The ant tasks provide easy customization of the reports.  \n\nI recommend EMMA highly.\n\nI&#39;ve not looked at cobertura.\n\nJohn\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: jason r tibbetts [mailto:tibbettj@...]\nSent: Thursday, February 23, 2006 7:53 AM\nTo: junit@yahoogroups.com\nSubject: Re: [junit] Code coverage analysis with JUnit\n\n\nAnderson John-QA2554 wrote:\n&gt;  \n&gt; Has anyone integrated and used JUnit and EMMA on a large scale\n&gt; commercial product?  If so, were you satisfied with EMMA as a code\n&gt; coverage analysis tool?  \n&gt; \n&gt; Is there a better open source code coverage analysis tool available that\n&gt; works with JUnit? \n&gt; \n&gt; Are there a better commercial code coverage analysis tools available\n&gt; that work with JUnit? \n\nI&#39;ve used the GPL&#39;d jcoverage, cobertura (a more up-to-date rewrite of \njcoverage), and EMMA. Of the three, I prefer cobertura for its clean \nlayout. EMMA&#39;s output looks quite clunky, even though it does provide a \nbit more information than the other two.\n\n\n \nYahoo!
