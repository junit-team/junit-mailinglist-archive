What do you expect\n&gt; to see happening? Log4j is logging to the console - ANT captures the\n&gt; console output and will display it in-line as part of the normal\n&gt; output.\n&gt; \n\nI expect that output sent to System.out directly and output sent to\nSystem.out via log4j act in the same manner.  This seems like a\nreasonable expectation to me.  Currently, the log4j messages go to the\nactual console and the direct System.out messages are captured by the\n&lt;junit&gt; task.\n\n&gt; If the unit tests use System.out (why?), this will be available as\n&gt; part of the content sent to the formatters that you specify, since I\n&gt; believe that the junit task wraps System.out and System.err to log the\n&gt; output.\n\nThe System.out usage of the unit tests wasn&#39;t exactly intentional. :-)\n\n&gt; \n&gt; I think that a clumsy workaround might be to log the log4j output to a\n&gt; file, maybe using an XML appender and then using the ant xslt or style\n&gt; task to post-process the junit output and the log4j output.\n&gt; \n\nInteresting idea, but I think it would be difficult to associate the\nright output to the right test cases.  (I run &lt;junit&gt; on a whole\nbunch of tests at once.)\n\nI can&#39;t imagine that I am doing something unusual here, in the sense\nof that I have unit tests that use log4j and I invoke them in a batch\nvia the ant &lt;junit&gt; task.  What are other people doing in this situation?\n\nThanks,\nRay\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
