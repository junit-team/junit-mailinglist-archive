In the spirit of the thing he was\n&gt; &gt; thinking of calling it\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;Thatcher :-)  We were talking about it with a\n&gt; few\n&gt; &gt; other people who, like\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;me, are very annoyed by the fact that private\n&gt; gets\n&gt; &gt; in the way when its\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;in someone else&#39;s mangled code and you don&#39;t\n&gt; have\n&gt; &gt; the opportunity to\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;peel it off, and we thought, well, wouldn&#39;t it\n&gt; be\n&gt; &gt; nice if your\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;environment just told you which methods weren&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; used elsewhere in the\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;system?  Sort of, &quot;this one could be private if\n&gt; &gt; you wanted it to be.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;    \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Michael,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Very interesting.  Are you suggesting this tool\n&gt; &gt; would allow you to\n&gt; &gt; &gt;make more things private, or allow you to leave\n&gt; &gt; fewer things private,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;while still having the documentary benefit from\n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; IDE of an &quot;only\n&gt; &gt; &gt;used locally&quot; marker?\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; You could use it either way and as long as a\n&gt; &gt; language has private, \n&gt; &gt; people would probably move to one or the other\n&gt; &gt; style.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I think that the core issue behind all of this is\n&gt; &gt; what we choose to \n&gt; &gt; think of as the program.  For languages like Java\n&gt; &gt; which are file-based, \n&gt; &gt; that have representation outside the IDE, I\n&gt; suppose\n&gt; &gt; there will always be \n&gt; &gt; people who want to see those semantics in the\n&gt; &gt; source.  The thing that is \n&gt; &gt; interesting to consider, though, is that if our\n&gt; IDEs\n&gt; &gt; can infer this \n&gt; &gt; information, is there much merit in the idea of\n&gt; &gt; having the programmer \n&gt; &gt; specify it?  Could it be enough to say, well, you\n&gt; &gt; can access whatever \n&gt; &gt; you want, but the uses will be immediately\n&gt; apparent\n&gt; &gt; when people look at \n&gt; &gt; the code.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Typing &#39;private&#39; is a like a little ritual.  You\n&gt; are\n&gt; &gt; documenting a \n&gt; &gt; decision.  But, if you have control over the code,\n&gt; &gt; you can &quot;untype&quot; it \n&gt; &gt; whenever you want to.  This is pretty much the\n&gt; same\n&gt; &gt; as having the IDE \n&gt; &gt; infer it for you.  The only way that private has\n&gt; &gt; teeth is when you don&#39;t \n&gt; &gt; have control over the code that uses it.  And, as\n&gt; a\n&gt; &gt; guy who runs into \n&gt; &gt; testing dilemmas all the time, I have to say that\n&gt; &gt; those teeth feel very \n&gt; &gt; sharp.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; One way out of this might be to let IDEs manage\n&gt; &gt; private the way that \n&gt; &gt; Eclipse manages imports.  I haven&#39;t thought that\n&gt; &gt; through yet.. might be \n&gt; &gt; neat though.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Michael Feathers\n&gt; &gt; http://www.objectmentor.com\n&gt; &gt; http://michaelfeathers.typepad.com\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt;\n____________________________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Now that&#39;s room service!
