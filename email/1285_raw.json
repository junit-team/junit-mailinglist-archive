In this case, the algorithm and any \n&gt; refinements would be represented by their own class and would\ntherefore be \n&gt; testable in their own right.\n\nI found this comment (and Ilja&#39;s, who made essentially the same point)\nquite interesting.  Two issues come up, though.\n\nFirst, the Strategy Pattern buys you some flexibility at the cost of\nsome added complexity.  You could read the principle of YAGNI as\nsaying don&#39;t pay for the flexibility until you know you need it.  If I\ndon&#39;t have any real reason to believe that I&#39;m likely to swap in a new\nalgorithm later, then moving the algorithm into its own class could be\nseen as overkill.  (There are still, however, plenty of reasons to\nencapsulate it in its own method, like readability and coherence.) \nMoving it into its own class does buy you something in simplifying the\ntesting, though, so is that (up-front, immediate) benefit sufficient\nto justify the cost of the pattern?\n\nThe other issue is that there&#39;s probably some sort of spectrum here,\nwith little tiny methods on the one hand and big complex algorithms on\nthe other.  The tiny methods can probably be private and not directly\ntested (although that&#39;s not entirely obvious), and the big guys\nprobably can/should be pulled out into their own classes.  In between,\nthough, it would seem that there are (private, helper) methods that\naren&#39;t big enough to justify their own class, but are still big enough\nthat you&#39;d want to test them independently.\n\n\tNic\n\n\n\n",
