Perhaps<br/>\n  every heretofore uncharted business domain may provide<br/>\n  artistic freedom for a software developer, but pretty soon,<br/>\n  it becomes yet another &quot;patternizable&quot;, &quot;automated testable&quot;<br/>\n  piece of software.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt;  From what I understand the goal of CMM is to define a <br/>\n&gt; process that even <br/>\n&gt; a monkey could follow. Monkeys do not write software; people do.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>  perhaps the monkey refers to &quot;code monkeys&quot;...<br/>\n  Again, my point is that a large part of software being built today<br/>\n  is grunt-work, which can and should be codified in a process.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; It drives towards more uniform results, certainly; but I don&#39;t know <br/>\n&gt; about &quot;better software&quot;.<br/>\n  <br/>\n </span></blockquote>  At the end, if you&#39;re saying the concept of the CMM is BS, I don&#39;t<br/>\nagree. The very fact that we&#39;re using JUnit and other tools to <br/>\ncomplement our laziness (laziness being a compliment, of course, in<br/>\nsoftware development) is evidence that we are trying to get from<br/>\nInitial to Repeatable (this word is JUnit all the way) to Defined<br/>\nto Managed to Optimized (refactor mercilessly).<br/>\nif you&#39;re saying the process (documentation, documentation and more<br/>\ndocumentation) is flawed, I&#39;m with you.<br/>\n<br/>\nFinally, I just took a look at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.sei.cmu.edu\">http://www.sei.cmu.edu</a> and found out <br/>\nthat they&#39;re sunsetting the CMM and moving to CMMI, so maybe they<br/>\ndid find out that most people out here cared two hoots about the<br/>\nprocess...<br/>\n<br/>\nregards,<br/>\nNilesh</div>",
