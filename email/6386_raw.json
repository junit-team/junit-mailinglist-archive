Part of the reason\nfor this is that if one test fails, you can re-run it during your\ndebugging to see if you&#39;ve made progress fixing the problem.\n\nIf your tests aren&#39;t independent, you&#39;ll have to have some way of\ndocumenting which test&#39;s side effect allows your other test(s) to be\nrun.\n\nAs you point out, though, there&#39;s clearly a cost involved in making all\nyour tests independent, and use the &#39;setup() and teardown()&#39; methods. \nIf this cost is prohibitive, you may want to consider changing those\ntests that are currently separate, interrelated tests to be one\nindependent test.  (I&#39;d to this by renaming your current interrelated\ntest methods to be private helper methods, and have a larger &#39;test&#39;\nmethod call them in the order you want).\n\nThis is the approach I&#39;ve been taking, and its simplified things a\ngreat deal both in my own process, and when people use tests I&#39;ve\nwritten.\n\n-Kevin Klinemeier\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nNew DSL Internet Access from SBC & Yahoo!\nhttp://sbc.yahoo.com\n\n\n",
