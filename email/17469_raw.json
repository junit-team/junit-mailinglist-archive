I believe it can be done, but I haven&#39;t found anything in JUnit\n&gt; Recipes I can use to convince him.\n&gt;\n&gt; Can somebody give me ammunition for this task?

Domain\n(business) objects that are easily testable and a very thin GUI that\nis difficult to test beats a thick GUI that&#39;s difficult to test.\n\nSomeone else will have to advise you about the best GUI testing tools.\nI&#39;ve never needed to use one.\n\nSimon\n\n-- \nwww.simonpeter.org\n\n",
