For example \n&gt; all files that have a &quot;Test&quot; in their names.\n&gt; &gt; - a TestCase is only executed if it has at least one \n&gt; &quot;test...&quot; method (otherwise a warning is raised)\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The TestCollector doesn&#39;t parse the file to see if it has a \n&gt; &quot;test&quot; method.  At least no TestCollector found in the \n&gt; official release.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; To summarize:\n&gt; &gt; - your TestCase must implement at least one method \n&gt; beginning with &quot;test&quot;\n&gt; &gt; - in order to use the standard TestCollector (but you can \n&gt; write your own) your TestCase must contain &quot;Test&quot; in its name\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Now we have deviated from the original topic.  I have a \n&gt; _TestSuite_ that is not\n&gt; being executed as a test suite.  It is included with a number \n&gt; of other tests,\n&gt; gathered by Ant&#39;s junit task.  Currently, I am trying to run \n&gt; it through the\n&gt; junit.swingui.TestRunner class--but it also is treating my \n&gt; TestSUITE as a TestCase.\n&gt; That is not cool.  If I take the time to write a TestSuite, I \n&gt; want it to be run\n&gt; as a suite--not a case.\n&gt; \n&gt; ------------------------ Yahoo!
