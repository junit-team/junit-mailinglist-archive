Let&#39;s take a<br/>\nlook...<br/>\n<br/>\n(I love flight management systems!  They were always so fun and challenging.  Of<br/>\ncourse, we didn&#39;t have Java back then.)<br/>\n<br/>\npublic class ItinBuilder {<br/>\n<br/>\n    public void buildItins(segment[] segs);<br/>\n    private sortByDptrDate();<br/>\n    private identifyDupeSegs();<br/>\n    private createUniqueItins();<br/>\n    private createAllItins();<br/>\n}<br/>\n<br/>\nPerhaps sortByDptrDate() could take an array of Segments(?) and return them in<br/>\nsorted order.  The buildItins() methods might then use that, but it&#39;s available to<br/>\nother clients as well.  It&#39;s probably even more testable that way, as you could<br/>\nmock up a collection of Segments and assert that they were returned in sorted<br/>\norder.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not sure, but the code seems to want more parameters and return values.  You<br/>\nknow the implementation better than I, and there&#39;s no right or wrong answer here.<br/>\nIt&#39;s design, after all, and you are the world&#39;s leading authority on where you<br/>\nwant your design to go.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is just what I do when faced with a private/protected method I want to test.<br/>\nI see if it really wants to be a public method to add more value from the client&#39;s<br/>\nperspective.  If it doesn&#39;t want to go public, I default to protected access and<br/>\nmy tests are in the same package (different directory).<br/>\n<br/>\nMike<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nMike Clark<br/>\nClarkware Consulting, Inc.<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.clarkware.com\">http://www.clarkware.com</a><br/>\n720.851.2014</div>",
