One might get really\n&gt; confused by the mixture of different conventions (as I did, having\n&gt; started the research).\n&gt; \n&gt; If you want to focus on the newest version od JUnit, watch out reading\n&gt; the tutorials. As I said, the two versions have totally different\n&gt; naming conventions, the older one being deprecated by the new one.\n&gt; Here&#39;s a brilliant advice on how to recognize the two styles:\n&gt; http://www.instrumentalservices.com/content/view/45/52/\n&gt; \n&gt; Sad but true, if I hadn&#39;t found that very article, I would still be\n&gt; confused. Even though the docs attached to the downloadable version of\n&gt; JUnit 4.0 cover the new convention, the samples are still unchanged.\n&gt; \n&gt; Have fun learning, as I&#39;m having for a few days :)\n\nThis is an excellent point. I have just changed my tutorial to emphasize \nthe fact that it is for JUnit 3.x.\n\nThank you for the feedback.\n-- \nJ. B.
