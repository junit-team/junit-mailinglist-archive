In my case, the inner classes are to be instantiated along with the enclosing class when the enclosing class is run, but never instantiated and run on their own.  I ended up accomplishing this via the AllTests runner and suite() methods that adapt the enclosing class and inner class instances as JUnit 3.8-style Test adapters.  I also wanted to tie the inner class instances to a specific enclosing class instance, because the inner classes use fixture fields from an enclosing instance.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt looks as though the requirement for JDave inner class contexts is that they be instantiable and runnable on their own, independent of their sibling contexts -- and that the requestor would have liked for such contexts to adopt whatever Runner a @RunWith on the enclosing class might have specified.<br/>\n<br/>\nOff the top of my head, I can&#39;t think of a clean way for JUnit to support both strategies in the core proper.<br/>\n<br/>\nI may try satisfying my specific use case in another way, perhaps using an as-yet-developed kind of Runner.  The AllTests way still seems a bit icky, but works for now.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\nPaul Holser</div>",
