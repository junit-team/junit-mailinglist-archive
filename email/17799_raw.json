However, as the system starts  \nto get complicated those simple constructors sometimes become  \ncomplications because of the need to have mocks for unit tests. Later  \nthey become even greater complications because of the need to break  \nor invert dependencies between modules.\n\nThis does not mean that you should avoid all simple constructors.   \nThat would be silly and pointless.  What it does mean is that all  \nprogrammers should be adept at the various techniques for quickly  \nconverting from simple constructors to simple polymorphic  \nconstructors.  It also means that all programmers should understand  \nthe issues of intermodule dependencies and how to manage them (which  \nis what OO is really all about).\n\n\n----\nRobert C.
