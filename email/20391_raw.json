There is a single publ=\r\nic \nparse method that returns an instance of this object. Inside this \npubl=\r\nic parse method several private helper methods are called. \nBasically the j=\r\nob of the public method is to call the private helper \nmethods in the corre=\r\nct sequence, based on the contents of the file \nbeing parsed.\n\nHere is my q=\r\nuestion: I want to verify that the logic in parts of \nthese private helper =\r\nmethods does what I intend. Although I know a \nfailure of any of these &quot;log=\r\nic parts&quot; in a private helper method \nwould be reflected in a failure of th=\r\ne public method. However, I want \nto pinpoint which of the &quot;logic parts&quot; fa=\r\niling.\n\nHave I left the realm of unit testing and moved on to some type of =\r\n\nfunctional testing? Do I need to refactor these &quot;logic parts&quot; into \ntheir =\r\nown private methods, and then use a framework like JUnitX to \ntest these pr=\r\nivate methods? Do I write some beanshell scripts that \ntest this logic inst=\r\nead?\n\nThanks for any suggestions on how to proceed. I know this problem is =\r\n\ndue to my lack of experience with software testing, and is not a \nproblem =\r\nwith JUnit.\n\nThe Sunburned Surveyor\n\n\n",
