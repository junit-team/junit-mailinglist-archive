I\nsuppose I&#39;ll have to go find  a Maven plugin for other types of tests as\nwell now :)\n\nI&#39;m also beginning to think that integration testing is of great importance,\nespecially since my projects are getting quite complicated (simulated\ncompilers and such for University). Thus my interest. I think I&#39;ll\ndefinitely check out the relative merits of trying first a simple JUnit\napproach to intergration testing and then trying the TestNG route.\n\nThanks for the tips regarding User Acceptance testing. I was pretty sure\nJUnit isn&#39;t the right approach here. I&#39;ll check out those tools, since I\nconcur about readability - especially for agile shops.\n\nAs for getting the &#39;feel&#39; of TDD, I know exactly what you mean. I&#39;ve learned\na lot over the past year or so of using it, and it&#39;s sped up my development\nefforts greatly.\n\nThanks again,\nJan.\n\n2008/9/2 Dennis Lloyd Jr &lt;dennislloydjr@...&gt;\n\n&gt;   Hi Jan,\n&gt; I won&#39;t claim to be the official position of the JUnit community, but I\n&gt; will\n&gt; offer my thoughts.\n&gt;\n&gt; It is okay to use JUnit for other kinds of testing, however I avoid putting\n&gt; my unit tests and integration or system tests in the same source folders.\n&gt; The reason for this is, I&#39;d rather be able to run my unit tests very\n&gt; frequently and therefore they need to be very fast. Separating them allows\n&gt; me to pick what to run.\n&gt;\n&gt; Honestly, I&#39;ve been giving some thought to the concept of integration\n&gt; testing and wondering myself where it fits in (after some thought-provoking\n&gt; comments from Joe Rainsberger). Right now my thinking is that it is a\n&gt; valuable testing practice to do white-box integration testing and\n&gt; automating\n&gt; those tests using a tool such as JUnit is probably a good idea. However,\n&gt; I&#39;m\n&gt; not sure that TDD integration testing is the right thing - anyone else have\n&gt; thoughts on this? (Maybe I should start another thread...)\n&gt;\n&gt; As for user acceptance tests, I try not to do these in JUnit at all. The\n&gt; reason is, I want the user to be able to read them. Therefore, I use tools\n&gt; such as Fitnesse, and now I&#39;m trying out Concordian.\n&gt;\n&gt; Ultimately you&#39;ll need to find what works for you and your team, and you&#39;ll\n&gt; probably change your strategy several times as you learn the &#39;feel&#39; of TDD.\n&gt; It takes some time to learn, but has been the most valuable practice I&#39;ve\n&gt; found in software design. Welcome to TDD.\n&gt;\n&gt; Hope this helps!\n&gt; -Dennis\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; On 9/2/08, Jan Kroeze &lt;thejcwk@... &lt;thejcwk%40gmail.com&gt;&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Hi all!\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m a bit of a newb to the whole TDD thing, but I understand that unit\n&gt; &gt; tests\n&gt; &gt; are supposed to be blazingly fast and not access the hard drive, network,\n&gt; &gt; database or anything external to the code itself. To this end, I\n&gt; understand\n&gt; &gt; that a framework such as jMock can be used.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; So far, so good. But I find JUnit to be extremely useful for writing\n&gt; &gt; integration, system and user acceptance tests as well.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Here&#39;s my question: what is the official position of the JUnit community\n&gt; on\n&gt; &gt; using JUnit to do larger scale tests? Is there a better framework, or is\n&gt; it\n&gt; &gt; common practice to use JUnit for these tests as well?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; --\n&gt; &gt; Jan Kroeze\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\n\n\n-- \nJan Kroeze\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n",
