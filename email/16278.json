My attitude has always been the same: if it &quot;cannot&quot; <br/>\nchange, then I guess the people involved don&#39;t think it very important <br/>\nto test it.<br/>\n<br/>\nBy the way, this is not a JUnit limitation. It&#39;s a Java limitation. <br/>\nSince the method is protected, a TestCase in the same /package/ would be <br/>\nable to invoke it directly. Again, this is not a JUnit limitation, it&#39;s <br/>\nthe way Java works.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the unavoidable facts of testing (any kind of testing) existing <br/>\ncode is that much code is designed in a way that makes testing difficult <br/>\nor expensive. If you want to test it effectively, it will have to start <br/>\nchanging.<br/>\n<br/>\nElliotte Harold is the poster boy (and I mean that in a good way!) for <br/>\nhaving both a minimal API and well-tested code. I don&#39;t feel quite as <br/>\nstrongly about having a minimal API, but then I don&#39;t publish libraries <br/>\nmuch, so I don&#39;t have external motivation to care as much about it. He <br/>\nhas shown that you /can/ have both, but you probably can&#39;t get there <br/>\nwithout making some changes to existing APIs.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo it&#39;s your choice: which do you value more? The API as it is now, or <br/>\nwriting good tests? If you value the first one more, you&#39;ll have to <br/>\nsettle for longer, more brittle, more expensive tests. That&#39;s a judgment <br/>\nonly your team can make.<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJ. B.
