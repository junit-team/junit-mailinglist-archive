Don&#39;t break the build. Team size really doesn&#39;t enter into \nit. To some extent this is cultural. if the team culture allows people \nto check in code that breaks previously working tests, then yes. \nDebugging will, be tougher, though I fail to see how distinguishing \nbetween skipped and errored tests will help. Indeed, sometimes it&#39;s not \neven the first failed test that makes the problem the most obvious. The \nmore failed tests you have the more and better the opportunities for \ndebugging. If one failed test does not have an obvious cause, then try \nthe next one. You&#39;re just throwing away potentially useful information \nby offering only one failure.\n\nFurthermore, in a team larger than one, I find it even more unlikely \nthat anyone can untangle the web of dependencies accurately enough to \nfigure out what tests depend on the functionality tested by which other \ntests.\n\n-- \nElliotte Rusty Harold  elharo@...\nXML in a Nutshell 3rd Edition Just Published!\nhttp://www.cafeconleche.org/books/xian3/\nhttp://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0596007647/cafeaulaitA/ref=nosim\n\n",
