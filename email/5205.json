B. Rainsberger&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jbr@...\">jbr@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nwrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; hehehehe....sorry you&#39;re sounding like Ron, not<br/>\n&gt; sure I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; can help there ;)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; You could shoot me.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Thinking about it more, I guess I&#39;d have to agree<br/>\n&gt; with<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the thinking that the people working with you<br/>\n&gt; *should*<br/>\n&gt; &gt; know better and do the right thing.  If they<br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; you replace them.  Unfortunately, this isn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; always<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the case (at least where I&#39;ve been) so I&#39;ve had to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; develop some defensive coding technique.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Exactly; and so the question has to be asked: why<br/>\n&gt; the hell not?! Removing <br/>\n&gt; doesn&#39;t necessarily mean firing; it can mean<br/>\n&gt; reassigning to another <br/>\n&gt; department, changing role, and so on. I firmly<br/>\n&gt; believe that any seemingly <br/>\n&gt; entirely incompetent person is really just someone<br/>\n&gt; in the wrong role. This <br/>\n&gt; notion is reinforced at least once per project.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I need to find projects with fewer idiots. :)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>AGREED! :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Also, from your remark about having to change code<br/>\n&gt; &gt; because of the checked versus unchecked<br/>\n&gt; exceptions, it<br/>\n&gt; &gt; sounded like you were merely moaning about some<br/>\n&gt; part<br/>\n&gt; &gt; of your body hurting.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &quot;Doctor, it hurts when I declare which exceptions<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m going to throw...&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Using unchecked exceptions appears to pass the<br/>\n&gt; &quot;doctor, it hurts...&quot; test!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; I, for one, don&#39;t mind having<br/>\n&gt; &gt; to go through and change a bunch of code because<br/>\n&gt; of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; some refactoring I&#39;m doing.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I don&#39;t consider the exception list &quot;code&quot;. Maybe<br/>\n&gt; that&#39;s the reason we don&#39;t <br/>\n&gt; quite agree on this one. I see it as part of the<br/>\n&gt; contract, and I&#39;m not <br/>\n&gt; accustomed to explicitly state contracts. To me,<br/>\n&gt; that&#39;s what the tests are <br/>\n&gt; for. If I were a heavy-duty Design by Contract guy,<br/>\n&gt; I might think differently.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Ah, that could be.  Not sure what camp I fall in to at<br/>\nthe moment...(more reading?  screw that, I&#39;m going to<br/>\ngo code some tests..hahah)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; If *all I&#39;m changing* are method signatures, that&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; crappy. Period.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Really, on the whole, I would tend to agree with<br/>\n&gt; you. <br/>\n&gt; &gt; I mainly wanted to get that viewpoint out there to<br/>\n&gt; get<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the discussion a little broader, just in case<br/>\n&gt; anyone<br/>\n&gt; &gt; was thinking that the unchecked exceptions were<br/>\n&gt; the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; end all, be all of coding (in Java anyway).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; If they follow the Wiki link, they should get ample<br/>\n&gt; helpings of both sides of <br/>\n&gt; the issue. :)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Fear (of my crappy code and/or design) makes me<br/>\n&gt; write<br/>\n&gt; &gt; tests.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Me, too.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Fear (of my coworkers or even sometimes of myself)<br/>\n&gt; &gt; makes me tend to use checked versus unchecked<br/>\n&gt; &gt; exceptions.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Fear of wasting my time makes me tend to use<br/>\n&gt; unchecked versus checked <br/>\n&gt; exceptions. :)<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Mindkiller?  Sure...but as long as the fear is<br/>\n&gt; &gt; controlled, and you use the response productively,<br/>\n&gt; it<br/>\n&gt; &gt; can be a good thing. ;)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Fear is good, but only in moderation.<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; &gt; P.S. Ah, something else I just thought of after<br/>\n&gt; &gt; re-reading.  We are also using exceptions for flow<br/>\n&gt; &gt; control on occasion (for the web-based app we&#39;re<br/>\n&gt; &gt; converting from VB).  In those instances, the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; exception is thrown and we absolutely must notify<br/>\n&gt; the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; user and/or do something about it to recover.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I can see where a compile test for that situation<br/>\n&gt; would seem better than a <br/>\n&gt; runtime test, but I think I prefer the runtime<br/>\n&gt; tests, all things being equal.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --<br/>\n&gt; J.
