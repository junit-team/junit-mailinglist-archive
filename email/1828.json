I don&#39;t do code for &quot;consumers&quot; style end-users.<br/>\nMore like a system that is put into production at some point, not an app<br/>\ninstalled on a desktop. Having a special hook in the app to enable running<br/>\nunit tests on production hardware & software setup might prove valuable when<br/>\nyou suspect a problem with a JVM for example.<br/>\n<br/>\n I totally agree with what Michael expressed below. In my case, I currently<br/>\nwork for an IT departement that wants to maintain the code on it&#39;s own after<br/>\nthe project (so &quot;source code is provided&quot;). They are buying code, and we<br/>\ngive them tests as an added bonus. As for bandwith & storage, I think it is<br/>\na moot point. How much for a 20 Gig theses days? If the code is not an<br/>\napplet, I don&#39;t see why it would generate bandwith loss more than me<br/>\ndownloading mp3s  ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nmathieu<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: Michael Silverstein<br/>\n<br/>\nDefinitely if source code is provided, including test cases make sense. I<br/>\nthink we all agree now that within the context of end-user application<br/>\ndeployment, it doesn&#39;t make sense to include test cases, except for special<br/>\ndiagnostic circumstances. If a product deliverable includes source code, or<br/>\nis a framework that provides a set of Java APIs, then a set of test cases is<br/>\ninvaluable for documenting and validating product usage. </span></blockquote></div>",
