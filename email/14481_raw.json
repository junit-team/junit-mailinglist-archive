Therefore, make sure that the JUnit installation directory is in the CLASSPATH. \n\nTo use the textual test runner, type: \njava junit.textui.TestRunner junit.samples.AllTests \nTo use the graphical test runner, type: \njava junit.swingui.TestRunner junit.samples.AllTests \nAll the tests should pass with an &quot;OK&quot; (textual runner) or a green bar (graphical runner). If the tests don&#39;t pass, verify that junit.jar is in the CLASSPATH. \n\nStep 2: Write a Test Case \n\nFirst, we&#39;ll write a test case to exercise a single software component. We&#39;ll focus on writing tests that exercise the component behavior that has the highest potential for breakage, thereby maximizing our return on testing investment. \n\nTo write a test case, follow these steps: \n\n   \nDefine a subclass of TestCase. \n\n   \nOverride the setUp() method to initialize object(s) under test. \n\n   \nOptionally override the tearDown() method to release object(s) under test. \n\n   \nDefine one or more public testXXX() methods that exercise the object(s) under test and assert expected results. \n \n \n \nif ur using eclipse it&#39;s very simple to install and working with junit.\n \nstep 1:\n \nopen eclipse\ngoto project&gt;properties&gt;java build path&gt; add external jars&gt; give ur jar file location where it is.\n \nstep 2:\nwrite test case file&gt;new&gt;junit TestCase\n \n \nok\n\n\n \nThanks,\nvenkateswarareddy.\n\n\n   \n\nsaravanan.thirugnanam@... wrote:\n\nHi,\nCould u please quote what problem you are facing so that we can suggest a\nsolution ?\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n\nhi All\n\nI am Harish , just now i joined this group.
