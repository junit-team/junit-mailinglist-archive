The only difference between the TestRunners in it\nand 3.2 are that the Loading version are gone, and the regular\njunit.swingui.TestRunner and junit.ui.TestRunner have that functionality\nbuilt into them.\n\nBTW, the excluded.properties file should be inside junit.jar. Just extract\nthat, update that file, and readd it to the jar. Now that you have 3.4,\nhowever, kindly disregard this paragraph :)\n\nHappy to help,\nbab\n\n----\nBrian Button       bbutton@...\nSenior Consultant  Object Mentor, Inc.\nSt. Louis, MO      http://www.objectmentor.com\n\n&gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; From: Andrew Clarke [mailto:andrew.clarke@...]\n&gt; Sent: Wednesday, January 10, 2001 10:36 AM\n&gt; To: junit@egroups.com\n&gt; Subject: RE: [junit] JUnit tests raise NoClassDefFoundError with log4j\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Brian\n&gt;\n&gt; I was using 3.2.  I&#39;ve had a look in the FAQ and found the\n&gt; relevant passage.\n&gt; The problem is I can&#39;t find the\n&gt; junit.util.excluded.properties file so that\n&gt; I can exclude log4j. Where ought it to be?\n&gt;\n&gt; Incidentally, I&#39;ve now downloaded Junit 3.4 which I was going to use\n&gt; instead.  However the sourceforge download doesn&#39;t have any of the\n&gt; TestRunner classes.  However some of the postings on this\n&gt; list imply that\n&gt; 3.4 *does* have the UI components.  Where can I find them?\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;m sorry to keep asking questions, I guess I&#39;ve got my stupid head on\n&gt; today.  thanks for your time, APC\n\n\nTo unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\njunit-unsubscribe@egroups.com\n\n\n\n",
