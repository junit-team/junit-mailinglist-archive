I <br/>\nusually have the full suite of tests running on one or more other <br/>\nplatforms in order to parallelize the testing as well as ensure <br/>\ncross-platform consistency.<br/>\n<br/>\nTest timing considerations aside, I think it&#39;d be valuable to have a <br/>\ntool automatically track some sort of test levelization.  I am <br/>\nintimately familiar with the code, but I still don&#39;t keep *everything* <br/>\nin my head and when it comes to tracking complex interdependencies, the <br/>\ncomputer does (or should do) it much better than I can.  That&#39;s why <br/>\nwe&#39;ve got compilers, yes?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Jul 19, 2004, at 6:11 AM, Chris Dollin wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; On Saturday 17 July 2004 05:03, J.

GSBase, for example, runs tests at <br/>\n&gt;&gt; approximately<br/>\n&gt;&gt; 100/second, and that&#39;s my usual performance goal for tests. On my most<br/>\n&gt;&gt; recent project, I separated tests that required expensive, external<br/>\n&gt;&gt; resources (there were about 10) from tests than ran entirely in memory<br/>\n&gt;&gt; (there were about 400). The in-memory tests ran in about 6 seconds.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Is this &quot;noticeable&quot; by your standards?

More like 40s outside Eclipse (and with a working <br/>\n&gt; proxy).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I used to run with a 0.8GHz supposedly-dula processor and we were <br/>\n&gt; talking<br/>\n&gt; more like 120s. (The database tests are separate and take 60s seconds<br/>\n&gt; to run, for mySQL on Linux at least - at one point it was more like <br/>\n&gt; 20minutes,<br/>\n&gt; argh scream; I suspect there aren&#39;t enough of them.)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The test suite is rather a hotchpotch, as it contains ancient tests <br/>\n&gt; from<br/>\n&gt; before our more systematic use of JUnit which are more like acceptance<br/>\n&gt; tests than unit tests, but them&#39;s what we have.
