I suspect you&#39;re referring to p. 343-344. However<br/>\n&gt; you have to remember that Meyer is writing about a language in which<br/>\n&gt; preconditions can be specified *and enforced* outside the body of the<br/>\n&gt; method. Since Java, unlike Eiffel, does not provide extra-method<br/>\n&gt; preconditions it is therefore necessary to place the verification code<br/>\n&gt; in the method body. It&#39;s not ideal, but Java is not an ideal language.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Furthermore, for most cases, Meyer recommends precondition verification<br/>\n&gt; by default. See pp. 394-398<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I am really not convinced that Meyer&#39;s approach, and Design by Contract in<br/>\ngeneral, is really relevant to the real world.  I blogged about it a few<br/>\nyears ago here &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.jroller.com/page/cbeust/20021213\">http://www.jroller.com/page/cbeust/20021213</a>&gt;, and my<br/>\nconclusion was that preconditions, post-conditions and invariants were<br/>\nusually either one of these:<br/>\n<br/>\n   - Super simple, and better put in an assert.<br/>\n   - Super complex, and better left to testing.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also noticed that most of the methods that I write simply don&#39;t have any<br/>\ninvariant that can be easily expressed, so I have yet to see a convincing<br/>\nexample of Design by Contract on a project of more than a few thousands of<br/>\nlines...  (incidentally, most of the Eiffel code that I worked with and read<br/>\nwas pretty bad and wouldn&#39;t pass today&#39;s standards).<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nCédric<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://testng.org\">http://testng.org</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",
