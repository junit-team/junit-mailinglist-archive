I&#39;m not sure these recommendations are actually accepted by\n&gt; anyone except the people promulgating them, though. In particular, what\n&gt; I see is a lot of relatively smart people quietly blaming themselves for\n&gt; not understanding the complexity that&#39;s being foisted on them, and\n&gt; thinking they must be stupid for not understanding it. They may use\n&gt; interfaces when forced to do so by the frameworks, but they don&#39;t like\n&gt; it; and they certainly don&#39;t make it the first choice in their own code.\n\nI do, by the way, seem to leave behind clients, some of whom do a very \ngood job of carrying on the practices I teach them. I don&#39;t know what in \nparticular makes our experiences differ so much.\n\n&gt; Interfaces have their place, but that place has been vastly overdrawn in\n&gt; the Java world. Most classes simply do not need more than one\n&gt; implementation.\n\nCertainly entity classes typically need only one implementation, and \nvalue objects are the same. Infrastructure-related service classes \n(persistence, authorization), though, are typically good candidates for \ninterfaces, even if business-related service class are less so.\n\nSo it&#39;s true that most classes simply do not need more than one \nimplementation. I don&#39;t extract interfaces from most of the classes I write.\n\nTake care.\n-- \nJ. B.
