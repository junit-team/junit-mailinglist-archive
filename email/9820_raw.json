It does this by adding bytecode to the compiled\nclass as it is being loaded.  The software that does this is tested using\nJUnit.  The class that is delivered by the classloader is in fact the main\n&quot;object&quot; of the test fixture.  This class is related to the Java class,\nthe file with the .class extension, but it is not the same.  Among other\nthings, it is much larger :-(\n\nIt is a requirement that the instrumented classes be functionally\nidentical to the original classes.  Many of the unit tests are there to\nconfirm that this is true.\n\nSome of the classes tested are synthesized at run time, so that there is\nno .java source file at all.\n\nIn other words, fixtures can include classes, although they almost always\nconsist only of objects.  However, in my experience, the classes\nthat form part of the fixture are wholly distinct from the TestCase\nclass, although they are created in the setUp() method.\n\nMore details, should anyone be interested, on http://jxcl.sourceforge.net\n\n(JXCL is alpha software, with two known bugs and unsophisticated report\nfacilities.)\n\nOf course, someone with a pronounced and perverse sense of humor might\nwant to have a go at making the TestCase class itself part of the fixture.\n;-)\n\n--\nJim Dixon  jdd@...   tel +44 117 982 0786  mobile +44 797 373 7881\n\n\n",
