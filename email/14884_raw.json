I&#39;d rather conclude that the class\n&gt; file is not was is meant by &quot;class definition&quot; in this case. It&#39;s probably\n&gt; more like an internal representation of the class inside the JVM after the\n&gt; class file got loaded.\n&gt; \n\nI am sure there is a perfectly reasonable &quot;justification&quot; for why a \nClassDefNotFoundError makes sense. But it is misleading.\n\n\nIf a class is not found, the class loader will throw a \nClassNotFoundException. If something goes wrong during static \ninitialization, the VM throws an ExceptionInInitializerException. \nSubsequent attempts to reference the class result in \nNoClassDefFoundError. For some reason, the Error rarely has an error \nmessage that makes any sense.\n\nWe see it all the time in code like this :\n\nstatic {\n   FileReader reader = new FileReader(&quot;my.properties&quot;);\n   ......\n}\n\n\nIt is very confusing to get a NoClassDefFoundError when the class is \ncleary right there. It is also insidious because tool vendors and \nframework providers have to load and run third party code (colloquially, \n/user code/) and have to bullet proof their own code a little more than \nusual. It&#39;s bad practice to catch Throwable, but if you don&#39;t it&#39;s \nlikely that Errors will leak out. We end up catching throwable and \nrethrowing certain Errors.\n\n\nI agree with you that Errors should represent unrecoverable system \nerrors. NoClassDefFoundError is not one of those. Neither is \nOutOfMemoryError nor StackOverflowError.\n\n\nIn the OP&#39;s case, I would wager that a class really was not found and \nthat the ClassNotFoundException caused a static initializer to fail \nwhich caused a ClassDefNotFoundError.\n\nKevin\n\n\n\n\n",
