I am having the pretty much this scenario right now.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think it is related to rules doing fundamental different things:<br/>\n<br/>\n- doing setup/tear down work<br/>\n<br/>\n- doing runtime manipulation of the test execution, like executing it in parallel or in special thread (e.g. Swing EDT)<br/>\n<br/>\n- doing additional assertions like the mentioned Timeout Rule.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you have rules from different groups you need to control the order of things very often.<br/>\n<br/>\nJens<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a>, David Saff &lt;david@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Kent,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve seen several examples in the wild.  Easiest to explain is this: I<br/>\n&gt; have an ExternalResource that starts and stops an expensive server.  I<br/>\n&gt; also have a Timeout rule.  If the Timeout is applied around the<br/>\n&gt; ExternalResource, then I am asserting that server startup + test +<br/>\n&gt; server stopping all happens within the timeout.  If the<br/>\n&gt; ExternalResource is applied around the Timeout, then I am ignoring the<br/>\n&gt; server startup time, and just asserting about the test time.<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>",
