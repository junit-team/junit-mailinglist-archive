Could you elaborate?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It becomes very difficult to formulate expressions as soon as they are more<br/>\ncomplex than a simple equality or inequality.  It&#39;s fine for &quot;n &gt; 2&quot;, not so<br/>\nmuch for &quot;n &gt; 2 && n &lt; 10&quot; and it&#39;s all downhill from there.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Java language also cripples this attempt by not allowing you to re-open<br/>\nexisting classes (you can&#39;t say n.greaterThan(2).and().lessThan(10)), so you<br/>\nare forced to put your words and verbs in a certain order that is dictated<br/>\nby the Java syntax, and not by the developer.<br/>\n<br/>\nQuery API&#39;s suffer from the same problem (e.g. Hibernate&#39;s Criteria API that<br/>\nturns SQL expressions into typed Java objects.  Nothing wrong with<br/>\nHibernate, by the way, this is a problem that&#39;s endemic to Criteria API&#39;s in<br/>\ngeneral).  Past a certain complexity, you&#39;re just better off writing the<br/>\nexpression in terms of boolean and numeric operators, which are very easy to<br/>\nparse for programmers.<br/>\n<br/>\n, and in the end, you&#39;re probably better off simply writing a<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;  method assertButtonIsEnabled(enabled) which, in my opinion, is the most<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  readable of all.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; How does that scale better?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I didn&#39;t say it scaled better (it scales the same), I said it&#39;s the most<br/>\nreadable form because the programmer is free to capture the meaning of the<br/>\nassertion in one word of his choosing, as opposed to literate API&#39;s which,<br/>\ndespite their best efforts, can&#39;t help introducing noise (such as the eq()<br/>\nkeyword in the example above).<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the problems with assertXxxx(String message, Object expected,<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Object actual). Is that it is not obvious where expected and actual<br/>\n&gt; should go.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Agreed, I keep being tripped by this all the time, and I usually have to<br/>\nresort to my IDE&#39;s completion capabilities to refresh my memory.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith the precence of a descriptive message and checking<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; strings for equality it can become even funnier. with<br/>\n&gt; assertThat(Object actual, Expression expression) you simply can&#39;t mix<br/>\n&gt; them (unless actual is also an expression).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve noticed that a lot of people have issues with the asserThat<br/>\n&gt; syntax and I have never been able to quite figure out why.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>These are just my personal objections.  I don&#39;t feel extremely strongly<br/>\nabout this, though, I just wanted to point out that literate assertions<br/>\nsolve a few problems and introduce a few others, so we still haven&#39;t found<br/>\nthe ultimate API solution.  And in the meantime, the introduction of<br/>\nbusiness-specific asserts is the best we can do.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nCédric<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://testng.org\">http://testng.org</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",
