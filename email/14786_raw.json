Hence the control would definitely go to\nsomeParam++. But as Chris pointed out, update to someParam would\nevaporate as soon as someMethod has stopped execution. \nDoesn&#39;t matter to me what the method is precisely doing. All I wanted\nto know was whether for each IF-ELSE, loops , and other constructs in\na method , should we be writing a separate method OR one that takes\ncare of &#39;em all.\n\nThanks for the reply. Keep pouring in more though. As I am still not\nquite clear on this issue.\n\n--- In junit@yahoogroups.com, didoss@c... wrote:\n&gt; Yep,...I would go for two methods as well.\n&gt; \n&gt; If you truly want to test the IF clause, then you also need to test\nwith a few different params being passed in.\n&gt; \n&gt; From that testing, I think you may find that this method doesn&#39;t\nwork as intended,...or I&#39;m not reading the logic correctly.  The way I\nread it, you will always throw the exception, because you can never\nget the state where someParam equals 1 and 2.  [If someParam doesn&#39;t\nequal 1, then throw exception,...if it does equal 1, check to see if\nit doesn&#39;t equal 2, then throw exception,...if 1 equals 2, then\nincrement someParam.]\n&gt; \n&gt; Please let me know if my logic is correct,...or where I have failed.\n&gt; \n&gt; -------------- Original message -------------- \n&gt; Personally, I&#39;d probably write two test methods.\n&gt; \n&gt; But my advice is to try it both ways and then see\n&gt; which one &quot;smells&quot; better.  Does one approach\n&gt; look like\n&gt; \n&gt; ARRANGE\n&gt; ACT\n&gt; ASSERT\n&gt; \n&gt; ARRANGE\n&gt; ACT\n&gt; ASSERT\n&gt; \n&gt; while the other looks more like\n&gt; \n&gt; ARRANGE\n&gt; ACT\n&gt; ASSERT\n&gt; ACT\n&gt; ASSERT\n&gt; \n&gt; ?\n&gt; \n&gt; And if so, which one feels best to you?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Todd.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; &gt; From: junit@yahoogroups.com [mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com] On \n&gt; &gt; Behalf Of xll_ll_ll_ll_ll_llx\n&gt; &gt; Sent: Sunday, September 11, 2005 1:32 PM\n&gt; &gt; To: junit@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; &gt; Subject: [junit] How many aspects a particular test method \n&gt; &gt; should test???\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Hi all,\n&gt; &gt; I am really really new with JUnit. Do excuse me if this \n&gt; &gt; question is too simple that it irritated you. OK so here is \n&gt; &gt; my confusion:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The method I want to test is something like this:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; public void someMethod(int someParam) throws invalidParamException {\n&gt; &gt;   if(someParam!=1||someParam!=2) \n&gt; &gt;         throw invalidParamException\n&gt; &gt;   \n&gt; &gt;   someParam++;\n&gt; &gt; }\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Now this method will test someParam passed to it and if it \n&gt; &gt; gets stuck in the IF statement will throw exception else \n&gt; &gt; update someParam. Now what I wanna know is that the test \n&gt; &gt; method that I write to test a method like this should I be \n&gt; &gt; writing one test method that tests both whether exception is \n&gt; &gt; thrown correctly as well as someParam updated correctly. OR I \n&gt; &gt; should be writing one test method that tests for the \n&gt; &gt; exception and another that tests whether someParam is being \n&gt; &gt; updated appropriately. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Please reply soon.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Thanks.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Nitesh Maan\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ------------------------ Yahoo!
