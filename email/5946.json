I&#39;ve released <br/>\nseveral open source products, none as cool as your :), and I am faced <br/>\nwith the same dilemma.<br/>\n<br/>\nRegards,<br/>\nDavid<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In junit@y..., Mike Clark &lt;mike@c...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; Dave Astels wrote:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;On Wed, 2002-10-02 at 16:25, Michael Silverstein wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;    We have a product called &#39;Enhanced JUnit&#39; (hence my interest <br/>\nin JUnit<br/>\n&gt; &gt;    extensibility issues) that (among other things) will disburse <br/>\nJUnit tests<br/>\n&gt; &gt;    across threads, VMs, and CPUs for concurrent execution.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.silvermark.com/Product/enhancedjunit/\">http://www.silvermark.com/Product/enhancedjunit/</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Not to start a flame war... but why don&#39;t you follow Beck&Gamma&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; &gt;example and give it to the JUnit community as so many others have <br/>\ndone<br/>\n&gt; &gt;with their extensions?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  <br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; It&#39;s not my intent to add kindling, but this brings up a broader <br/>\nissue.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; You may find it interesting that Enhanced JUnit distributes <br/>\nJUnitPerf. <br/>\n&gt;  I sure did when I learned about it... when the product first hit <br/>\nthe <br/>\n&gt; streets.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Now don&#39;t get me wrong, I&#39;m all about free enterprise.  There&#39;s no <br/>\ndoubt <br/>\n&gt; Enhanced JUnit adds its own bells and whistles over and above the <br/>\nopen <br/>\n&gt; source goodies it includes.  Indeed, distributing tests across <br/>\nseparate <br/>\n&gt; VMs is unique.  But Dave&#39;s use of the word &quot;community&quot; above struck <br/>\na <br/>\n&gt; chord with me.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; As a member of this community, and the open source community in <br/>\ngeneral, <br/>\n&gt; it got me to thinking about the licenses I use for the stuff I <br/>\nbuild. <br/>\n&gt;  Anything I craft in the future may just be licensed such that <br/>\n&gt; commercial redistribution rights are only available by writing me. <br/>\n&gt;  Non-commercial redistribution, and its use in the development of <br/>\n&gt; non-commercial products, will be freely granted.  In other words, <br/>\nif I <br/>\n&gt; contribute to this community in good faith, commercial vendors have <br/>\nto <br/>\n&gt; ask before leveraging my wares.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I guess I expected that type of communication would happen <br/>\nnaturally <br/>\n&gt; inside of a community.  It won&#39;t be the first time I&#39;ve been naive, <br/>\nnor <br/>\n&gt; the last.
