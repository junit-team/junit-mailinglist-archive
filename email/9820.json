It does this by adding bytecode to the compiled<br/>\nclass as it is being loaded.  The software that does this is tested using<br/>\nJUnit.  The class that is delivered by the classloader is in fact the main<br/>\n&quot;object&quot; of the test fixture.  This class is related to the Java class,<br/>\nthe file with the .class extension, but it is not the same.  Among other<br/>\nthings, it is much larger :-(<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is a requirement that the instrumented classes be functionally<br/>\nidentical to the original classes.  Many of the unit tests are there to<br/>\nconfirm that this is true.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome of the classes tested are synthesized at run time, so that there is<br/>\nno .java source file at all.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn other words, fixtures can include classes, although they almost always<br/>\nconsist only of objects.  However, in my experience, the classes<br/>\nthat form part of the fixture are wholly distinct from the TestCase<br/>\nclass, although they are created in the setUp() method.<br/>\n<br/>\nMore details, should anyone be interested, on <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://jxcl.sourceforge.net\">http://jxcl.sourceforge.net</a><br/>\n<br/>\n(JXCL is alpha software, with two known bugs and unsophisticated report<br/>\nfacilities.)<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course, someone with a pronounced and perverse sense of humor might<br/>\nwant to have a go at making the TestCase class itself part of the fixture.<br/>\n;-)<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJim Dixon  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jdd@...\">jdd@...</a>   tel +44 117 982 0786  mobile +44 797 373 7881</div>",
