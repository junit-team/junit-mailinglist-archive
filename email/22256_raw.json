Put the other way, how frequent/expensive does this\n&gt; situ=\r\nation need to be before it is worth investing in the better answer?\n\nBased =\r\non personal feedback from promoting JExample the issue of &quot;overwhelming\n ma=\r\nss-failure of tests&quot; seems to be well known. People that confirm it to me\n =\r\nare typically working in large teams and/or maintaining code written by\n ot=\r\nhers. Alas, I can offer anecdotical evidence only.\n\nFurthermore, I often he=\r\nar that developers can (alas) not use JExample since it\n is an *invasive* s=\r\nolution. On the one hand this might just be a polite \n rebuffal to not hurt=\r\n my feelings :) but on the other hand is seems reasonable \n that in large c=\r\norporate projects adding a new external dependency is likely\n to need appro=\r\nval from project management, which again is typically denied for\n below-the=\r\n-radar projects such as JExample. So exactly the kind of projects\n that are=\r\n likely to suffer from overwhelming mass-failure are unable to move\n toward=\r\ns a solution---unless of course it were non-invasive. That is, either\n base=\r\nd on tool support only (using e.g. code coverage to detect dependencies)\n o=\r\nr being shipped as part of the regular JUnit distribution. (But even then,\n=\r\n many corporate projects don&#39;t upgrade to newer versions of JUnit either.)\n=\r\n\nSo my personal conclusion is that if you want adoption by the conservative=\r\n\n Java community you&#39;d better write a non-invasive tool than a framework. A=\r\nll\n in all, as someone that knows both the Smalltalk and the Java community=\r\n I\n cannot avoid noting that Jave is starting to get stuck in the same stat=\r\ne of\n innovation inertia as Smalltalk. As a contrast consider the PHP commu=\r\nnity\n that picked up and integrated the ideas of JExample as soon as they l=\r\nearned of\n our XP paper! Or also, the Ruby community that releases and inte=\r\ngrated novel\n and *awesome* testing frameworks every half year or so. Just =\r\nthink of RSpec,\n Cucumber, et cetera. But then, given that TextMate is your=\r\n upper boundary for\n tools you&#39;ll naturally look for frameworks rather than=\r\n tool support :) \n\n--AA\n\n\n",
