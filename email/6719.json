Indeed, throughout the book he&#39;s building an <br/>\n&gt; application test-first and reaches for a variety of tools along the <br/>\n&gt; way.  <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It only seems like it&#39;s throughout the book :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nOne &quot;Part&quot; of the book is a project being done test first (~ 225<br/>\npages) that uses a lot, though not all, of the tools and techniques<br/>\ndiscussed in the previous parts of the book.<br/>\n<br/>\nI do pull examples from the project to illustrate concepts earlier in<br/>\nthe book, though.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; So it&#39;s really at least two great books in one!<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Hey!  Good line.. now maybe I can justify the ~550 pages!  It really<br/>\ndoes aim to be very comprehensive... apparently with good success.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor the record, I started this project last March and got the final OK<br/>\nwhile at XP2002 (which, if you were there & noticed, was why I was so<br/>\nhappy the last couple days :).  Anyway, a big part of the reason for<br/>\nwriting it was that there wasn&#39;t a comprehensive sourc of information<br/>\navailable... in fact when I started there wasn&#39;t anything on the<br/>\nshelves on TDD, just chapters or sections in various XP books (my own<br/>\nincluded).  At that point I was unaware of Kent&#39;s book-in-progress. <br/>\nBTW, I think my book makes a good followup to Kent&#39;s if you happen to<br/>\nbe working in Java.<br/>\n<br/>\nOnce it&#39;s out and (hopefully) you all read it, I&#39;d really like<br/>\nfeedback... I&#39;m contemplating a followup that continues by looking at<br/>\nother Java technologies (this book just deals with J2SE) such as J2EE<br/>\nand J2ME, maybe Jini.<br/>\n<br/>\nDave<br/>\nDave</div>",
