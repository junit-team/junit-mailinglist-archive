Thinking back to my\n&gt;debugging experience, I think that 90%+ of the time when an assertion fails,\n&gt;a single change gets the whole test running. Can you tell me more about the\n&gt;situation in which you wanted to see multiple assertion failures for a\n&gt;singlde test?\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\nyes, if the assertions did follow though, we&#39;d end up with lots of \nfailures per-test which to me, could well hide or confuse the true \nissue. Fixing the first failing assert tends to fix the others too.  I \nsee this when I have separated multiple asserts into multiple tests of \none assert.\n\nA (contrived) example: when testing a class that uses a RegEx. We could \nhave a single test that fires lots of different values at it to ensure \nthe RegEx used internally is working correctly. or we could have \nmultiple tests that fire individual values.\n\nI&#39;ve used both approaches, tending to go with many single assertion \ntests when lots of values can be tested against it and a single test \nwith many assertions when only a few variances are needed to test it.\n\n\nAndrew\n\n&gt;Take care,\n&gt;\n&gt;Kent Beck\n&gt;Three Rivers Institute\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;-----Original Message-----\n&gt;&gt;From: junit@yahoogroups.com [mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com] On \n&gt;&gt;Behalf Of Andrew McDonagh\n&gt;&gt;Sent: Monday, August 22, 2005 4:13 PM\n&gt;&gt;To: junit@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;&gt;Subject: Re: [junit] Preventing JUnit from stopping on failures.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;raffadub wrote:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;Assuming there is a test function with several assertions; if one\n&gt;&gt;&gt;failes the assertions past it are not executed.

More specifically; is it possible to execute all\n&gt;&gt;&gt;assertions in a test function despite some have failed.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;I attempted using JFunc, but it is slightly incomplete.
