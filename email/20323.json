I&#39;ve a unit test case<br/>\nwhich makes sure my functionality is working as per expected behavior. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe method I followed here is simple, I&#39;ve tried injecting the mock<br/>\nobjects into my code so that my functionality uses the mock objects<br/>\ninstead of actual &#39;Real Time&#39; Connection object. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut after I finished the whole functionality, I realized that it<br/>\ndidn&#39;t work with a &#39;Real Time&#39; Connection object. I figured out the<br/>\nreason is that I never worried about the &#39;Real&#39; connection object when<br/>\nI was unit testing my code. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy question is.. <br/>\n<br/>\n1) Whose responsibility is to initialize this &#39;Real&#39; object in my class ? <br/>\n2) Should my unit tests cover this &#39;Initializing real time objects&#39; as<br/>\nwell ? <br/>\n3) What way I can assure that my &#39;Real&#39; objects are initialized<br/>\nproperly ? <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m totally stuck here. Any suggestion would be of great help to me.. <br/>\n<br/>\nThanks in advance.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSarat</div>",
