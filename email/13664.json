I have to guess which file is likely to contain <br/>\nthe test for which functionality based on arbitrary details like what <br/>\nfixtures it uses. As it is, I know that tests for the Element class can <br/>\nbe found in the ElementTest class, tests for attributes go in the <br/>\nAttribute class, tests for XPath go in the XPathTest class. Not perfect, <br/>\nbut it  makes it a lot easier to find what I&#39;m looking far.<br/>\n<br/>\nA few minutes ago on another mailing list, somebody asked me a question <br/>\nabout a complicated detail in XPath parsing. Basically he proposed <br/>\noptimizing evaluation by using a  &quot;theorem&quot; I knew to be false. I didn&#39;t <br/>\nremember exactly why the theorem was false, but I knew I had a <br/>\ncounterexample in a test case. Sure enough, a quick glance through the <br/>\nXPathTest class revealed the counterexample. Now if I had had to hunt <br/>\nthrough 12 different classes to try to find the right test case, I still <br/>\ncould have done it; but it would have taken a lot longer.<br/>\n<br/>\nTest suites serve double duty as documentation for a program. They serve <br/>\nthis task better if they&#39;re cleanly organized by functionality rather <br/>\nthan by implementation details like which fixtures they do and don&#39;t set up.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nElliotte Rusty Harold  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:elharo@...\">elharo@...</a><br/>\nXML in a Nutshell 3rd Edition Just Published!<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.cafeconleche.org/books/xian3/\">http://www.cafeconleche.org/books/xian3/</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0596007647/cafeaulaitA/ref=nosim\">http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0596007647/cafeaulaitA/ref=nosim</a></div>",
