Are you worried about a thread not starting or\nan object not getting its fair share of processing time? Or are you worried\nabout the object doing what it&#39;s supposed to do when it gets processing\ntime? I suspect the latter. If so, decouple threading policies from the\nobject and ignore threads while testing. System tests will test the\nthreading issues.\n\n\n\nOn 7/25/03 1:37 PM, &quot;pnjack2001&quot; &lt;pnjack2001@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt; Hi all,\n&gt; I read a few posts about how to test mutli threaded applications,\n&gt; however my case is a bit different.\n&gt; I have an application that when started does some work, and then\n&gt; spins off several threads that do some more work on the same object,\n&gt; while the main thread returns to a wait state or process the next\n&gt; incoming request.\n&gt; eg. Main application receives some data, process it, and then creates\n&gt; an object1, creates another thread to work on that object1, and goes\n&gt; back to process the next incoming message.\n&gt; Does anyone know how can I unit test this?\n&gt; \n&gt; Any ideas greatly appreciated\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
