I&#39;ve never seen a\r\n&gt; test-friendly API that wasn&#39;t also caller-friendly.

Not everybody does, though.\r\n\r\nI suspect we would see more of this problem if TDD became popular, but I&#39;l=\r\nl\r\nstop here before you say &quot;speculation&quot; again :-)\r\n\r\n--=20\r\nC=C3=A9dric\r\nhttp://testng.org &lt;http://testng.org&gt;=20\r\n\r\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\r\n\r\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\n\n",
