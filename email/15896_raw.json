If my initial guess as to this bug&#39;s \n&gt; sourc=\r\ne is correct, this will be easily fixed (back to rc1&#39;s\nbehavior, at \n&gt; leas=\r\nt) soon.\n\nOk, that&#39;s good. That will at least allow me to upgrade ;-). It&#39;d=\r\n be\nideal if we could set the classname to the &quot;real&quot; class name.\n\nBtw, on =\r\nthe topic of JUnit3 tool compat: is it possible to make is so\nwe don&#39;t have=\r\n to write:\n\n        public static junit.framework.Test suite()\n        {\n  =\r\n              return new\njunit.framework.JUnit4TestAdapter(HashtableTest.cl=\r\nass);\n        }\n\n*if* we are using the JUnit4 version of the tools. The log=\r\nic could be\nsomething like:\n\nif (I am asked to run a junit3 test on somethi=\r\nng) {\n   if (any methods have the @Test annotation) {\n      use junit4 beha=\r\nvior\n   }\n\n   fallback\n}\n\nIf this was done and the classname was set correc=\r\ntly, I think we could\nsimulate almost full compat (for simple cases) with j=\r\nunit3 based tools.\n\nIf you get both/either of these in cvs, I&#39;d be happy to=\r\n test them out.\n\n&gt; &gt; Stack Trace Filtering\n&gt; &gt; ---------------------\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; The stack trace from junit messages have always been filed with\njunit.*\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; traces. Ant filters these out. However, now there are org.junit things\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; slipping through. Also, tests with a timeout, have many\n&gt; &gt; java.util.co=\r\nncurrent frames in them. Why leave this kind of\nfiltering up\n&gt; &gt; to each to=\r\nol? JUnit should filter out the frames it knows are from it.\n&gt; &gt; This would=\r\n make command line output look nicer. I think NUnit does\nthis.\n&gt; This is tr=\r\nicky.  The JUnit API actually reports the Exception\nobjects to \n&gt; the tools=\r\n, which are then responsible for displaying / parsing stack \n&gt; traces.  I d=\r\non&#39;t know that there&#39;s anything we could do to make \n&gt; pre-JUnit 4 tools au=\r\ntomatically filter the org.junit lines, but we\nmight \n&gt; look at something f=\r\nor the future.\n\nThere&#39;s a setStackTrace in Throwable that looks promising. =\r\nGranted,\nthis is a bit of a hack, but having the org.junit lines in the tes=\r\nt\nresults gets really, really annoying. At the very least we should\nexport =\r\na polished method that takes care of this.\n\n&gt; &gt; @Test(expected=3D) traces\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; -----------------------\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; When you have an expected exception, and=\r\n another one gets thrown, the\n&gt; &gt; error trace doesn&#39;t contain the bad excep=\r\ntion. You only get:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; java.lang.AssertionError: Unexpected exception,=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; expected&lt;java.util.NoSuchElementException&gt; but \n&gt; &gt; was&lt;java.lang.Nul=\r\nlPointerException&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Having the trace of the bad exception would help=\r\n TAs debug student\ncode. \n&gt; That&#39;s a good idea.  We&#39;ll try to have that in =\r\nthe next release.\n\nThanks. This also comes up with timeouts. It&#39;d be really=\r\n cool to have\na stacktrace from where the thread was hung.\n\nOh, and since I=\r\n&#39;m talking to another person from a school with a great\nCS dept ;-), I&#39;m re=\r\nally interested in writing good docs for students\non how to write test suit=\r\nes, especially for data structures (the focus\nof the 15-211 course). I have=\r\n something that I hacked up for our first\nhomework, however, this kind of t=\r\nhing would be great to make into a\ntutorial that could be used by other cla=\r\nsses.\n\n-- Ben\n\n\n\n\n\n",
