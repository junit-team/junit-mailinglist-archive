You \nwould need a\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; way to differentiate methods that need a non-null parameter \n(@NonNull) =\r\nbut\n&gt; &gt; even so, the method is probably going to throw an NPE, so where \nis=\r\n the added\n&gt; &gt; value?\n\n--&gt;Begin MT\nTestUtil can interrogate every method in=\r\n the code base and provide \nsummary data regarding the behavior of those me=\r\nthods in a testing \ncontext.  A person responsible for the overall health o=\r\nf the code \nbase can determine if the behavior(s) are consistent with the \n=\r\napplication development team design patterns.\n\nAs mentioned, methods with u=\r\nnique behavior require special \nhandling.  Mark had the idea of using JavaD=\r\noc to communicate special \nhandling requirements to the TestUtil verifier.\n=\r\n--&gt;End MT\n\n&gt; \n&gt; In our current architecture - we say that a method should e=\r\nither\n&gt; accept Null, an EmptyString, etc. as a valid input or it should \nth=\r\nrow\n&gt; an ArgumentException (AE). So in our world view a NPE indicates a\n&gt; c=\r\noding error inside the API. I like the distinction an AE says that\n&gt; the AP=\r\nI is not being used correctly whereas a NPE says the API is\n&gt; broken.\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\nRon Jefferies thinks this approach is dead wrong and that methods\n&gt; should =\r\njust do the right thing with Null&#39;s etc. I just don&#39;t see \nwhat\n&gt; the right=\r\n thing is most of these cases.\n&gt; \n&gt; So my suggestion was pass in Null, empt=\r\nyString, etc. to methods \n(not\n&gt; restricted to tests). If they either threw=\r\n an AE or didn&#39;t throw\n&gt; anything then they would be deemed to have passed.=\r\n It would \nindicate\n&gt; that the developer had considered what to do with Nul=\r\nl&#39;s et al.\n\n--&gt;Begin MT\nThe notion of Verification Facilitator includes the=\r\n following \ncomment from TestUtil: By Example:\n\n&quot;It is becoming apparent to=\r\n the author the use of Verification \nFacilitators relies heavily on a stron=\r\ng shared understanding and \nconsistent coding practice for a core patterned=\r\n object (DAO, \nBusiness Object, Application Service Object etc.).&quot;\n\nA DAO m=\r\nethod may have a different contract for handling of nulls \nthan a BO or an =\r\nASO.  The Verification Facilitator must \nbe &quot;patterned object&quot; aware - and =\r\nflag contract violations \naccordingly.\n--&gt;End MT\n\n&gt; \n&gt; The hard part is dea=\r\nling with methods that have multiple \nparameters.\n&gt; For any method that has=\r\n more than one object as a parameter, you \nhave\n&gt; to be able to create an i=\r\nnstance of those objects - so that you&#39;re\n&gt; tests only test one parameter a=\r\nt a time.\n\n--&gt;Begin MT\nThe heavy-lifting is completed with the current vers=\r\nion of \nTestUtil.  Multiple parameter (argument) objects are recursively \ni=\r\nnstantiated as required.\n--&gt;End MT\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
