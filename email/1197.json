This would allow <br/>\nthe testing to fall thru the code and the various assertions/check <br/>\nconditions!!<br/>\n<br/>\nBut would love to hear / see whatz the cleanest meanest way of doing <br/>\nthis? <br/>\n<br/>\nI thought of writing a overridden check()  method for every kind of <br/>\nassert() in the api&#39;s<br/>\nthis way we would have to call the check() instead of the assert, <br/>\n<br/>\nthe check method then calls the assert with the same method argument<br/>\n in a  try catch and in the try we set it to true <br/>\nand  in the catch(AssertFailedException ae) we set the flag <br/>\nto &quot;failed/false&quot; whatever..<br/>\n<br/>\nFinally towards the end of the test we could then do a assert on the <br/>\nflag to fail or succeed the whole test??<br/>\n<br/>\nthoughts ideas welcome!!<br/>\n<br/>\nregards<br/>\nkrishna</div>",
