Rainsberger wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt;  &gt;&gt; &gt;    Are you suggesting that groupping test classes per fixture will be\n&gt;  &gt;&gt; &gt; the only supported option in JUnit4?\n&gt;  &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;  &gt;&gt;This has always been how JUnit is designed and intended to be used. That\n&gt;  &gt;&gt;said, many testers and test suites (including myself and my suites, and\n&gt;  &gt;&gt;apparently even some of JUnit&#39;s own suites) tend to gravitate toward one\n&gt;  &gt;&gt;test class per tested class. This is a very common pattern, even if it&#39;s\n&gt;  &gt;&gt;one JUnit wasn&#39;t meant to support and one that causes test suites to\n&gt;  &gt;&gt;take longer to run than they otherwise would.\n&gt;  &gt;&gt;\n&gt;  &gt;&gt;This does make me wonder if maybe JUnit has been cutting the wrong way\n&gt;  &gt;&gt;all these years. Perhaps it should be designed to organize tests by\n&gt;  &gt;&gt;model class rather than fixture. This certainly seems a lot more natural\n&gt;  &gt;&gt;to a lot of developers.\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; When a class has common code in two methods, we usually Extract Method.\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; When a class has sets of methods that operate on two different parts of\n&gt;  &gt; the class&#39; internal state, we usually split the class in two.\n&gt; \n&gt;    This sounds like theological design discussion and this list\n&gt; probably not the best place for this.\n\nAre you offering to help moderate this list?\n\n&gt; In any case I&#39;d say that you can\n&gt; do above, but it is not always necessary that you should do that all\n&gt; the time.\n\nI did write &quot;usually&quot;.\n\n&gt;    For instance, if you look at typical facade pattern, it is quite\n&gt; often that it would change different parts of the internal state but\n&gt; we still need to test it as a single entity. I am pretty sure that\n&gt; facade is not only case for this.\n\nI have to admit that I can&#39;t make the connection between this paragraph \nand the subject of this thread.\n\nMy point is pretty straightforward: we have these refactoring rules we \noften follow and we usually say that we should refactor tests like we \nrefactor production code, so why wouldn&#39;t we apply these refactoring \nrules to tests?\n\n&gt;  &gt; Why wouldn&#39;t we follow those rules with JUnit test case classes? The\n&gt;  &gt; first rule extracts common setup code into setUp() and fixture objects.\n&gt;  &gt; The second splits test case classes that have multiple fixtures into\n&gt;  &gt; separate test case classes. This leads to test case classes organized\n&gt;  &gt; around fixtures.\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; As for one test case per model class, that&#39;s a natural place to start,\n&gt;  &gt; because it&#39;s simple, but once that test case class becomes complex,\n&gt;  &gt; refactor as usual.\n&gt; \n&gt;    That usually would lead to confusion and will require special tools\n&gt; to track down all the test cases for given class.\n\nI have /never/, /ever/ wanted to track down all the tests for a given \nclass. I /have/ wanted to track down all the tests for a given /method/, \nwhich is dirt simple in any decent IDE. (In Eclipse, I hit Ctrl+Shift+G.)\n\n&gt;  &gt; To say that JUnit supports or doesn&#39;t support this way of organizing\n&gt;  &gt; tests sounds odd to me. I don&#39;t organize my tests a certain way; I\n&gt;  &gt; refactor the tests, and that&#39;s where they tend to end up.\n&gt; \n&gt;    By the way, I believe that such freely-organized test cases will be\n&gt; affected a lot when doing massive code refactorings and/or moving\n&gt; things around classses. So, I&#39;d say it is always a tread off and has\n&gt; to be considered in a case by case base.\n\nYou /believe/ this? or it&#39;s your experience? In my /experience/ it just \nisn&#39;t that much of an issue.\n-- \nJ. B.
