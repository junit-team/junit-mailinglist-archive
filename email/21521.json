So I have a chicken egg sort of situation. NB would do the obvious thing, i.e., have tests generated from code, so the above doesn&#39;t make any sense as it implies that the code is generated from the test, which is a cool idea of the IDE could support it.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I have experience using JUnit, so the framework itself isn&#39;t in question, but how to apply this methodology within the IDE format is.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Do I have to simply short-circuit the default process that NB and the JUnit plugin manufacture?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; thanks in advance for any help on this,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Karl<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Yahoo!
