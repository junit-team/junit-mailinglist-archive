    "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1994533281\">I am attempting to automate my EJB testing inside a Sun container.  I <br/>\nhad hoped to use the Cactus plugin to Maven, but the Sun container is <br/>\nnot supported in Cactus.  Only Tomcat, JBoss, Orion, Resin, and <br/>\nWebLogic containers are supported.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Cactus website indicates that other containers can be used by <br/>\nconfiguring Cactus with a generic container.  Does anyone know how to <br/>\nconfigure the generic container to support a Sun server?  <br/>\nSpecifically, the Cactus site states:<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;The next example shows the use of the generic container element for <br/>\nstarting/stopping a custom container. You need to define the two <br/>\ntargets mycontainer.start and mycontainer.stop, so that the container <br/>\nis started up (on port 8080) before the tests are run, and shut down <br/>\nafter the tests completed. How these targets are implemented is <br/>\nhighly dependant on the container. Most likely you&#39;ll need to copy <br/>\nsome files and use the &lt;java&gt; task to invoke a container-provided <br/>\nJava class that can start/stop the container.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nWhich sounds like Greek to me.  Can anyone provide some hints?  I <br/>\nacquired the cookbook, but I think 11.3 skips a few steps that I <br/>\nneed.  I think I&#39;m stuck at the point where to add one pound of <br/>\nground beef, I first have to hunt down and slay a cow.</div>",
