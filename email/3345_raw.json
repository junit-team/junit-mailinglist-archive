Lets say \nTestCaseA\n\n\nI have some other TestCases (none have a single setup like above) \ndefined as well. Lets call it TestCaseB, TestCaseC.\n\n\nI have an AllTest object to test alll of the above. \n\nIt seems that as soon as I add the TestCase with the single setup \nschecme (TestCaseA), to my AllTest, the TestCase.suite() which does \nthe single time setup never gets called and subsequently my TestCaseA \nwith the suite method fails. \n\nAll the other TestCases (TestCaseB, TestCaseC) work alright with the \nAllTest.suite().\n\n\nI don&#39;t underestand the framework well enough to know what is going \non. Is it that the AllTest.suite() is being used instead of any other \nsingle setup suite method of all other testcase?\n\nHow can I have a single setup specific to a TestCase and yet be able \nto run it as part of AllTest?\n\nhel[/\n\n\n\n\n",
