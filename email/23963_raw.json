I have a class which contains multiple methods that I\nwish=\r\n to test. Each test requires it&#39;s own, specific data set. I cannot use\nPara=\r\nmeterized because I must define a constructor, and I cannot have\nmultiple c=\r\nonstructors. I would like to make my job easier by being able to\nsay test t=\r\nhis method with this dataset.\n\nI use Parameterized a lot, and I have absolu=\r\ntely no problem with defining\nthe data in my class, just like it is suggest=\r\ned in the javadoc for\nParameterized.\n\nIf I could use the same data set for =\r\nall of the methods I wished to test,\nthen I could use the current implement=\r\nation of Parameterized. So see my\ncomments inline.\n\n2012/8/29 Anuj &lt;anujkum=\r\nar1516@...&gt;\n\n&gt; **\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; A Side note first: The gist has a comma alo=\r\nng with it, therefore it\n&gt; doesn&#39;t work when clicked. :)\n&gt;\n&gt; Matthew, being=\r\n a JUnit user for so long, personally I would repel at the\n&gt; idea of writin=\r\ng static classes that extend an interface in my test class.\n&gt; Here are my r=\r\neasons:\n&gt;\nYou don&#39;t use Rules? These are effectively the same thing. You ex=\r\ntend a\nclass/interface and reimplement a method. Effectively the same thing=\r\n here.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; 1) It makes the whole process of writing test cases more compli=\r\ncated.\n&gt; Also, the writing test cases is now coupled with writing test data=\r\n. A\n&gt; tester cannot work exclusively on writing test data without concernin=\r\ng\n&gt; himself from the test cases. This leads to coupling. We should allow th=\r\ne\n&gt; user to write test data separately from the test case.\n&gt;\nI can understa=\r\nnd what you&#39;re saying about separation of tests & test data,\nbut that&#39;s not=\r\n what I want to do. I have no problem with the data and tests\nbeing in the =\r\nsame physical file. In fact, I prefer that because I&#39;m doing\nunit testing. =\r\nIn the past, I have defined my test data in another file, but\nthat&#39;s not wh=\r\nat I&#39;m talking about here.\n\n2) We, as developers, get only a fraction of th=\r\ne time to write test cases,\n&gt; and therefore the less time we have to spend =\r\non writing and executing the\n&gt; test cases, the better.\n&gt;\n&gt; 3) There is a pr=\r\noblem of maintenance here. I personally believe that, the\n&gt; less you make a=\r\n user depend on your framework, the better it is. Junit&#39;s\n&gt; @Test is actual=\r\nly a classic example of how easy it is to get up and running\n&gt; without the =\r\nuser thinking about any external dependencies. The user doesn&#39;t\n&gt; have to f=\r\nollow a nice learning curve and know the APIs. That&#39;s where\n&gt; annotations a=\r\nre so powerful.\n&gt;\n\nI don&#39;t understand what you&#39;re trying to say in either o=\r\nf these points.\n\n\n&gt;  4) In your above gist as well(just like the previous o=\r\nne), a user has to\n&gt; provide annotation at the method level, which, as I po=\r\ninted out before, can\n&gt; and ideally should be avoided. The user should be a=\r\nble to say(in terms of\n&gt; writing test cases) something like : &quot;Here is my t=\r\nest data which contains\n&gt; data for each test method I have in my test class=\r\n. Now run all the methods\n&gt; that are Tests and pass the right parameters to=\r\n them.&quot;\n&gt;\nLike I say above, if I could define something at class level, the=\r\nn I\nwouldn&#39;t need to add this functionality to JUnit. Also, in your easytes=\r\nt\nframework, you have annotation which applies at method level, so I don&#39;t\n=\r\nwhat you&#39;re objecting to.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Well, that&#39;s where atleast my money lies and=\r\n that&#39;s what I have tried to\n&gt; capture in EasyTest.\n&gt;\n&gt; Again, it is a phil=\r\nosophical discussion which can have a lot of rights and\n&gt; wrongs. Whenever =\r\nI design any software, my philosophy always is: &quot;Think\n&gt; about what the use=\r\nrs would be required to learn/code about my software, in\n&gt; order to get up =\r\nand running with my system.&quot; The less the user needs to\n&gt; learn and depend =\r\non an external system, the better and faster the\n&gt; development. Obviously, =\r\nthere are situations where certain things cannot be\n&gt; avoided, and then we =\r\nmake informed decisions. :)\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Cheers!\n&gt; Anuj\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In junit@yahoogrou=\r\nps.com, Matthew Farwell &lt;matthew@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; One thing that you can=\r\n&#39;t do is stack runners, so you can&#39;t use Enclosed\n&gt; in\n&gt; &gt; conjunction with=\r\n other runners.

I think this\n&gt; is\n&gt; &gt; an avenue t=\r\no explore anyway.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; My motivation here is to group all my tests for o=\r\nne class together in one\n&gt; &gt; test class, it&#39;s true.

Bit more boilerplate, but\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; never mind.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Using this gist: https://gist.github.com/3471426, and=\r\n imagining that the\n&gt; &gt; names are not fixed, and that the method of running=\r\n isn&#39;t decided (but I\n&gt; &gt; would prefer to use Parameterized).\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Matth=\r\new Farwell.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; 2012/8/28 David Saff &lt;saff@...&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I&#39;m glad th=\r\nis discussion is going on.

If a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; user wants to do two different things, bu=\r\nt have them accessible in the\n&gt; file\n&gt; &gt; &gt; system in one place, the Enclose=\r\nd runner is always available:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; @RunWith(Enclosed.class)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; pu=\r\nblic class FooTest {\n&gt; &gt; &gt; public static class Thing1 { ... }\n&gt; &gt; &gt; public =\r\nstatic class Thing2 { ... }\n&gt; &gt; &gt; }\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; IMHO, classes are how Java =\r\ngroups methods and data that belong\n&gt; together.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I&#39;m reluctant to intr=\r\noduce new ways of grouping (such as annotations on\n&gt; &gt; &gt; methods that conta=\r\nin the names of other methods) if equivalent\n&gt; class-based\n&gt; &gt; &gt; techniques=\r\n will work.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; David Saff\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; On Tue, Aug 28, 2012 a=\r\nt 10:23 AM, Anuj &lt;anujkumar1516@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; **\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Het Matthew,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I think my previous mail got lost as=\r\n I cannot see it being delivered\n&gt; to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the group even after 3 hours.=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; So here is my response once again:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 1) Parameterize=\r\nd runner does not work in a way that I was talking\n&gt; about\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; DataLoad=\r\ner below. It has the drawback that if you provide a single\n&gt; set of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n test data for multiple methods, it will pass all the test data to\n&gt; all th=\r\ne\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; methods. Have a look at this blog post for more clarification of =\r\nthe\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Parameterized Runner and its drawback:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; http://w=\r\nww.kumaranuj.com/2012/08/junits-parameterized-runner-and-data.html\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 2) I feel a new runner would be a better approach although I do not=\r\n\n&gt; know\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; what all feature set will this runner support.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; 3) I feel it is easier and also simpler if we get rid of the whole\n&gt; id=\r\nea\n&gt; &gt; &gt; of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; providing method names. I say this because in real worl=\r\nd scenario,\n&gt; no two\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; test methods will have exactly the same set of=\r\n test data. Thus the\n&gt; name\n&gt; &gt; &gt; of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the method should suffice inst=\r\nead of asking the user to explicitly\n&gt; &gt; &gt; specify\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the method name =\r\nin the annotation. But thats just my approach.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I feel this =\r\nrequires more input from the community.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Cheers!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Anu=\r\nj\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --- In junit@yahoogroups.com, Matthew Farwell &lt;ma=\r\ntthew@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sorry for any misunderstanding, I agree =\r\nthat there are parts which\n&gt; need\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; be clarified.

I was caught up in a lot of other st=\r\nuff.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I saw the proposal for @DataProvider and it looks a good s=\r\ntart,\n&gt; but\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; IMHO\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it might not turn out to be a great on=\r\ne. Here are some reasons\n&gt; why I\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; feel\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; such apprehension=\r\n:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 1)The annotation currently is applied per method,=\r\n which means\n&gt; that if\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; there is a single class providing the in=\r\nput test data for 10 test\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; methods,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the user has to appl=\r\ny the annotation over each test method. This\n&gt; &gt; &gt; seems\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; undesi=\r\nrable as it promotes duplicacy within the test class.\n&gt; Moreover,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; running each test method would mean extra processing, which can\n&gt; be\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; avoided\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; by making the annotation support ElementType.TYPE =\r\nas well. I\n&gt; have a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; similar\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; annotation(@DataLoader)in m=\r\ny test framework, EasyTest that\n&gt; supports\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; such a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; behav=\r\nior.(\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; https://github.com/anujgandharv/easytest/=\r\nblob/master/src/main/java/org/easytest/annotation/DataLoader.java\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; )\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If you have a single set of data whi=\r\nch applies to all of the test\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; methods,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; then you can use t=\r\nhe current implementation of Parameterized. My\n&gt; point\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; was\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; that I wish to have two methods which have separate sets of data,\n&gt; so\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; therefore I have to specify the DataProvider multiple times.\n&gt; Unle=\r\nss of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; course, you&#39;re suggesting that if we specify @DataProvider =\r\nat class\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; level,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it has the same effect as the current Par=\r\nameterized? I wouldn&#39;t\n&gt; object\n&gt; &gt; &gt; to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 2)It is not clear from the discussion which JUnit Runner will=\r\n\n&gt; support\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; this\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; annotation: Parameterized or Theories o=\r\nr there would be a new\n&gt; Runner.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I was planning to mo=\r\ndify Parameterized, but a new runner would be\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; acceptable.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 3)It would be nice if we give some sense of dire=\r\nction to the user\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; regarding the structure of DataProviderClass =\r\nand the method it\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; supports.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; So, something like :\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Class&lt;? extends Provider&gt; dataProviderClass() default\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; EmptyProvider.class;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Again, forcing people to =\r\nuse an interface for the external\n&gt; classes\n&gt; &gt; &gt; was\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; my\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nfirst thought. However, since we&#39;re specifying the name of the\n&gt; method\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; our DataProvider (if dataProviderClass is not specified), w=\r\nhy not\n&gt; be\n&gt; &gt; &gt; able\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to specify it in the dataProviderClass? Th=\r\ne main difference would\n&gt; be\n&gt; &gt; &gt; that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the method would need to =\r\nbe static in our class, whereas in the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; dataProviderClass it could=\r\n be non-static.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 3)I somehow get the feeling(and it coul=\r\nd be simply me and if that\n&gt; is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; case, please ignore m=\r\ne) that the aspect of performing Data Driven\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Testing\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sh=\r\nould be given more time, and proper thought should be put in\n&gt; around\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; its\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; design and the way it will be made available to the end =\r\nusers. I\n&gt; feel\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; we\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; should not rush into developing a fe=\r\nature focusing a single use\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; case/requirement, rather we should =\r\ntry to first gather and\n&gt; understand\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; all\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the aspects of=\r\n Data Driven Testing and then develop that\n&gt; requirement\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; as a\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; whole rather than in pieces.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I&#39;m not=\r\n rushing, that&#39;s why I&#39;m asking the question on the junit\n&gt; &gt; &gt; mailing\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; list :-) However, I think this is a generalization of the current\n&gt; =\r\nusage\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Parameterized, and this would be useful, to me a=\r\nt least.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Matthew.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I would be much more beneficial to the community a=\r\ns a whole.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Anuj\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --- In junit@yahoogroups.com, Matthew Farwell &lt;matthew=\r\n@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hello,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; So=\r\nrry this took so long to get back to you, but I was trying\n&gt; to get\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n my\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; thoughts together.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I don&#39;t be=\r\nlieve that the suggestion below fits in with the\n&gt; current\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; JUnit\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; philospohy, so doesn&#39;t belong in the junit core library.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; Specifically, I\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; don&#39;t think CSV/Excel/XML parsing belongs i=\r\nn JUnit, so I agree\n&gt; with\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; your\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; decision to write it =\r\nas an extension rather than as part of\n&gt; junit\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; core.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; However, I do believe that we can add stuff to JUnit core in\n=\r\n&gt; order\n&gt; &gt; &gt; to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; allow\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; people to do this sort of =\r\nthing more easily, and maybe help you\n&gt; &gt; &gt; with\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; your\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n code as well.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I often have the following probl=\r\nem: I&#39;ve got a class Foo in\n&gt; which\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I&#39;m\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; testing multipl=\r\ne methods (foo#addInts & foo#addStrings). So I\n&gt; &gt; &gt; create\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; single class to test the two. But if either of these methods\n&gt; are=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; better\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; tested using parameterized, then I can&#39;t do i=\r\nt because I have\n&gt; to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; define\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; construc=\r\ntor. So, what I would propose is to have a\n&gt; @DataProvider\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; anno=\r\ntation\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; which specifies a method to call which returns a colle=\r\nction of\n&gt; data\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; for\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; this particular method. The test =\r\nmethod is called for each\n&gt; item in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; list. See htt=\r\nps://gist.github.com/3471426 for a short\n&gt; proposal. I\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; think\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; this would be fairly easy to do.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I also=\r\n think this would be extensible in another framework,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; specifically\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; your case. All you should have to do is extend=\r\n the\n&gt; @DataParameter\n&gt; &gt; &gt; so\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the data comes fr=\r\nom another source.
