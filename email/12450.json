But there&#39;s nothing wrong with manually<br/>\nsetting up your class using the new operator.  The risk is in the<br/>\nduplication (in your tests, are you setting it up exactly as Spring will?).<br/>\nI&#39;d probably start with using new, and if things start to get complex, then<br/>\nfigure out how to use Spring (which isn&#39;t that hard I believe).<br/>\n<br/>\n-Larry <br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Yagiz Erkan [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:yagizerkan@...\">yagizerkan@...</a>] <br/>\nSent: Friday, December 10, 2004 11:50 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [junit] Testing object instantiated by Spring<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHi all,<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m testing a class that Spring creates an instance for me at runtime<br/>\n(and my code is using it through the interface type) therefore I never<br/>\ndo &quot;new MyClass()&quot; in the production code. In the programmer tests,<br/>\nwould you use the same method of creating the concrete class or would<br/>\nyou call new MyClass() to keep it simple?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\n<br/>\n- Yagiz Erkan -<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://yagiz.blogspot.com\">http://yagiz.blogspot.com</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.erkans.com\">http://www.erkans.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\nYahoo!
