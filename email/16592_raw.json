I have a set of nested classes \nand interfaces with a somewhat complex inheritance/implementation \nstructure.  They act of &quot;connection&quot; nodes.  The nodes are &quot;typed&quot; for \nIn and Out, as well as for data, as in In&lt;MyObject&gt;.  I want to make \nsure that an In can only connect to an Out, that only certain methods \ncan be called on an In and not an Out, and that a &lt;MyObject&gt; can only \nconnect to a &lt;? extends MyObject&gt;.  This requires attempting to make a \nbad connection and then asserting that it results in a compile error. \nThe neccessity for making such &quot;compiler error&quot; tests is real given that \nchanges to extension, implementation, and method visibility affect what \nshould and should not compile and therefore must be tested.  In other \nwords, whether the problem is static or dynamic, testing is important.\n\nIdeally, as with any testing, I&#39;d like to be able to incorporate the \n&quot;bad&quot; tests right alongside the &quot;good&quot; tests, rather than sticking the \nbad ones off in some separate file that must be compiled separately. \nNote also that such an approach means that EACH &quot;bad compile&quot; test \nstatement must be put into its own file and invoked with javac to see if \nthe compile failed.\n\nAlso, I&#39;d prefer a general solution as opposed to a specific one.  The \nissue of needing to make compile error (static) tests is a real one, and \nhas been exacerbated with the introduction of 1.5 generics.\n\n--jon\n\njason r tibbetts wrote:\n\n&gt; jonbarril wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt;&gt;Is there any way to &quot;catch&quot; a compile error for failure assertion?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;I have classes whose methods accept specific combinations of generic\n&gt;&gt;parameter types, and I want to test to make sure that the bad\n&gt;&gt;combinations truly generate compile errors.  I have not been able to\n&gt;&gt;figure out an automatic way to test for a compile error as part of my\n&gt;&gt;JUnit test suite.  Currently, I have to manually uncomment the bad\n&gt;&gt;code lines to &quot;test&quot; if they are still bad compiles.  Is there a\n&gt;&gt;better way?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; If I understand your scenario correctly, you&#39;re testing a feature of the \n&gt; 1.5 language. That&#39;s like testing whether the statement &#39;int i = &quot;foo&quot;&#39; \n&gt; will compile. Why must that be tested?\n&gt; \n&gt; That said, I suppose that you could rig up a test that calls \n&gt; java.lang.Runtime.exec(&quot;javac &quot; + filename) on a number of pre-existing \n&gt; *.java files that will trigger the expected compilation error. You&#39;d \n&gt; have to examine the Process object that&#39;s returned by exec(), wait for \n&gt; it to finish, then assert its exit value and/or error and output \n&gt; streams. I wouldn&#39;t want to be the one who writes that test, though.\n\n\n\n\n\n",
