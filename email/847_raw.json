The suite method error has been plaguing me\nas well.  But I don&#39;t think printing directly to stdout or stderr is\nwhat we want.  Something more general would be better.\n\nPerhaps BaseTestRunner should define:\nvoid runFailed(String message, Throwable t)\n{\n  runFailed(message);\n}\n\nThen subclasses can override the new runFailed if they want access to\nthe exception or error that caused the failure.  Obviously, the calls to\nrunFailed() in BaseTestRunner would have to be changed, which is simple.\n\ntextui.TestRunner.runFailed() can then be changed to print the whole\nstack trace, as you&#39;ve suggested.\n\n--Sameer\n\n&gt; I&#39;m not sure if this is the right place to post this suggestion for a \n&gt; future feature of JUnit. I hope so.\n&gt; \n&gt; I think adding the following two lines to the &quot;getTest&quot; method of \n&gt; the &quot;BaseTestRunner&quot; class would save people a lot of debugging time.\n&gt; \n&gt; \t  System.out.println(e.toString());\n&gt; \t  e.printStackTrace();\n&gt; \n&gt; They would go right after the line with &quot;Could not invoke the suite() \n&gt; method&quot;.\n&gt; \n&gt; I made the change to my copy of JUnit and it pointed me right to a \n&gt; classpath problem (after spending at least an hour guessing at what \n&gt; was wrong).\n&gt; \n&gt; However, as soon as the new version of JUnit is available, I&#39;ll lose \n&gt; the change. It&#39;s not hard to redo but I don&#39;t want to forget.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt; Peter\n\n",
