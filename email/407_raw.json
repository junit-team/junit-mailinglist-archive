ActiveTestSuite does\nnot *have* the behavior I was describing--it&#39;s all in the way I was \n*using* it!\n\nHere&#39;s what I was doing (slightly simplified):\n\n    TestSuite ts = new TestSuite(Foo.class);\n    TestSuite ats = new ActiveTestSuite();\n    for (int i = 0; i &lt; numThreads; i++)\n        ats.addTest(ts);\n\nThis had the undesired effect of having multiple threads share the \nsame TestCase instances.  But all I had to do was change to this:\n\n    TestSuite ats = new ActiveTestSuite();\n    for (int i = 0; i &lt; numThreads; i++)\n        ats.addTest(new TestSuite(Foo.class));\n\n(again, simplified)--and it behaves just like I wanted.\n\nOf *course*.  Now that I&#39;ve found the answer, it seems so obvious!\n\nAttention authors: Can these alternate usage examples be added to the \nActiveTestSuite javadocs?\n\nKevin\n\n\n--- In junit@y..., Kevin Bourrillion &lt;kevinb@m...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; I don&#39;t think I understand ActiveTestSuite.\n&gt; \n&gt; The best I can tell, I should be able to run the same suite\n&gt; simultaneously in multiple threads by doing this:\n&gt; \n&gt;     static Test createThreadedTest(Test test, int numThreads) {\n&gt;         TestSuite ats = new ActiveTestSuite();\n&gt;         for (int i = 0; i &lt; numThreads; i++)\n&gt;             ats.addTest(test);\n&gt;         return ats;\n&gt;     }\n&gt; \n&gt; And this does basically that.  But the problem is, all the threads\n&gt; are acting on the same actual TestCase instances.  Meaning that my\n&gt; test case &quot;firmament&quot; becomes pretty much useless--an object I\n&gt; initialize in setUp() might have been mucked with by another thread\n&gt; by the time I use it!\n&gt; \n&gt; ...\n&gt; \n&gt; So, anyone know how ActiveTestSuite was intended to be used?\n&gt; Documentation is very slight.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks!\n&gt; Kevin\n\n\n\n",
