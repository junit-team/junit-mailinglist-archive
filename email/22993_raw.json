I&#39;m not sure that the=\r\n plan is very practical, as I&#39;d really like to start with a recent version =\r\nof JUnit -like 4.8, and I can&#39;t use it with java 1.4.2\n\nWe do have a reason=\r\nable suite of integration tests (which are NOT unit tests), to ensure that =\r\nthe upgrade goes well.\n\nI was considering, rather than writing unit tests f=\r\nor java 1.4.2, and JUnit 3.8 and then potentially rewriting all of them to =\r\nrun under JUnit 4.8 after the upgrade, it would be better to upgrade the JV=\r\nM first, rely on integration tests, and then write unit tests from scratch =\r\nfor JUnit 4.8.\n\nWhat do other people do if they are in a similar situation?=\r\n\n\n\n\n",
