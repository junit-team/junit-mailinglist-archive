They dramatically reduce the time necessary to go<br/>\nfrom &quot;yeah, I&#39;m done&quot; to really deployable. One problem is that this<br/>\ndebugging time is often not carefully accounted for so it seems I&#39;m taking<br/>\nlonger. Once I factor in the productivity I gain from not having all those<br/>\ninterruptions, though, I can see that I&#39;m going faster.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne reason may be that writing the tests is overlapped with a lot of<br/>\nanalysis and design thinking I would have to do anyway. I end up with<br/>\nanalysis, design, and tests in roughly the same time it would have taken me<br/>\nto do the analysis and design without the tests. This only applies when I<br/>\nwrite tests first. Test-first also neatly solves the &quot;we don&#39;t have time to<br/>\nwrite tests now that the code is &#39;done&#39;&quot; problem.<br/>\n<br/>\nSincerely yours,<br/>\n<br/>\nKent Beck<br/>\nThree Rivers Institute<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a>] On <br/>\n&gt; Behalf Of Cédric Beust ? <br/>\n&gt; Sent: Thursday, February 09, 2006 2:53 PM<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: [junit] Is Junit-based testing REALLY possible <br/>\n&gt; for commercial software development ?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Fascinating questions, Frank :-)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; A few thoughts.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;    - Will thorough testing make the project take longer?  Of course it<br/>\n&gt;    will.  Either in time or in programmers.  After all, we <br/>\n&gt; are talking about<br/>\n&gt;    writing more code, so the number of man.months is going to go up as<br/>\n&gt;    well.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;    The way to solve this problem is to include testing in the planning<br/>\n&gt;    and project features and deadlines accordingly, but for <br/>\n&gt; having been there as<br/>\n&gt;    well, I agree that it&#39;s not always possible. </span></blockquote></div>",
