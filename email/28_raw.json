EJB&#39;s are thin. They are really really thin. The EJB is in fact an\ninterface into a &quot;Box&quot;. Each Box owns some tables in the database. Each Box\nhas its private DB package (we do bean-managed), its own EJB (that acts ass\nan interface into the box), and one or more so-called Business Logic\npackages. These BL packages do all the work. The BL code is Unit Tested in a\nvery detailed way. The only thing the EJBs do is communicate with other\nEJB&#39;s and then call the BL code with the retrieved data.\n\n2. We also test the EJBs, but only very roughly. Every remote method is\ncalled, just to see that they work. The details are not tested here, because\nthey are covered in the BL Unit Tests.\n\n3. To be able to work quickly (hot deployment with underlying packages is\nnot really possible) we use bipolar EJB creators iso the regular EJB Home\nfor the session EJBs. That is a factory that returns the EJB in the normal\nway (created by the EJB Home) *or* as a simple local object, depending on a\nproperty that can be specified in a config file. While developing, we\nusually run the tests on the local session EJBs. Very nice for debugging\ntoo.\n\n4. Only when development of the EJB function is finished, we run the tests\non the remote EJB.\n\nbye,\nvp\n\n\n&gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; From: Vincent Massol [mailto:vmassol@...]\n&gt; Sent: donderdag 16 november 2000 22:23\n&gt; To: junit@egroups.com\n&gt; Subject: Re: [junit] Re: J2EEUnit\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi Jonathan,\n&gt;\n&gt; With the current J22EUnit, it is already possible to unit test\n&gt; EJBs. In your\n&gt; testXXX() method just do a lookup on the home, create the bean\n&gt; and call it&#39;s\n&gt; remote methods. I am still wondering what I could add to make EJB testing\n&gt; attractive and useful :\n&gt; - I could first hide calling an EJB remote method by automatically setting\n&gt; JNDI, doing the lookup, create the bean instance and calling the remote\n&gt; method,\n&gt; - What could I do more ?\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks and please feel free to contribute.\n&gt; Vincent\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n",
