Of course I can\n&gt;put a main() in MyTestSuite with code similar to *Runner.run(new\n&gt;MyTestSuite()) and that will work! I started looking through the source code\n&gt;of the TextRunner to try to work it out but decided it wasn&#39;t important\n&gt;enough to me at the time. So that&#39;s an exaple of where documentation would\n&gt;have helped.\n&gt;\nActually, I think this is exaclty how it works.  What did you get when \nyou tried this?  \n\n&gt;\n&gt;Toby\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\n-- \nDisclaimer:  I join all the news groups out of my own interest.
