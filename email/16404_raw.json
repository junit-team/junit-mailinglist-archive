(The mock won&#39;t invoke itself any more than that.)\n\nAs for a method invoking itself, there&#39;s no direct way to mock the \ninvocation. Some basic reasoning should make that clear: if the method \nis mocked, then it wouldn&#39;t invoke itself. :)\n\nI have thought about this in the abstract before, and don&#39;t have an \nanswer, except to point out that I&#39;ve never wanted to do this. There \nmust be a reason for that, and I hope it&#39;s a good one. :)\n\nCan you tell us what this method does? Perhaps that will shed some light \non what to do.\n-- \nJ. B.
