If you&#39;re building the<br/>\n&gt; suite yourself, you should be able to put an @After on the suite class in<br/>\n&gt; which you can clean up.<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; The philosophy in JUnit has always been for tests to be self-contained, each<br/>\n&gt; leaving the world exactly as they found it. Such tests are more valuable and<br/>\n&gt; less expensive than tests with hysteresis. On the other hand, it can be a<br/>\n&gt; challenge to figure out how to design the system so that such tests are<br/>\n&gt; possible or provide sufficient confidence.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I know. But my canonical Example is Tests that need a database. I know<br/>\nthat testing with a database is not the best idea, but some tests<br/>\nobviously need it. I could open a connection for every testclass in<br/>\n@BeforeClass and close it in @AfterClass. But I don&#39;t see a problem with<br/>\nreusing the connection for several testclasses. But I do want to clean<br/>\nup at the end.<br/>\nI don&#39;t use TestSuites and I would like the feature to work regardless<br/>\nof whether I run the tests solo or in groups or all my tests together.<br/>\n<br/>\nGreetings,<br/>\n   Malte</div>",
