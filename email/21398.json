I&#39;m really impressed with seriousness you approached to<br/>\n&gt; acceptance testing.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; On the other hand it seems that much work was involved to make this<br/>\n&gt; acceptance framework work fine.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Well, I should say that the application sends one HTML file after<br/>\nlogging in and the rest is JavaScript working with the DOM - it&#39;s a RIA.<br/>\nIt&#39;s a first for me, a first for the client.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve spent 40 hours to get the test agent and test conductor to work<br/>\nproperly. That&#39;s for the infrastructure and it&#39;s been running for 12<br/>\nmonths with one hickup regarding XML-RPC (had to change the http client<br/>\nfrom Sun&#39;s to some Apache variant). I don&#39;t think that&#39;s very much,<br/>\nconsidering the alternatives that were available by then.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe bash script that deploys/undeploys have had some love as well, since<br/>\nit pulls things off a maven repo (archiva) looking at metadata to get<br/>\nwhat&#39;s latest, ~8 hours.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I would like to make our Selenium tests work automatically from CI<br/>\n&gt; server (linux server without X), as any JUnit test would work. This<br/>\n&gt; way our Product Owner (yes, we&#39;re Scrumming) could write all necessary<br/>\n&gt; acceptance tests instead of descriptive acceptance criteria.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;d like to see that too, running browsers headless. :)<br/>\n(The test agents we use are setup on a VMware cluster, so the CI server<br/>\nnever launches anything requiring a GUI.)<br/>\n<br/>\nHTMLUnit&#39;s becoming more and more competent regarding JavaScript<br/>\n(framework) support. Crosscheck is interesting as well. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; CI is executing &quot;mvn clean install&quot; periodically and it would be great<br/>\n&gt; if we could automate this process.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Any ideas?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Not really. The Selenium tests takes ~4 minutes to run. A full build<br/>\n(compile, unit test, integration tests) takes about 5 minutes. We want<br/>\nshort feedback cycles and found it to be a good thing to separate the<br/>\nselenium test run since it takes a lot of time with little feedback<br/>\nwhile it runs (no early failure here).<br/>\n<br/>\n/ Fredrik<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",
