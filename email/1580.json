It looks very nice,<br/>\nand is well architected. I haven&#39;t seen anybody talk about it, so I&#39;ll<br/>\nprovide the links. <br/>\n<br/>\nSee the page: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://junit.netbeans.org/JUnit_installation.html\">http://junit.netbeans.org/JUnit_installation.html</a> and look for<br/>\nthe &quot;extensions&quot; link, which is in the section labeled &quot;Dependencies&quot;. The<br/>\nlink is <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://junit.netbeans.org/download/junit-file-diff.zip\">http://junit.netbeans.org/download/junit-file-diff.zip</a> - My browser<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t seem to like retrieving this file directly from the zip file link. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHas anyone had any experience with using this? Are there any other<br/>\nextensions like this floating around? <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBill Laird</div>",
