Then someone was talking about using the\nassertNotNull (and the other methods in Assert) to &quot;guard for the\nunanticipated&quot;. But the way I see it, using assertNotNull() or\nassertNotEqual() or the like means that you actually HAVE ANTICIPATED that\nsomething might go wrong here. And then I&#39;d prefer throwing a checked\nexception instead. There&#39;s nothing you can do with the Assert class that you\ncannot do in normal code lines too. So, if you think some assertThisOrThat\nmay guard against the unexpected, well, don&#39;t you think you could have\nwritten some if-statements as well, throwing some more saying exceptions\nthan AssertionFailedException? It sounds to me that the Assert class is used\nmerely because of &quot;convenience&quot;. But, as I said, I don&#39;t really see any\ndifference except whether you catch your own exception or an\nAssertionFailedException.\n\nJakob Jenkov\n\n\n",
