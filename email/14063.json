If those &quot;whims&quot;<br/>\nare an expression of good design, then you *should* be prepared to<br/>\nmodify production code to fit it into the framework. In the OPs<br/>\ncase, they don&#39;t *have* to change their production code to fit into<br/>\nJUnit; they just have to ensure that each test runs through all the<br/>\nappropriate state-dependencies. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; (note that this claim is different from &quot;write your<br/>\n&gt; production code to make it as easy to test as possible&quot;).<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Another claim is &quot;using a test framework may reveal design<br/>\nissues in your production code that you may want to fix.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nChris &quot;electric hedgehog&quot; Dollin<br/>\nIt&#39;s called *extreme* programming, not *stupid* programming.</div>",
