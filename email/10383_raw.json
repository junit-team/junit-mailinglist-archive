Her\n&gt; argument was that unit tests, as performed today, are able to check\n&gt; only a specific path on the code, the path stablished by initial\n&gt; conditions. Instead, she performed specificacion checking using\n&gt; theorem provers and other advanced tools. This has made me think\n&gt; about the utility of unit testing and the level of code reliability\n&gt; that unit testing can provide.\n&gt; \n&gt; What do you have to say about this? Could it have an impact on unit\n&gt; testing and, specifically, on JUnit?\n\nI have a simple observation to make on this topic.\n\nI have seen unit testing work on many kinds of problems. I have never \nseen theorem provers work on anything except trivial problems on which I \ndon&#39;t need theorem provers.\n-- \nJ. B.
