I would like to use it for 100% but \nI consistently find automated testing of certain types of functionality \nparticular difficult to accomplish.  My work is in digital mapping, and I \nfind complex operations on large data sets problematic.\n\nLet me give a specific example:\n\nI am currently implementing functionality to warp satellite images from one \nmapping projection to another.  The image is distorted according to a \ncomplex formula.  On a low level, I can test that for a given input my \nimplementation of the formula provides the result I expect, but on a higher \nlevel I haven&#39;t been able to automate verification of that the final image \nis correct.  I have only been able to superimpose the result on a \nbackground map I know is correct and eyeball the results.\n\nI would be curious to hear feedback from more experienced JUnit users on \napproaches to testing this type necessarily complex behavior.   I know that \nMock Objects are used to simplify the testing of certain types of otherwise \nproblematic scenarios, but I have no first hand experience with them and \ndon&#39;t clearly see their applicability in a case like this.  Have others \nfound that there are certain areas where, in practice, they simply don&#39;t \napply JUnit as the ratio of effort to develop the test compared to benefit \ngained by the test is too high (certainly the issue of testing GUIs has \nreceived plenty of attention on this list)?\n\nI dislike leaving gaps in my tests, particularly in coverage for the most \ndifficult functionality, as these are the areas most likely to contain bugs.\n\n\nDavid Olivier\nNaval Research Laboratory\nDigital Mapping, Charting & Geodesy Analysis Program\nCode 7440.2\n\n\n",
