I actually did have\n\nan equals() method in SimpleMsg,  but when I looked more closely, I realised\nthat\nthe argument should have been of type Object rather than of type &#39;SimpleMsg&#39;.\n\nSo I guess this means that I do have to write equals() methods then if I want to\nuse\nassertEquals().\n\nThanks again,\n\nregards,\n\nJames\n\n\nJim Cheesman wrote:\n\n&gt; At 11:16 AM 4/30/2001, you wrote:\n&gt; &gt;Sorry to have to reveal my ignorance about what must be a fundamentall\n&gt; &gt;aspect of Java programming, but I cannot understand the TestCase method,\n&gt; &gt;assertEquals(String message, Object expected, Object actual).\n&gt;\n&gt; I think you need to override Object.equals() to be able to use this method\n&gt; correctly: according to the api, the implementation of equals() in Object\n&gt; is such that the references are the same, i.e o1 == o2. This is obviously\n&gt; not the case in the example you give below.\n&gt;\n&gt; (Of course, I could be wrong here....)\n&gt;\n&gt; Jim\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;Below is some code which compares two objects, that I would have\n&gt; &gt;considered to have been equal, and the output from that code:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;--------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt;   SimpleMsg sm1 = new SimpleMsg(&quot;BronwynBishop&quot;, &quot;AddamsFamilyValues&quot;, 53,\n&gt; &gt;42,\n&gt; &gt;                   MultipiMsg.BID_REQUEST);\n&gt; &gt;   SimpleMsg sm2 = new SimpleMsg(&quot;BronwynBishop&quot;, &quot;AddamsFamilyValues&quot;, 53,\n&gt; &gt;42,\n&gt; &gt;                   MultipiMsg.BID_REQUEST);\n&gt; &gt;   assertEquals(&quot;Not Equal&quot;, sm1, sm2);\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;me:~/multipi:au.edu.usq.sci.multipi.TestSimpleMsg\n&gt; &gt;.F\n&gt; &gt;Time: 0.061\n&gt; &gt;There was 1 failure:\n&gt; &gt;1) testAllMethods(org.multipi.TestSimpleMsg) &quot;Not Equal\n&gt; &gt;expected:&lt;BronwynBishopAddamsFamilyValues534216&gt; but\n&gt; &gt;was:&lt;BronwynBishopAddamsFamilyValues534216&gt;&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;FAILURES!!!\n&gt; &gt;Tests run: 1,  Failures: 1,  Errors: 0\n&gt; &gt;-------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;I realise that this may possibly have something to do with differnces in the\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;underlying pointers,  however, if this is the case, then what is the\n&gt; &gt;difference\n&gt; &gt;between the assertEquals() method and the  assertSame() method?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Also, is there any easy way to make comparisons between two such objects,\n&gt; &gt;the contents\n&gt; &gt;of which are totally identical, as I was attempting  to do?  ... or is it\n&gt; &gt;necessary for me to either\n&gt; &gt;either write an equals() method,  or to compare each pair of  fields\n&gt; &gt;separately?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;TIA\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n&lt;snip&gt;\n\n\n--\nJames Sinnamon  sinnamon@...\n\nph 07 46315566,  0412 319669\nPO Box 517 Darling Heights QLD 4350\n\n\n\n\n",
