I was going through the logging\nmechanism and it is found that JUnit does not provide much for logging the\nresults in a separate file so that it can be used in the future. For that we\nhave to use other things like u told ANT. I searched the net in this case\nand there I found the following comments at one of the site\n(http://www.openfuture.de/Log4Unit/)\n\n&quot;Log4Unit is a JUnit extension combining JUnit with Log4J. The intention is\nto create test protocols for JUnit. \n\nJUnit is asymmetrical in the sense that it focusses on the documentation of\ntest failures and errors. Successful execution of a test case is not further\ndocumented. In order to obtain a test protocol that documents the initial\nsettings, the test case execution and its results, a logging component is\nrequired. Log4J as the current de facto standard is selected for this\nextension. \n\nThe current version is 0.1.2 is available for download as\nlog4unit-0.1.2.tar.gz and log4unit-0.1.2.zip.&quot;\n\nHas anyone tried the things or knows anything more about logging the results\nor will I have to use ANT only.\n\nRegards\nVipul\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: ravi_chaddha [mailto:ravi_chaddha@...]\nSent: Thursday, April 03, 2003 8:30 AM\nTo: junit@yahoogroups.com\nSubject: Re: Re: [junit] JUnit Result Logging\n\n\nYou have &lt;Junit&gt; tag to call Junit test cases from Ant and you can\naggregate your reports into HTML etc by using &lt;JUnitReport&gt;\n\n\nGood Luck,\n\n\nRavi Chaddha\n\n\nEngineer QA\n\n\nSNS Technologies  Pvt.
