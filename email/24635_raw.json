This would allow CI server builds to push to a common\nlocation (from multiple operating systems), which could also capture\ndeveloper builds.\n\nYou may want to take a look at tests4j.adligo.org (after it is on GitHub)\nbefore dumping a lot of time into development, since this has been the\nfocus of most of my effort for the entire year of 2014.  Also I thought I\nshould just throw out all of these ideas, as it may provide some food for\nthought if the junit community is anxious to dive in to a new round of\njunit.\n\nCheers,\nScott\n\nPS here
