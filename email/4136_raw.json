How\n&gt; &gt; often do you look at old\n&gt; &gt; code or someone else&#39;s code and wonder now why did\n&gt; &gt; I/they do it that way?\n&gt; &gt; This becomes very handy during refactoring efforts\n&gt; &gt; where it is easy to\n&gt; &gt; forget that a chunk code is there for a specific\n&gt; &gt; reason that should be\n&gt; &gt; accounted for.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ....which should be obvious from the tests. ;)\n&gt; \n&gt; -Eric\n&gt; \n&gt; __________________________________________________\n&gt; Do You Yahoo!?\n&gt; Yahoo!
