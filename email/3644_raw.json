I could have sworn that the\nidentifier you need was actually documented somewhere or stored in a\nstatic variable, but I cannot for the life of me find it right now.\n\nOn Wed, 26 Dec 2001, lchalupa wrote:\n\n&gt; New to Junit.\n&gt; Please give advice on my approach to testing a gui.\n&gt; In the gui, my target method displays an instance of jOptionPane class\n&gt; to confirm a selection the user has just made. In my junit test\n&gt; method, I want to be able to select and close the button on\n&gt; jOptionPane after it has been displayed.\n&gt;\n&gt; I am not sure how to do this. I have done this on dialogs that I have\n&gt; created myself by looking up the button and using doClick().  Seems to\n&gt; work just fine.\n&gt;\n&gt; So, do I use the same approach on jOptionPane? I assume I would look\n&gt; up the identifier of the button in the source and refer to it in the\n&gt; test method?  Or am I missing a more direct approach to the problem?\n&gt;\n&gt; In short, I am not sure how to test a jOption Pane using Junit.\n&gt;\n&gt; Am I on the right track?\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; lee\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
