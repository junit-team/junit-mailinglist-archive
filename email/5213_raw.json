If the expected exception is not\n&gt; raised, then a failure is produced.  \n\nsimplifying (the ctor that takes an int kind of misdirects):\n\npublic void testExceptionExpected() {\n  try {\n    new ArrayList().get( 23 );\n    fail( &quot;Should have thrown IndexOutOfBoundsException&quot; );\n  }\n  catch ( IndexOutOfBoundsException success ) {\n  }\n}\n\n&gt; Errors are unanticipated problems resulting in uncaught exceptions\n&gt; being propagated from a test method.  In the following example, the\n&gt; IndexOutOfBoundsException is not expected. The JUnit framework\n&gt; produces an error if the IndexOutOfBoundsException, or any other\n&gt; unchecked exception, is raised.  \n\nhow about changing the example so that IndexOutOfBoundsException\nshouldn&#39;t be thrown.  plus, IndexOutOfBoundsException is an unchecked\nexception, so don&#39;t bother with adding it to the throws clause:\n\n  public void testExceptionUnexpected() {\n    List list = new ArrayList();\n    list.add( &quot;blah&quot; );\n    assertEquals( &quot;0th element&quot;, &quot;blah&quot;, list.get( 0 ) );\n  }\n\n&gt; Both failures and errors will cause the test to fail.  However, it\n&gt; is useful to differentiate between failures and errors because the\n&gt; debugging process is slightly different.  \n&gt; \n&gt; In the first example, the use of fail() will not generate a\n&gt; complete stack trace including the method that raised the\n&gt; exception.  In this case that&#39;s sufficient since we anticipate that\n&gt; the exception will be raised.  If it&#39;s not raised, then it&#39;s a\n&gt; problem with the test itself.  \n&gt; \n&gt; In the second example,  the JUnit framework catches the exception\n&gt; and generates an error with a complete stack trace for the\n&gt; exception.  Since we don&#39;t expect this exception to be raised, a\n&gt; complete stack trace is useful in debugging why it was raised.\n\ngolden.\n\ni was struggling with whether checked exceptions advertised in the\n&quot;throws&quot; clause of a method being tested represented &quot;anticipated&quot;\nfaults that merited catching and failing the test if caught.\nafter reading all the discussion here and at the wiki, i&#39;m inclined\nonly to catch the exception that should be thrown during the course\nof a test (if any), letting the others propagate out as errors.\n\nif that&#39;s the majority opinion of the user community, then i&#39;d go so\nfar as to mention it in the FAQ...that this leads to test methods\nthat themselves advertise &quot;throws Exception&quot;, allowing checked\nexceptions which aren&#39;t anticipated in a given test to be treated as\nerrors rather than failures, resulting in cleaner code:\n\n  public void testReflectiveInstantiation() throws Exception {\n    MyClass instance = (MyClass) MyClass.class.newInstance();\n    assertNotNull( instance );\n  }\n\nversus:\n\n  public void testReflectiveInstantiation() {\n    try {\n      MyClass instance = (MyClass) MyClass.class.newInstance();\n      assertNotNull( instance );\n    }\n    catch ( IllegalAccessException ex ) {\n      fail( &quot;threw: &quot; + ex );\n    }\n    catch ( InvocationTargetException ex ) {\n      fail( &quot;ctor threw: &quot; + ex.getTargetException() );\n    }\n    catch ( ExceptionInInitializerError error ) {\n      fail( &quot;threw: &quot; + error );\n    }\n    catch ( SecurityException ex ) {\n      fail( &quot;threw: &quot; + ex );\n    }\n  }\n\nthanks for the enlightenment!\n\n--p\n\n\n\n",
