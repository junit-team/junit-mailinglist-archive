But since we&#39;re already in this territory\n\n\nI&#39;m not sure=\r\n we moved away from the original topic.\n\nThe original poster was basically =\r\nasking &quot;I don&#39;t like writing tests, I\ndon&#39;t always to test driven design, i=\r\ns it bad?&quot;.\n\nThe traditional answer to this question on this mailing-list i=\r\ns &quot;Yes&quot; and &quot;I\ndo 100% TDD and it works great, what&#39;s wrong with you?&quot;.\n\nMy=\r\n experience differs.\n\nI don&#39;t always do TDD and I claim that very few peopl=\r\ne do.\n\nIt doesn&#39;t mean that their software is worthless or that they are ba=\r\nd\ndevelopers.  As you very insightfully point out, the taste for testing is=\r\n\nvery personal.  Some people love it.  Some people hate it.  Most people\ndo=\r\nn&#39;t feel very strongly either way, but they do have customers, deadlines\nan=\r\nd inflexible bosses to respond to.  And I think it&#39;s our duty to listen to\n=\r\nthem and help them out.\n\nI&#39;ll just repeat what I said in my previous email:=\r\n  most of the software out\nthere is 1) not tested and 2) works great.\n\nI&#39;d =\r\nlike everybody to reflect on that for a while before I send my next\nmessage=\r\n...\n\n-- \nC=E9dric\nhttp://testng.org\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message ha=\r\nve been removed]\n\n\n",
