Thanks,\n&gt;\n&gt; David Saff\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; novotique wrot=\r\ne:\n&gt; &gt; Hello all,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Firstly, I want to say that this is a fantastic f=\r\norum! I have been\n&gt; &gt; using it for only one year now but in that short spac=\r\ne of time you\n&gt; &gt; have all helped me not only to write better tests but to =\r\nalso be a\n&gt; &gt; better developer.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Now to my problem :-) I searched fo=\r\nr a solution to this but all in\n&gt; &gt; vain. Essentially I want to execute a J=\r\nUNIT test on a unix box\n&gt; &gt; remotely while connecting to the JVM using ecli=\r\npse on my windows\n&gt; &gt; machine with the intention of debugging.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; How =\r\ndo I launch my JUNIT with a debug option on the command line? I\n&gt; &gt; don&#39;t w=\r\nant to use ANT. The problem I have is that we develop on\n&gt; &gt; windows but th=\r\ne application is designed to run solely on some\n&gt; &gt; different flavours of u=\r\nnix (mostly HP-UX).\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; All our tests run automatically at night after =\r\nthe daily build but\n&gt; &gt; sometimes the tests will fail on unix and pass on w=\r\nindows. Ideally,\n&gt; &gt; the solution would be to develop and test on unix but =\r\nthis is not\n&gt; &gt; permitted due certain limitations beyond my control.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; Any help would be very much appreciated.\n&gt; &gt; regards,\n&gt; &gt; David.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Yahoo!
