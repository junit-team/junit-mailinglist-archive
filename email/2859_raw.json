I&#39;m working on an\n&gt; &gt;     &gt;&gt; application, and I&#39;d like to avoid reinventing the wheel if\n&gt; &gt;     &gt;&gt; possible :)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;     Robert&gt; The lack of reflection makes it hard for a true port. I&#39;ve\n&gt; &gt;     Robert&gt; seen a couple of JUnit-like test tools that just didn&#39;t\n&gt; &gt;     Robert&gt; motivate me enough to use them. We use JUnit on a desktop\n&gt; &gt;     Robert&gt; for our unit tests and then verify we can build with\n&gt; &gt;     Robert&gt; bootclasspath set for a MIDP environment. That covers\n&gt; &gt;     Robert&gt; everything except the UI.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I found the same thing that you did. We tried to run it as is, then we\n&gt; &gt; tried to take bits and pieces of it as they existed, and we ran into\n&gt; &gt; NoSuchClass errors everywhere :) And they mostly dealt with reflection\n&gt; &gt; stuff.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The ability to write our code according to JUnit and J2SE and then\n&gt; &gt; just build as you said would be great. I&#39;m just a novice at this J2ME\n&gt; &gt; MIDP stuff, but my pair partner is pretty experienced. He seems to\n&gt; &gt; believe that we&#39;ll have a problem following a model like this for the\n&gt; &gt; connection and socket stuff, since the API is different.
