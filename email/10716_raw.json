It uses an inner class. Works great ...\n&gt; \n&gt; I have never recommended using inner classes for this kind of \n&gt; thing. I find it unnecessarily complicated.\n\nHmmm, I found what I thought was your reply to someone while searching the\narhive for &quot;Parameterized Test Case&quot;, but I did not go far enough. I guess\nthe stuff you were referring to starts around:\nhttp://groups.yahoo.com/group/junit/message/9954 \n\nI did notice that the setup and teardown were not called before and after\nthe inner tests were run :(\n\nLooking forward to reading about the ptc.\n\nThanks for contibuting your work on the subject.\n\n\n\n",
