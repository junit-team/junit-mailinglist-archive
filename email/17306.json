Would you bet<br/>\nagainst me?<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you HAVE tested the code then you know that it passes your tests.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nRight, it passes my tests.  It doesn&#39;t mean that it works.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust like having 100% coverage doesn&#39;t mean that my code works.<br/>\n<br/>\nDeveloper tests are biased, they only cover a part of the story.  Customer<br/>\nusage is, of course, biased as well, but it&#39;s a yardstick that&#39;s just as<br/>\nvalid.<br/>\n<br/>\n The only way to do that is to write tests,<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYes. Well, that&#39;s one way to prove it, there are more.<br/>\n<br/>\nand to write them *before* you write the code.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nNo.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy is test written first better than test written after?<br/>\n<br/>\nWriting tests after the fact is far<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; less effective because the code was almost certainly not written to<br/>\n&gt; be testable.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Why?  If someone like you write the code, you&#39;re going to design it to be<br/>\ntestable, aren&#39;t you?  You will be using well-known principles such as<br/>\ninterfaces, dependency injection, avoiding statics, methods with too many<br/>\nparameters, decoupling your classes, etc...<br/>\n<br/>\nIt can be argued that writing test firsts can be detrimental to your<br/>\nvelocity because it introduces churn:  you don&#39;t know yet what your final<br/>\ncode will look like, and before you reach something you&#39;re comfortable with,<br/>\nyou might have to rewrite it two or three times.  And every time, you will<br/>\nhave to modify these tests as well.  TDD can be a big waste of time.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere is why.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith test first, you have something like:  Test v1, Code v1, Test v2, Code<br/>\nv2, Test v3, Code v3.  Check in.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you postpone your testing a bit, you have:  Code v1, Code v2, Code v3,<br/>\nTest v3, Commit.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe latter approach will get you to your goal much faster.<br/>\n<br/>\nAgain, I&#39;m not saying that TDD is bad, just that it comes at a price and<br/>\nthat this price needs to be evaluated before *every* single project or task<br/>\nthat you undertake.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nCédric<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://testng.org\">http://testng.org</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",
