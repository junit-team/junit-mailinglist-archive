My apologies in advance if this has been hashed out<br/>\nbefore.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; While generally thinking that its not a great idea, I occasionally<br/>\n&gt; come into a situation where I genuinely need to partition my tests<br/>\n&gt; into more than one group or partition or suite.  The latest example is<br/>\n&gt; with a client who has many unit style tests as well as a number of<br/>\n&gt; tests which require specific network connectivity only available from<br/>\n&gt; a subset of machines (the outgoing requests must come from a specific<br/>\n&gt; ip address).  We call these the &quot;online tests&quot;.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; We want to be able to group our tests into two groups, &quot;unit tests&quot;<br/>\n&gt; and &quot;online tests&quot;.  In some case we want to run only &quot;unit tests&quot; or<br/>\n&gt; only &quot;online tests&quot;, and in other cases we want to run both (or all).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I understand that this functionality is available using JUnit 4&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; @RunWith(Suite.class) and @SuiteClasses(TestClass1.class, ...). <br/>\n&gt; However, manually adding test classes to a suite is clunky because the<br/>\n&gt; list of  test classes becomes huge.  It&#39;s also error prone; it&#39;s easy<br/>\n&gt; for developers to write a test but forget to add it to @SuiteClass. <br/>\n&gt; Lastly, test runners will run test in suites multiple times when told<br/>\n&gt; to &quot;run all tests&quot;.  That&#39;s hardly the desired behavior.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; What I really would like to see is the concept of suite (or group in<br/>\n&gt; TestNG terms) be promoted to a first class citizen.  Honestly, I think<br/>\n&gt;  I would prefer it to be at the test class level (unlike TestNG which<br/>\n&gt; is at the test method level), since the mechanism should be used for<br/>\n&gt; high-level organization IMHO.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Is there any chance something like this might make its way into JUnit?<br/>\n&gt; What can I do to help?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Thanks,<br/>\n&gt; Christian </span></blockquote></div>",
