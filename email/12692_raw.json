The test thread then waits\n&gt; for the receiving thread to notify it when the packets are received.\n&gt; The test thread then gets the packets from the receiving thread.\n&gt;\n&gt; So I want to only start the receiving thread once per testcase and not\n&gt; once per test. Otherwise  I have multiple receiving threads trying to\n&gt; bind to the same socket. I also have difficulty stopping the receiving\n&gt; thread in tearDown because it is i/o blocked and even if I interrupt\n&gt; it, it does not terminate before the next test starts.\n\nI would try to have a new server per test. Possible solutions to your \nproblem are:\nGet the server to use a dynamic port so multiple servers can coexist.\nReplace the sockets with a non multithreaded direct communication.\nUse Thread.join to wait for the server thread to die.\n\n- Neil Swingler\n\n\n",
