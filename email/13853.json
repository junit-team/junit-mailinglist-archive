I have 3.8.2 right now, and I don&#39;t know whether <br/>\nit&#39;s been released to the public -- the most visible change is better <br/>\nhighlighting of the differences between unequal strings. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nExpected: ab[c]def, but was: ab[dr]def<br/>\n<br/>\nThe difference is in the brackets.<br/>\n<br/>\nOpening the kimono, Kent invited me to be involved in JUnit 3.8.x and <br/>\nJUnit 4.0, then asked me to do some code review for him, and I haven&#39;t <br/>\ndone it, mostly due to low motivation. For this reason I&#39;m not too hard <br/>\non them for keeping things under wraps: if I were really so intent on <br/>\nbeing involved, then I would do what they ask me to do, but since I <br/>\ndidn&#39;t, I don&#39;t complain. :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Failing that, perhaps this group could decide what it really wanted<br/>\n&gt; and then make the changes and release a 3.8.2? I mean, it&#39;s not like<br/>\n&gt; we don&#39;t have some of the finest testing brains on the planet around<br/>\n&gt; here (self _not_ included), not to mention some very strong opinions<br/>\n&gt; (ok, I&#39;m in this category). Just a wild Friday afternoon kind of<br/>\n&gt; thought.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I strongly believe that even some of the best minds in this community <br/>\ndon&#39;t share the core philosophy of maintaining a small, closed <br/>\nframework. For that reason, I&#39;m not too keen on &quot;opening it up&quot;. I don&#39;t <br/>\nreally trust myself with that, except for the fact that I&#39;ve never <br/>\nactually asked for an addition to JUnit. I just think more people need <br/>\nto use the JUnit-addons test runner. That would satisfy quite a few of <br/>\nthem. :)<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJ. B.
