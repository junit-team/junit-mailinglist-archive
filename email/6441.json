A TestCase is the embodiment of a *fixture*... a<br/>\n&gt; specific context in which tests are run.  As such it should contain<br/>\n&gt; only those tests (i.e. test methods) which run in the context of the<br/>\n&gt; fixture that the TestCase embodies.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>  [...]<br/>\n<br/>\nI entirely agree that TestCases are (despite the name) intended to<br/>\nrepresent fixtures, and that mindlessly creating one TestCase per<br/>\nclass under test is a Bad Thing.  Your example in a subsequent<br/>\npost of separate TestCases for a list implementation illustrates<br/>\nthe point quite nicely.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, I think there are cases in which it is sensible to have<br/>\none TestCase for one class.  For example, suppose we have a<br/>\nComparator which sorts Integers lexicographically according to<br/>\ntheir written-out forms in English.  The class has no internal<br/>\nstate; all instances are equivalent.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn such a case, it seems to me not unreasonable to have a series<br/>\nof methods, say, one to test that 8 &lt; 7, one to test that 2 &gt; 3,<br/>\nand so forth, all in the same TestCase.  I can&#39;t think of a set of<br/>\ntests of such a class which merit a separate fixture.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe might take the view that, when a TestCase is closely tied to a<br/>\nsingle class this way, the fixture under test consists simply of<br/>\nthe class itself (rather than an instance with some specific<br/>\nstate).  If there is nothing else in common among the test<br/>\nmethods, it is not unreasonable to leave them all in the same<br/>\nTestCase, rather than, say, putting each in its own TestCase.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nSteven Taschuk           | &quot;Renner was competent.
