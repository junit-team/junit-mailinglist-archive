Sounds like you have your &quot;Designer&quot; hat on. That wasn&#39;t what I\n&gt; understood to be the context of the question. &quot;How do I test a private\n&gt; method&quot; is a question someone wearing their &quot;Tester&quot; hat would ask.\n&gt; Given that context, my mind hasn&#39;t changed. If the private method is\n&gt; already tested through an existing public method then you don&#39;t need\n&gt; to do anything. In fact, exposing the method and writing an explicit\n&gt; test against it is duplication.\n\nIs it really?\n\nFirst: the question &quot;How do I test this private method&quot; is a trigger\nto me to swap out to my Designer hat - it means that there&#39;s an\nabstraction that&#39;s worth taking out.\n\nSecond: if it&#39;s already tested _enough_, then there is no need to test\nit, is there? But I don&#39;t know why I would ask that question if it&#39;s\nalready tested enough.\n\nThirdly: if it&#39;s not tested enough, then exposing the method and\nwriting new tests is not duplication - in fact, it can significantly\nreduce duplication by removing the need to duplicate extraneous setup\nwork.\n\nRobert.\n\n\n\n\n",
