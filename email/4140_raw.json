It seems all the method names should start with\n&gt; &quot;test&quot;. Can the method name be testX, where X can be\n&gt; anything? or X necessarily has to be a method of my \n&gt; class being tested. \n\nYour test method names can be anything you want, but if you name them all \ntest*, then you can let JUnit build each class&#39; test suite for you.\n\n&gt; 2. It is not uncommon that the methods of a class\n&gt; require a &#39;state&#39; in order for them to be called.\n&gt; and coming to this &#39;state&#39; is often not an easy task.\n&gt; Is the method setUp meant for this purpose? But\n&gt; then, different methods require a different setup.\n&gt; What does junit framework suggest on this issue of\n&gt; having setUps and tearDowns for each method?\n\nExcessive setup is a design smell. Your class may be more complex than it needs \nto be.\n\nsetUp() is meant to help you factor out any &quot;setup&quot; code that your tests may \nhave in common. If all your tests have the same first four lines of code, that \ncode can go in setUp().\n\n&gt; 3. I do not really think I have understood what\n&gt; junit is. Is the junit framework a spec? Does this\n&gt; really require a seperate software? I mean, calling\n&gt; a sequence of methods of a class is not that non-\n&gt; trivial. Can somebody explain to me why I should use\n&gt; junit?\n\nUse JUnit; don&#39;t use JUnit. That&#39;s up to you. Let me suggest this, though: if \nyou don&#39;t use JUnit, then you&#39;ll probably start to build test methods and test \nclasses that, if highly refactored, will give rise to something very similar to \nJUnit. If you need convincing, evolve your own test framework. Within months, \nit&#39;ll become eerily similar to JUnit. You can either take my word for it, save \nyourself the effort and use JUnit or roll your own. :)\n\nJ. B.
