However, trying to filter on<br/>\nmore than one method doesn&#39;t seem to be intuitively obvious, and<br/>\nnothing really seems to work.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe code I use to get one test to run is as follows (it&#39;s from the<br/>\ntest class&#39;s main() method):<br/>\n    JUnitCore core = new JUnitCore();<br/>\n    Request testRequest = Request.method(aTestClass, someArguments[0]);<br/>\n    core.run(testRequest);<br/>\n<br/>\nI have no idea how to extend this model to being able to specify<br/>\nmultiple methods, however.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn addition, I really hope that someone starts documenting all of the<br/>\nnifty new features in JUnit 4.x - the current level is somewhat<br/>\n(frustratingly) incomplete. The basic features have been covered by a<br/>\nnumber of writers - the more complex, such as this issue, still seem<br/>\nto be missing.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think JUnit has the potential to become even more popular with a<br/>\nclearer examination of the framework on which it is built. There seems<br/>\nto be a great deal of power and flexibility available - it&#39;s just<br/>\nreally unclear as to how to get at it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks in advance!<br/>\n<br/>\nMichael Schechter<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a>, David Saff &lt;saff@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Shannon,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; You are right--this doesn&#39;t currently work in JUnit 4.1.

I create and run the test like this:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Request r = Request.method(OldStyleTestCase.class, &quot;testSomeMethod&quot;);<br/>\n&gt; &gt; jcore.run(r);<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; The outcome is that all test methods are run, not just the one test<br/>\n&gt; &gt; method I specified. I also tried using a custom filter, but the filter<br/>\n&gt; &gt; never gets called because the runner for this class is<br/>\n&gt; &gt; org.junit.internal.runners.OldTestClassRunner which does not implement<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Filter.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Do I need to write my own runner to get this to work? Is there another<br/>\n&gt; &gt; work around?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Thanks for any help.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; /Shannon </span></blockquote></div>",
