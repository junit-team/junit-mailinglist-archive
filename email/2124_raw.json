Thanks for your well-formed opinions!!!\n\n-Jason\n\n    &gt; -----Original Message-----\n    &gt; From: Thomas Obst [mailto:thomas_obst@...]\n    &gt; Sent: Thursday, July 26, 2001 9:45 AM\n    &gt; To: junit@yahoogroups.com\n    &gt; Subject: Re: [junit] Reporting more then 1 failed \n    &gt; assertion per test\n    &gt; \n    &gt; \n    &gt; Jason Rogers wrote:\n    &gt; \n    &gt; &gt; I respectfully disagree.  You assume that asserts and \n    &gt; test cases are equal\n    &gt; &gt; in their importance.  What I want to know is whether or \n    &gt; not a test has\n    &gt; &gt; passed.  ...  So, why count asserts?  Perhaps to give\n    &gt; &gt; that warm, fuzzy feeling... perhaps for some other reason.\n    &gt; \n    &gt; The only important thing is whether the application \n    &gt; works. Whatever else  we\n    &gt; evaluate, whether it is the number of asserts, the number \n    &gt; of tests, the number\n    &gt; of test cases, or even whether we test at all, is just \n    &gt; there to give us that\n    &gt; &quot;warm, fuzzy feeling&quot; or to give us the shivers. The \n    &gt; number of tests/asserts\n    &gt; doesn&#39;t prove anything but it does give us a hint at an \n    &gt; appropriate body\n    &gt; temperature.\n    &gt; \n    &gt; I guess this whole discussion really boils down to what \n    &gt; constitutes a test. I\n    &gt; choose to organize my tests so that I generally have one \n    &gt; test per tested method,\n    &gt; with appropriately many asserts per test. Other \n    &gt; programmers might want to\n    &gt; refactor my test code so that basically one assert per \n    &gt; test was the rule. This\n    &gt; is probably just a matter of taste. If so, it would be \n    &gt; nice if JUnit would\n    &gt; support both approaches - displaying the number of tests \n    &gt; _and_ the number of\n    &gt; asserts.\n    &gt; \n    &gt; - Tom\n    &gt; \n    &gt; \n    &gt; \n    &gt; ------------------------ Yahoo!
