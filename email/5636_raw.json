Unless the DB is set up, the test will fail. \n\nDifferentiating between completely standalone tests (eg StingUtility \nclasses) or requires a test environment (eg database, file structure) \nwould be terrific, especially with the Ant junit batchtest structure, \nwhere Ant works its way through the code and finds Tester classes to \nrun.  It doesn&#39;t have any way of knowing the environment that it&#39;s \nrunning in, or the environment that the test needs.\n\nFor example:\n\na new method\n\nString getProject() - Returns the name of the project.  Allows for \nsimple &quot;namespaces&quot; for test environments.\n\nString[] getTestEnvironments() - that returns a list of required test \nenvironments (by name).  \n\nUpdated JUnit testrunners that will by default run all tests \nregardless of environment.  New JUnit testrunners that take a list of \navailable projects/test environmnets as parameters, and only run \nthose tests that run in available environments.\n\nAll of which would be upwardly compatible.\n\nAny thoughts?\n\nDavid Ford\n\n\n\n",
