Up until now vi+BASH has been my IDE of\nchoice.  I also already program in about two dozen languages.\nTo try out my sea legs I want to compare and contract Eclipse,\nNetbeans, and IntelliJ IDEA against the following use case:\nI need to grock some java code in an existing SVN repository.  I want\nto pull down one existing java file, write some junit tests, but not\npull down the entire giant project it is attached to.  I may need some\nmoch objects too just to get it to compile, and to make the junit\ntests work.\nMost of the how-to and intro stuff I can find on these IDEs starts\nwith &quot;so you make your FIRST project, then pull down some menus, and\nthe wonderful IDE helps you type in your FIRST java program, then if\nyou really want to you can save the entire project in CVS!&quot;  This is\nhardly EVER the scenario I run into.  It is more likely I need to jump\ninto the middle of thousands or millions of existing files and learn\nto swim without breaking anything, maybe even fix a bug or add a\nfeature.\n\nCan anyone give me some tips on the &quot;best&quot; way to do this with his or\nher favorite IDE and some selection of plugins?\n\nBrian Fennell\n\n",
