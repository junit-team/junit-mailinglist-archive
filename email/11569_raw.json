It usually takes a\n&gt;&gt;&gt; noticeable time to run them all.\n&gt;&gt; Can you quantify this? GSBase, for example, runs tests at\n&gt;&gt; approximately\n&gt;&gt; 100/second, and that&#39;s my usual performance goal for tests. On\n&gt;&gt; my most\n&gt;&gt; recent project, I separated tests that required expensive,\n&gt;&gt; external\n&gt;&gt; resources (there were about 10) from tests than ran entirely in\n&gt;&gt; memory\n&gt;&gt; (there were about 400). The in-memory tests ran in about 6\n&gt;&gt; seconds.\n&gt;\n&gt; I will add that on my last project we had 2000+ /unit/ tests that ran \n&gt; in\n&gt; 20 - 30 seconds.  Our functional tests (over 30) at one point were\n&gt; running in 17 minutes.  With 1.5 days of refactoring the functional\n&gt; tests they ran in 3 - 5 minutes.\n&gt;\n&gt; If you are keeping count that is 2030+ tests within 5 minutes, an\n&gt; average of 406 tests per minute (but let&#39;s not forget that the unit\n&gt; tests ran about 4000 - 6060 per minute).  Those are not shabby numbers,\n&gt; but they aren&#39;t the best either.  There was definite room for\n&gt; improvement, but we found that the ROI was not high enough to bring \n&gt; them\n&gt; down anymore.\n\nThat&#39;s wonderful.  But it&#39;s impossible and likely incorrect to compare \nthose results to any other project in any way other than a purely \nstatistical analysis over many, many projects.  There are far too many \nother variables involved when running the tests.\n\nSome people *have* encountered a lower limit to test execution time, \nfor whatever reasons, and so it&#39;s reasonable to look for ways to \n(automatically or not) order the test execution based on recognized \ndependencies.\n\nAnd while it&#39;s true as JB notes that you might not be able to have a \ntheoretically 100% accurate dependency tracking, a 95% accurate reading \nwould probably be better than running tests too infrequently because \nthey take too long, or spending a lot of time manually munging about \nreconfiguring test suites.\n\n\n",
