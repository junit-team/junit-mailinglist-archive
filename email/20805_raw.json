In \nEclips=\r\ne I right-click on one of these methods and select &quot;Run As Unit \nTest&quot;.  It=\r\n runs both methods, not just the one I clicked on.  This is \nusing the JUni=\r\nt that comes with Eclipse Ganymede out of the box.\n\nIs this how it supposed=\r\n to work?  I was expecting it to run only the \none method on which I right-=\r\nclicked.  Is my expectation incorrect?\n\nI&#39;m working on a custom Runner.  If=\r\n the user does what I did above, I \nsee how the test runner gets notified o=\r\nf the class, but not the name of \nthe method.  I&#39;ve seen some JUnit 4 docs =\r\ntalking about filtering, so I \nthought maybe the JUnit framework would look=\r\n through the Description \nobject returned by the runner and only execute th=\r\ne method which the \nuser right-clicked.  The class JUnit4TestMethodReferenc=\r\ne does save a \nDescription object that contains the method name, but I don&#39;=\r\nt see where \nthat is used.  Am I missing something?\n\n-Sam\n\n\n",
