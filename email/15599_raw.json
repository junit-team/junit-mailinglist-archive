I worked with Kent and \n&gt; Erich on the =\r\nparameterized support, so here&#39;s my utterly \n&gt; non-binding thoughts:\n&gt; \n&gt; I=\r\nn general, I&#39;m a fan of the Kent and Erich&#39;s plan to keep \n&gt; JUnit 4.0 as s=\r\nimple as possible, while still allowing \n&gt; impressive amounts of extension.=\r\n  To that end, it would be \n&gt; great to have a third party work on a souped-=\r\nup parameterized \n&gt; test runner with features like you mention here.\n\nFair =\r\nenough. (It shouldn&#39;t actually end up being too complicated, to be\nhonest.)=\r\n\n\nI just hope it&#39;s easy to apply those extensions when running in Eclipse.\n=\r\n(I don&#39;t imagine it would be hard, but it&#39;s worth bearing in mind.)\n\n&gt; I wr=\r\note a separate runner a while back that parameterizes \n&gt; tests by method, b=\r\nut felt ambivalent about it--it was very \n&gt; different from how parameterize=\r\nd tests had been done in JUnit \n&gt; 3, and I hadn&#39;t really wanted it yet in m=\r\ny own development, \n&gt; so I wasn&#39;t sure I&#39;d gotten it &quot;right&quot;, and I didn&#39;t =\r\nsubmit \n&gt; it to Kent.  However, you&#39;re not the first to request it.  In \n&gt; =\r\nany case, do you really want to have parameters on both the \n&gt; class and th=\r\ne methods?  That seems really complex.\n\nI know what you mean - but I think =\r\nI do. Sometimes I want to provide a\nlist of things for one test method to r=\r\nun through (and still getting all\nthe results when it fails on the first of=\r\n them). Other times I want to\nrun all the tests on both SQL Server and Orac=\r\nle (and HSQL, often).\n\nWhat I&#39;m not sure of is how often I need both at the=\r\n same time. Taking\nbaby steps, it would probably be best to first work on a=\r\nn extension\nwhich *only* parameterised test methods, using the existing ext=\r\nension\nwhen I want to parameterise by test instances.\n\n&gt; &gt;         // In ac=\r\ntual code, these would probably be enums, in my \n&gt; &gt; experience -\n&gt; &gt;      =\r\n   // they would provide mechanisms for connecting to the \n&gt; &gt; appropriate =\r\ndatabase,\n&gt; &gt;         // setting it up and tearing it down etc.\n&gt; &gt;        =\r\n public static String[] classParameters =3D {&quot;Oracle&quot;, &quot;SQL&quot;};\n&gt; \n&gt; Using a=\r\nn enum to contain the parameters is a cool idea.  \n\nIn this particular case=\r\n, the enum already exists - because it provides a\nload of helper support. I=\r\n probably wouldn&#39;t bother for enums which would\njust be names, effectively.=\r\n\n\n&gt; Would it be much easier than @Parameters public static \n&gt; List&lt;DbType&gt; =\r\nparameters() { return\n&gt; DbType.values() }?\n\nIn fact, I don&#39;t think the enum=\r\ns would be available &quot;inline&quot;. However,\nI&#39;d to be able to specify it as a f=\r\nield:\n\npublic static final databaseTypes =3D DbType.values();\n\n@Parameters =\r\n(field=3D&quot;databaseTypes&quot;)\n@Test\n...\n\n\n&gt; &gt;         @Test\n&gt; &gt;         @Parame=\r\nters(strings=3D{&quot;hello&quot;, &quot;there&quot;})\n&gt; &gt;         public void test3(String inp=\r\nut)\n&gt; &gt;         {\n&gt; &gt;             assertEquals(input, input.toLowerCase());=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;         }\n&gt; \n&gt; I like that a lot.\n\nMe too :)\n \n&gt; &gt; 2) Unless multiple =\r\nparameters are required, a single array (rather \n&gt; &gt; than an array of array=\r\ns) causes less confusion. I know that the \n&gt; &gt; counter-argument to that is =\r\nthat having two forms, one for \n&gt; &gt; single-parameter tests/constructors and=\r\n one for multi-parameter \n&gt; &gt; tests/constructors is ugly, but I personally =\r\nbelieve that it&#39;s \n&gt; &gt; justified in this case.\n&gt; \n&gt; I like your case here.\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; For the rest of your features, I think they&#39;re cool.  I&#39;d \n&gt; like to s=\r\nee a runner that did them, and play with it a while.\n\nI&#39;ll see what I can d=\r\no for you :)\n\n(The hard bit for me is developing it test-first. I can see h=\r\now an\nimplementation could easily work, but I *am* going to do this properl=\r\ny.\nUnfortunately I can see potentially tens of &quot;fake&quot; test classes - either=\r\n\nthat or one test which just logs everything and either works completely\nor=\r\n doesn&#39;t!\n\n&gt; &gt; 5) One nasty problem: you need to construct instances of the=\r\n test \n&gt; &gt; class just to count the test cases - and hope that the \n&gt; parame=\r\nters you \n&gt; &gt; get back then is the same as the ones you get when you&#39;re \n&gt; =\r\nready to run the tests.\n&gt; &gt; (You could cache the results, of course...)\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; That&#39;s a rough problem.  In general, I think that runners \n&gt; should avoid=\r\n constructing instances in order to count test \n&gt; cases.  Do you think it&#39;s=\r\n worth it?\n\nFortunately if I avoid parameterising instances at the same tim=\r\ne as\nmethods, I can avoid this. The only problem will be running the method=\r\n\ntwice, but that can&#39;t be too hard.\n\n&gt; &gt; Anyway, the bottom line is that I =\r\ncan see *huge* benefits in this \n&gt; &gt; approach in quite a few of our existin=\r\ng test code. Does anyone have \n&gt; &gt; any major objections to the above, or sh=\r\nall I give it a whirl?\n&gt; \n&gt; Absolutely give it a whirl.\n\nOkay. Will report =\r\nback when I&#39;ve got something working.\n\nJon\n\n\nClearswift monitors, controls =\r\nand protects all its messaging traffic in compliance with its corporate ema=\r\nil policy using Clearswift products.\nFind out more about Clearswift, its so=\r\nlutions and services at http://www.clearswift.com\n\nThis communication is co=\r\nnfidential and may contain privileged information intended solely for the n=\r\named addressee(s).
