But sometimes you might want to ensure that\n&gt; complex algorithms work corrently and there it could be helpful to\n&gt; access the inner state of a class. See it as a kind of last resort \nto\n&gt; be sure that a test case tests the right stuff completely. It should\n&gt; not become the general way of testing your production classes.\n&gt; \n&gt; Regards,\n&gt; \n&gt; Andreas.\n\nMy experiences have been the same as Andreas.  I tend to favour \nprotected over private in my objects then if I place the test in the \nsame package as my class I can test practically everything.  \n\nIf I do want to place my tests in a separate test directory, I can \nmake a child class of my parent class (extends) and then proxy calls \nup to the parent via the child and test in the tests directory.\n\nThe extra work required is creating the child class and calling super \nup to the parent whenever a test is called on the child.\n\nJonathan\n\n\n",
