Both options are valid, but are definitely not the same \nthing.\n\nMy original question that started this thread was more aimed at the \nsecond option (validating the output of the JSP, not the contents of the \n.jsp file itself).\n\nI am not aware of any validators for the &quot;common&quot; JSP format that most \npeople use. When I say &quot;common&quot; I mean a JSP in which you have scriplet, \nexpressions and declaration tags mixed with taglibs, jsp tags and \ntemplate tags. The obvious reason for this is that these documents don&#39;t \nreally follow a nice referenceable document model (i.e. they are not \nreadily XML parseable). If you can write a JSP using the JSP XML syntax \n(detailed in the JSP spec) then you can validate with a regular \nvalidating XML parser. The trick is that it becomes cumbersome to \ninclude valid XML tags around all the embedded Java code throughout the \npage - this is the reason we opted not to bother.\n\nHowever, there seems to be some light on the horizon to solve this \nproblem. We have been experimenting with the EL features from JSTL and \nhave found we can eliminate most, if not all, of our scriptlets etc. In \nthis case the need for cumbersome additional XML tags disappears and \nwriting the JSP in the XML syntax becomes pretty easy. Then you could \nuse the previously mentioned validating XML parser to validate your JSPs.\n\nCraig\n\n\nYagiz Erkan wrote on 9/8/2004, 6:47 AM:\n\n &gt; Is there something similar for JSP validation?\n &gt;\n &gt; - Yagiz -\n &gt;\n &gt;\n &gt;\n &gt;\n &gt;\n &gt; Yahoo!
