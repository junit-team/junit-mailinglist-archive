What I learned\nis =\r\nthat when I had a test case that was a subclass of TestCase (to be\nspecific=\r\n, my test case was a subclass of a subclass of TestCase), I had\nthe &quot;Unroot=\r\ned Test&quot; problem.  When I made a test case in a new project\nfrom scratch th=\r\nat didn&#39;t extend TestCase but only used @Test\nannotations, Eclipse didn&#39;t r=\r\nun the unrooted tests.\n\nWhen I get some more time, I want to dig into it mo=\r\nre and try to figure\nout why this is the case.  But I&#39;m stuck in backlog es=\r\ntimation for the\nnext 3 days, and then it&#39;s Christmas.

In the olden days, with \n&gt; &gt; Eclipse 3.0 and=\r\n JUnit 3.8, I could select a single test method in \n&gt; &gt; the Outline view an=\r\nd run just that method.\n&gt; &gt; Nowadays, whenever I try to do that, Eclipse&#39;s =\r\ntest runner runs all \n&gt; &gt; the tests in the class. The results are shown in =\r\na tree, and the \n&gt; &gt; tests I didn&#39;t ask to be run are all under a node call=\r\ned &quot;Unrooted \n&gt; &gt; Tests [Runner: JUnit 4]&quot;.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; So, I figured there mus=\r\nt be some simple explanation, and immediately\n\n&gt; &gt; did a Google search. And=\r\n it found nothing on topic. So I searched \n&gt; &gt; the Eclipse documentation an=\r\nd website for &quot;unrooted tests&quot; and again\n\n&gt; &gt; got nothing. So I searched on=\r\n this Yahoo Group&#39;s message archive, \n&gt; &gt; and again found nothing.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nAm I the only person in the world who has ever had this problem with\n\n&gt; &gt; r=\r\nunning a single test method from Eclipse? Or am I searching for the\n\n&gt; &gt; we=\r\nb&#39;s most suppressed secret?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Someone please tell me you&#39;ve seen this=\r\n problem too! And why is \n&gt; &gt; there nothing written up about these mysterio=\r\nus &quot;Unrooted Tests&quot; in \n&gt; &gt; all the places I looked?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Cheers,\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; Todd.\n&gt; &gt; ----\n&gt; \n&gt; .\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message ha=\r\nve been removed]\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n \nYahoo!
