The problem is that I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; having difficulties accessing protected members of my EJB. Example: I<br/>\n&gt; have a session bean that I&#39;m unit testing and I want to test a<br/>\n&gt; protected method but it appears that I can only access the bean<br/>\n&gt; through the remote interface. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>There is absolutely, positively, indubitably /nothing/ to be gained from <br/>\nmaking any method of an EJB implementation class anything other than <br/>\npublic, with the lone possible exception of stopping some idiot from <br/>\nsubclassing it. (So don&#39;t subclass it!)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">  &gt; Does this mean I have to define all of<br/>\n&gt; the protected members in the remote interface so my test can access<br/>\n&gt; them? The problem that appears is when you lookup the session bean.<br/>\n&gt; You get a reference to the home interface and call create on that<br/>\n&gt; interface. This returns a proxy to your bean and the proxy only<br/>\n&gt; implements the remote interface. I need direct access to my bean to<br/>\n&gt; get a good unit test. Is this possible? Am I doing something wrong?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Ah, you are ready for step 2: testing the logic of the EJB without the EJB.<br/>\n<br/>\nLet me guess: your non-public method does something entirely outside the <br/>\nrealm of J2EE. Would the method survive without the container? If so, <br/>\nmerely instantiate the class and test it, like a POJO. Yes, the method <br/>\nwould need to be public, but at least you could avoid even a fake container.<br/>\n<br/>\nDetails in _JUnit Recipes_, chapter 11.<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJ. B.
