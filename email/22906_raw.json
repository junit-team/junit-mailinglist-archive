Pretty\n&gt; nice :)\n&gt;\n&gt; =\r\nBut now we have to take a screenshot on failed tests. I added the\n&gt; seleniu=\r\nm.captureScreenshot(screenshotPath); on @After, but it takes\n&gt; screenshots =\r\nof all tests.\n&gt;\n&gt; Then I tried the TestWatchman @Rule to override the faile=\r\nd function and\n&gt; take the screenshot there. But this doesn&#39;t work, because =\r\nfailed is\n&gt; called after closing the selenium session.\n&gt;\n&gt; So I don&#39;t reall=\r\ny know where to place the captureScreenshot function.\n&gt; How can I catch the=\r\n failure before @After is executed?\n&gt;\n&gt; thanks :)\n&gt; --\n&gt; =A1paz y baile!\n&gt; =\r\nhttp://elopio.net\n&gt;\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]=\r\n\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n",
