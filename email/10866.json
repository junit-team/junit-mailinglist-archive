To answer this:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; That would sort of imply that the databases behave the same way,<br/>\n </span></blockquote>but I&#39;m not sure why that would be my direct concern.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;re migrating from an MS Access database to Oracle 8.1.7.  They use<br/>\ndifferent variants of the SQL Standard.  Specifically, Access allows &quot;LEFT<br/>\nJOIN&quot; and &quot;INNER JOIN&quot; syntax, while Oracle requires the &quot;(+)&quot; syntax.  We<br/>\nwant to test that all of the queries that were touched return the same,<br/>\nsometimes large, sets of results.  So, it seems like we need to run the<br/>\nqueries on each configuration or database and verify that the results are<br/>\nidentical, row for row, and in order.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  -----Original Message-----<br/>\n  From: Brett Neumeier [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:random@...\">random@...</a>]<br/>\n  Sent: Thursday, April 15, 2004 11:40 AM<br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n  Subject: Re: [junit] Database testing puzzle<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   On Thu, 2004-04-15 at 11:14, Dave Bender wrote:<br/>\n  &gt; [..] But I&#39;m puzzled, then, about how to do testing to verify that the<br/>\n  &gt; results from the database interactions are identical since I have to<br/>\n  &gt; stop and start the application to switch databases.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I might be missing something, but what I would do is switch the database<br/>\n  that is being used during the tests, then run them and make sure that<br/>\n  all the tests pass.<br/>\n<br/>\n  That is to say, I&#39;m not so much interested in whether the results from<br/>\n  the database interactions are identical; I&#39;m mostly interested in making<br/>\n  sure that the results of using the app with Database A are correct,<br/>\n  andthat the results of using the app with Database B are correct as<br/>\n  well.
