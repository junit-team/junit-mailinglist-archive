Especially if your tests require two or three\n&gt; statements to set up in the test method (not in setUp()), in which case\n&gt; there is even more to be gained to run more than one assert so you don&#39;t\n&gt; have to duplicate this code in other test methods.\n\nThe sophomores taking MIT&#39;s software engineering lab were given a test \nsuite last week that had dozens of asserts per test method. One student \nmanaged to have an infinite loop in one of her methods. To figure out \nwhich of the twenty calls to that method in a single test was causing \nthe infinite loop, she had no choice but to put printlns between each \nassert. Certainly if I saw this in my own code (rather than code my \nclass staff gave me), I would think strongly about separating each of \nthose asserts into its own method.\n\nMore test methods mean more information: with 20 asserts and 20 tests, I \nknow exactly which of the asserts fail. In one test method, I know only \nthe first.\n\n&gt; Also, the fix you show in your documentation is simplistic. What if the\n&gt; code to be extracted is specific to that test method? If you move it to\n&gt; setUp(), you are suddenly charging *all* the other test methods of \n&gt; that same\n&gt; class with this set up cost that they have no need for.\n\nOr you could create a new class. Is that too expensive?\n\nAs the FAQ says, I like to take the temptation to put more than one \nassert in a method as a sign that I could do something better with my \ndesign. If there are two or three lines of setup, could that be a single \nline in a better API? If testing one idea requires three different \naccessor calls, could I create a single accessor or equals method that \nwould do that work? If I can&#39;t think of names for the different tests, \nare they really testing different things?\n\nOne downside is that lots of methods does take up a lot of screen space \nin my IDE. Unless Java introduces an &quot;in-line block&quot; syntax, however, \nit&#39;s probably the best we can do for now.\n\nDavid Saff\n\n",
