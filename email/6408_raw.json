A particularly tricky one it seems.\n\n&gt; Leaving out the backdoor reflection approach for the moment\n\nYes, please.\n\n&gt; 1) &quot;pollute&quot; the interface by making methods public that should be\n&gt; private.\n\n&quot;Pollute&quot; is a stong word.  Just because a method is public doesn&#39;t \nmean it has to be part of the published interface.\n\nMy view is that parts of a class that are part of the &quot;public \ninterface&quot; and, as such, meant for general use (and that you have \ncommitted to supporting long term) should be defined in some other \nway that simple the visibility modifier of the method (in this \ncase).  I would use JavaDoc comments (and fairly detailed ones at \nthat) for things that are part of the public interface, and \n(typically) no comments for everything else.  Then creating JavaDoc \ngives you a document that defines the public interface.\n\n&gt; Some argue that this is the correct thing to do, but generally \naccepted\n&gt; principles of good design seem to require making your public \ninterface as\n&gt; minimal as possible.\n\nYes.  So, to go further than the above... and on reflection a better \nway, define the &quot;public interface&quot; by making it a Java interface that \nyour class implements.  Then make the interface documented and \navailable.  Clients must write to the interface, implementation \ndetails are irrelavant to them, as they should be.\n\n&gt; 2) Only test the public interface, perhaps giving up detailed\n&gt; testing of internal logic.\n[...]\n&gt; Somehow to me (as an admitted TDD newbie), it just seemed better to \n&gt; be able to bang on these internal methods directly, rather than \n&gt;relying on the public methods to access them. \n\nIf you are practicing TDD, you should not be &quot;giving up detailed \ntesting of internal logic.&quot;\n\nWith TDD you define what you need in terms of external behavior, \nwrite a test for it, them implement it.  Finally you clean up by \nrefactoring.  So as far as your tests are concerned everything that \nthe class has to do IS public.  When I add a new method in reponse to \na test, it&#39;s public.  When I refactor and extract methods, I make \nthem private.  That&#39;s the only way I make methods private.\n\n&gt; 3) Make more classes... change the private methods into public\n&gt; methods of new simple classes. \n\nThat&#39;s a another approach, but I would only do that of the \nfunctionallity was needed somewhere else.  And, I&#39;d most likely also \nextract an interface from the new class, and have clients work \nagainst the interface only.\n \n&gt; 4) Make the methods &#39;protected&#39;\n\nI only do this in response to the need of a subclass to have access \nto somethign that was originally private.. and I try to avoid it as \nmuch as possible.\n\n&gt; have your Test class inherit from your\n&gt; class under test.\n\nGawk!  Ack!\n\n&gt; I&#39;d love to hear the group&#39;s thoughts...\n\nWell, I can&#39;t speak for the group.. but these are my thoughts.  (Made \nthem myself).\n\nDave\n\n\n",
