They are simple codes that writes into the database. The rule is a \nProject must be added before a Experiment can be added. This is \nbecause Experiment has a foreign key that points to Project. \n \nSo I have two test class, ProjectTest and ExperimentTest.  \n \nIn my ProjectTest I have a testCreateProject test. But in my \nExperimentTest where I have my testCreateExperiment test, I need to \ncreate a project before it will be successful. \n \nWhats the practice for this? Do I put the createProject inside my \ntestCreateExperiment method? Then I will be actually testing two different \nclass (Project and Experiment) in a single method \n(testCreateExperiment).. \n \nIf anyone is going to suggest control the order of executing the test (i.e. \nrun ProjectTest before ExperimentTest), note that I need the return value \nfrom testCreateProject in testCreateExperiment. \n \nThanks \n \nSebastian Ho \n\n\n\n",
