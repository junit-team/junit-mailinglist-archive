If I had to unit test\nsomething like the controler, I would rather write own mock implementations\nof greeter and sender to test the controler: By doing so I will have no\ntesting code in my production code. Does that seem too much of an overhead,\nor for what other reason is Eric Allen&#39;s approach more promising?\n\nToyin\n\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: &quot;Jason Rogers&quot; &lt;jason.rogers@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;junit@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Tuesday, June 19, 2001 3:20 PM\nSubject: RE: [junit] Does this have a bad smell\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;     &gt;     I am a regular reader of Eric Allen&#39;s series at IBM\n&gt;     &gt; devoloperWorks.\n&gt;     &gt; In his newest article\n&gt;     &gt; (http://www-106.ibm.com/developerworks/java/library/j-diag\n&gt;     &gt; 0612.html) he\n&gt;     &gt; intermingles test code with production code. In my\n&gt;     &gt; opinion, this has a bad\n&gt;     &gt; smell, but ... well, I am interested of your opinion as I\n&gt;     &gt; am not to sure if\n&gt;     &gt; I am right.\n&gt;\n&gt; Actually, I thought it was a *neat* idea, if needed.  He points out to\n&gt; places where the need for this might be apparent, you decide on the need.\n&gt; Recorder is just a special case of a listener.  You don&#39;t have to\nimplement\n&gt; it the way Eric did, I think his implementation is a case of DTSTTCPW for\n&gt; his article.  More than likely, if you wanted some kind of Recorder like\n&gt; this you would have an update method on the observed classes that would\n&gt; cause the observer(s) to update itself.  If you wanted to get specific\n&gt; information about the class that is updating (like the method name), you\n&gt; could use the second parameter of the update method from the Observer\n&gt; interface.  Or if you have need of that param for something else, use\ndouble\n&gt; dispatching to call back on the observable.\n&gt;\n&gt; In short, it&#39;s a bad smell if you don&#39;t need it (either through his\n&gt; implementation or through your own).\n&gt;\n&gt; -Jason\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
