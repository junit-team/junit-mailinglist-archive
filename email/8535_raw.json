If your class implements three\n&gt;i=\r\nnterfaces, then you have three test cases for that class, each a\n&gt;subclass =\r\nof the corresponding abstract test for each interface. Run them\n&gt;all. No la=\r\nw says you must have one test case per production class, and\n&gt;in fact, you =\r\nprobably shouldn&#39;t!\n&gt;\n&gt;\n[JLT]\n&gt;It&#39;s a simple matter of keeping the test tre=\r\ne as understandable as the\n&gt;source it is testing.\n\nIf you have tried both w=\r\nays and encountered this problem, then great; otherwise, I suggest you resi=\r\nst the temptation to &quot;keep the source simple&quot; at the cost of doing what you=\r\n need to do. xUnit users often make their test fixtures too complex because=\r\n they want to adhere to &quot;one test class per production class&quot;. The complex =\r\nfixture with 50 tests is more difficult to navigate than five tests with si=\r\nmple fixtures and 10 tests each. This is my experience.\n\nFor the book I&#39;m w=\r\norking on, I have the following three test fixtures for testing Java&#39;s Coll=\r\nection interface.\n\n* BagTest\n* EmptyBagTest\n* HelloTwiceBagTest\n\nOther than=\r\n the somewhat obscure &quot;hello twice bag&quot; (a bag with the object &quot;hello&quot; in i=\r\nt twice), I think this is pretty easy to read. Do you find anything in thos=\r\ne names that makes it difficult to understand what&#39;s tested where? The alte=\r\nrnative is a bunch of test methods like:\n\n* testEmpty_Empty\n* testEmpty_Hel=\r\nloTwice\n* testEmpty\n\nA group of these per behavior to test. Such duplicatio=\r\nn is truly unnecessary and having multiple test fixtures is just as easy (i=\r\nf not easier) to read and understand.\n\nUnderstand that I&#39;m talking about th=\r\ne fear I sense you have about making the test code complex, and not attacki=\r\nng you or your ideas. The way I see it: either way, it&#39;s complex; but I thi=\r\nnk having many fixtures is less complex than one big monolithic fixture. If=\r\n you favor cohesive production classes (and probably you do), then why not =\r\ncohesive test fixtures?\n\n&gt;If there are too many test classes testing a\n&gt;sin=\r\ngle source class, it become difficult to look at a package for the\n&gt;first t=\r\nime and understand what is going on.\n\nIt may become difficult, but not if t=\r\nhe tests are well named. The same is true for any code: complex code with b=\r\nad names is difficult to read; complex code with good names is often not-th=\r\nat-difficult to read. Since the complexity is there either way, why not go =\r\ndown the path that allows the best names?\n\n&gt; The link that Paolo sent on\n&gt;a=\r\nn earlier post has a link showing the use of inner classes to organize\n&gt;the=\r\n abstract test cases. The benefit is that I can enter a package, look\n&gt;for =\r\na single class WidgetTest.java and be able to track back all of the\n&gt;tests =\r\nassociated with Widget.java.\n\nAgreed, and so using nested classes for relat=\r\ned fixtures is not a bad idea at all. I just don&#39;t think that it&#39;s necessar=\r\nily any clearer: it&#39;s just all in one file rather than in three.\n\n[JLT]\n&gt;&gt;A=\r\nlso, only some objects implement the equals method. These\n&gt;&gt;I have a standa=\r\nrd set of tests to ensure that null and a few other\n&gt;&gt;scenarios are handled=\r\n correctly (as well as the hashcode / equals\n&gt;&gt;relationship). I would like =\r\nto have these standard tests available for\n&gt;&gt;different objects without havi=\r\nng to rewrite them all the time.\n&gt;\n[JBR]\n&gt;GSBase&#39;s EqualsTester for testing=\r\n equals(). JUnit-addons also has\n&gt;something, but I can&#39;t remember the name =\r\nof it.\n&gt;\n[JLT]\n&gt;Thanks, I&#39;ll check it out.\n\nEnjoy. There is talk of GSBase&#39;=\r\ns testing utilities merging with JUnit-addons. That would be nice. :)\n\nTake=\r\n care.\n\nJ. B.
