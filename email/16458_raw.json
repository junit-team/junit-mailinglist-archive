I do \n\nknow that it&#39;s possible to include JUnit tasks in An=\r\nt&#39;s build.xml, but\nI&#39;m looking for a way \n\nto make JUnit tests mandatory fo=\r\nr every piece of code that&#39;s written\nand commited to our \n\nCVS. Is there a =\r\nway to control uploads to CVS regarding JUnit?\n\nAnother info I&#39;d like to ha=\r\nve: is there a way to decide dynamically\nwhich tests Ant has to \n\nrun (like=\r\n running tests only for changed parts of source code, for\nexample)? I do kn=\r\now that \n\nit is common to run all the tests all the time, I&#39;d just like to =\r\nget\nto know all the \n\npossibilities Ant offers when it comes to JUnit.\n\n\n\n\n=\r\n\n\n\n",
