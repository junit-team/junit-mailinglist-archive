The=\r\n syntax\nmerely says\nthat the test makes an assumption. Given such an assump=\r\ntion, the framework\nmight do a number of things, only one of which is to tr=\r\neat the connection as\na dependency.\n\nIn my own work - which of course is no=\r\nt junit-related - I&#39;m looking ways to\nspecify relations like this *without*=\r\n calling for any specific behavior on\nthe\npart of the framework.\n\nOf course=\r\n, the &quot;obvious&quot; and perhaps simplest implementation is to run\nthe &quot;assumed&quot;=\r\n test first and skip the test using the assume in the case\nwhere it fails. =\r\nBut I like the idea that the user might express known or\nbelieved-to-be-tru=\r\ne logical relations among tests while the framework\nwould be free to make u=\r\nse of that information in ways not necessarily\npredictable by the user.\n\nAs=\r\n an example, imagine a framework that gave a message like\n&quot;You stated that =\r\nTestA assumes TestB but TestA passed even\nthough TestB failed.&quot;\n\nCharlie\nOn=\r\n Wed, Sep 14, 2011 at 10:41 AM, Dale Emery &lt;dale@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt; **\n=\r\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi Stephen and all,\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Nope not a mock at all.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; More like Tes=\r\ntNG&#39;s &quot;dependsOnMethods&quot; feature.\n&gt;\n&gt; I understand your desire for this. I =\r\nalso understand the JUnit guys&#39;\n&gt; reluctance to implement it. My intermedia=\r\nte-ish experience with TestNG\n&gt; leaves me with the conclusion that inter-te=\r\nst dependencies lead to madness.\n&gt; To be fair, I had already concluded that=\r\n before working with clients who\n&gt; insisted on specifying inter-test depend=\r\nencies.\n&gt;\n&gt; My first half-baked thought is to use a Rule to prevent running=\r\n methods\n&gt; that depend on another method that has already failed. But that =\r\nwould work\n&gt; only if the tests were run in the appropriate order.\n&gt;\n&gt; So my=\r\n next half-baked thought is to write a custom Runner that builds the\n&gt; depe=\r\nndency graph and sequences the tests accordingly. Then either the runner\n&gt; =\r\nor a rule could decide whether to run a test. I&#39;m confident that a runner\n&gt;=\r\n could do what you want, but that requires delving into the arcane bits of\n=\r\n&gt; JUnit.\n&gt;\n&gt; A final half-baked thought: What if you ran all the tests, the=\r\nn used the\n&gt; dependency graph only to mark the results somehow, so as to hi=\r\nghlight the\n&gt; tests on which others depend. If you see a swarm of failures,=\r\n and the\n&gt; display indicates that some common prerequisite test also failed=\r\n, that would\n&gt; aid your investigation.\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;ve seen situations where some =\r\nprerequisite test fails, but some of the\n&gt; dependent tests pass. Sometimes =\r\nthe prerequisite test is lying to me (and I\n&gt; need to fix that). Sometimes =\r\nthe dependency is over-specified--the dependent\n&gt; test doesn&#39;t depend on ev=\r\nerything that the prerequisite test tests (which\n&gt; means I need to refactor=\r\n the prerequisite test and the dependency\n&gt; specifications). Sometimes it m=\r\neans that the prerequisite test fails\n&gt; intermittently (which means I need =\r\nto track down the uncontrolled factors\n&gt; that affect the test).\n&gt;\n&gt; Skippin=\r\ng the dependent tests hides that information. Running them and\n&gt; marking th=\r\nem would highlight that\n&gt;\n&gt; Dale\n&gt;\n&gt; --\n&gt; Dale Emery\n&gt; Consultant to softwa=\r\nre teams and leaders\n&gt; http://dhemery.com\n&gt;\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this me=\r\nssage have been removed]\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have =\r\nbeen removed]\n\n\n",
