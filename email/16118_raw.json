What I want is to have things like a Description of\n the test suite, which could be added to the JUnit test via something\n like a metadata tag.  Then, when I run the tests and generate the\n results into an XML file, it would add that description to the results\n file.\n \n \n Is this possible?  I would like to add a few more fields than that but\n it&#39;s one example.  I&#39;d also like to not have to create an\n implementatin of TestCase since I already have existing tests and\n instead would just like to be able to add the new information in some\n way, such as a metadata tag.\n \n Thanks,\n Shay\n \n \n \n \n \n \n             \n\n        SPONSORED LINKS   \n                                                    Basic programming language                                       C programming language                                       Computer programming languages                                                                     The c programming language                                       C   programming language                                       List of programming languages                                                                 \n      \n---------------------------------\n   YAHOO!
