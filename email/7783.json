What is the mythical problem that<br/>\n&gt;would get<br/>\n&gt;me into trouble? Or is it just some design guideline or best practice that<br/>\n&gt;we<br/>\n&gt;should follow when it make sense?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Typically the more tests there are that depends on the particular state of a database, the more difficult it is to execute those tests when you need to.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, consider the case where you create a certain simple set of test data to satisfy the needs of today&#39;s tests. You put that test data into the database and execute your tests. Everything is fine. Tomorrow, you write a test that requires additional data. You add the additional data to satisfy the new tests *and* change the expected results for some of the old tests, so you need to change the old tests. If you do this often enough, it will drive you nuts.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;I indeed put the persistence tests into a separate suite. It is not mean<br/>\n&gt;to run<br/>\n&gt;everytime it compiles. People need to know it write into the database and<br/>\n&gt;thus<br/>\n&gt;need to have it properly setup. The create() method itself is fairly<br/>\n&gt;straight<br/>\n&gt;forward. It&#39;s just a few setString() and executeQuery(). I don&#39;t know if it<br/>\n&gt;worth the effort to mock the infrastructure to test these few statements<br/>\n&gt;really<br/>\n&gt;got executed. The most interesting part for me is to see the queries got<br/>\n&gt;executed correctly and the fields do match the schema.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>The most interesting part for me is to see the query string is correctly generated. I don&#39;t generally feel the need to test that the database vendor correctly implements the JDBC standard. As long as I can generate the SQL query correctly and can make business objects from a ResultSet, the rest is up to the database vendor, and their code probably works. If it doesn&#39;t, then we&#39;ll find out soon enough.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;P.S. For some reason my mails to this list only get listed after I sent it<br/>\n&gt;for<br/>\n&gt;2 days. This make the conversion not very interactive. Does anyone has this<br/>\n&gt;problem?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This mailing list is moderated. This means that messages need to be approved before they are posted.
