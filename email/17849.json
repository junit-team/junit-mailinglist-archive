However, as the system starts<br/>\n&gt; &gt; to get complicated those simple constructors sometimes become<br/>\n&gt; &gt; complications because of the need to have mocks for unit tests.  <br/>\n&gt; Later<br/>\n&gt; &gt; they become even greater complications because of the need to break<br/>\n&gt; &gt; or invert dependencies between modules.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; At such point as that becomes a real problem, I&#39;m willing to  <br/>\n&gt; refactor to<br/>\n&gt; accomplish this. However in my experience most classes are not reused,<br/>\n&gt; most do not need to be mocked, most do not need to be decoupled, and<br/>\n&gt; very few classes need multiple implementations.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Agreed on all points except, possibly, the definition of the term  <br/>\n&quot;most&quot;.  If by that you mean &quot;more than half&quot; then I agree.  If, on  <br/>\nthe other hand you mean &quot;the overwhelming majority&quot; then I don&#39;t.  In  <br/>\nmy experience quite a few classes wind up needing this kind of  <br/>\ndecoupling.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; My objection is not to using these techniques in the rare cases where<br/>\n&gt; it&#39;s actually necessary.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Rare?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; My objection is to starting by assuming that<br/>\n&gt; the simplest thing (concrete classes with constructors) can&#39;t possibly<br/>\n&gt; work, and jumping straight into the deep end every time.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I agree with that.  I find, however, that I *do* move many of them to  <br/>\ninterfaces in short order.<br/>\n<br/>\n----<br/>\nRobert C.
