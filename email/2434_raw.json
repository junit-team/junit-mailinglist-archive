I \nunderstand that TestResult acts as a collector of test results (which ones \npassed, failed, and had errors). What I don&#39;t understand is:\n\nWhy does TestCase.run(TestResult) call TestResult.run(TestCase) ?\nWhy does TestResult.run(TestCase) then call TestCase.runBare() ?\n\nI&#39;m trying to write a TestCase which will repeatedly run a test until the \ntest passes or a timeout occurs. I need to understand which run method to \noverride.\n\nThnaks,\nChristopher Helck\n****************************************************************************\nChristopher Helck\nchelck@...\n\nThe information contained in this email is confidential.
