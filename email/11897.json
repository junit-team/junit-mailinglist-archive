They are simple codes that writes into the database. The rule is a <br/>\nProject must be added before a Experiment can be added. This is <br/>\nbecause Experiment has a foreign key that points to Project. <br/>\n <br/>\nSo I have two test class, ProjectTest and ExperimentTest.  <br/>\n <br/>\nIn my ProjectTest I have a testCreateProject test. But in my <br/>\nExperimentTest where I have my testCreateExperiment test, I need to <br/>\ncreate a project before it will be successful. <br/>\n <br/>\nWhats the practice for this? Do I put the createProject inside my <br/>\ntestCreateExperiment method? Then I will be actually testing two different <br/>\nclass (Project and Experiment) in a single method <br/>\n(testCreateExperiment).. <br/>\n <br/>\nIf anyone is going to suggest control the order of executing the test (i.e. <br/>\nrun ProjectTest before ExperimentTest), note that I need the return value <br/>\nfrom testCreateProject in testCreateExperiment. <br/>\n <br/>\nThanks <br/>\n <br/>\nSebastian Ho</div>",
