Nor can you generate things like network-delay &\n&gt;simulataneous hits in a fashion loadrunner does.\n&gt;\n&gt;So guys there who are doing serious web-testing (blackbox) , try\n&gt;loadrunner, its pricey but worth the moolah! & efforts.\n&gt;\n&gt;&lt;&lt;what am i doing talking off loadrunner on a junit - mailing list&gt;&gt;\n&gt;Well i thought there were many people asking here about blackbox\n&gt;testing and decided to draw their attention to this nice tool.\n&gt;\n&gt;No offense meant to rest of the juniteers.\n&gt;\n&gt;regards\n&gt;krishna\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;--- In junit@y..., Jalam Singh Bhati &lt;jalams@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Hi,\n&gt; &gt;   You can test Java (or J2EE) application using Jtest\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n",
