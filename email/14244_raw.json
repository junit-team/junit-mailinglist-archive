B. Rainsberger\n&gt; \n&gt;  &gt; But still, I don&#39;t know why it&#39;s a design smell to have to invoke\n&gt;  &gt; super.xxx() when you override and want to decorate a method&#39;s behavior.\n&gt; \n&gt; Because you need to remember to invoke super and if you don&#39;t, everything\n&gt; will break.\n&gt; \n&gt; Imagine a world where whenever you want to override a method, you need to\n&gt; look up its javadoc to know if you need to call super or not...\n&gt; \n&gt;  &gt; That&#39;s just OO.\n&gt; \n&gt; It&#39;s well established as poor OO.  Real OO recommends to override methods to\n&gt; specialize them.  If you want to provide functionality that should always be\n&gt; &quot;enhanced&quot; by subclasses and never replaced, you should provide template\n&gt; methods (&quot;hooks&quot;), as you correctly pointed out.\n\nI have already commented on that, Cedric. Note the hypothesis above: \n&quot;...when you...want to decorate a method&#39;s behavior.&quot; If you don&#39;t like \nDecorator, that&#39;s fine, I don&#39;t like Singleton, but Decorator is not \n(necessarily) poor OO. (Neither is Singleton, for that matter.)\n\n&gt; The following code guarantees that Parent.setUp() will always be run, no\n&gt; matter how Parent is subclassed:\n&gt; \n&gt; public class Parent {\n&gt;   private void setUp() {\n&gt;     onSetUp();  // hook\n&gt;     // do the thing that should always be invoked\n&gt;   }\n&gt; \n&gt;   public void onSetUp() {}  // default is to do nothing\n&gt; }\n&gt; \n&gt; public class SubClass extends Parent {\n&gt;   public void onSetUp() {\n&gt;     // add my own logic to Parent.setUp()\n&gt;   }\n&gt; }\n\nBut Cedric, what happens when a subclass of SubClass needs to do even \nmore in its setUp()? Of course, we know the answer: we haven&#39;t solved \nthe problem in general, but merely put it off for most of the cases that \nmatter. That&#39;s fine. Since TestCase is already designed as your Parent \nclass is (where your setUp() is TestCase&#39;s runTest() and your onSetUp() \nis its setUp()) it looks like JUnit&#39;s already doing the right thing... \nor, at least, the &quot;right enough&quot; thing.\n\n&gt;  &gt; As I wrote elsewhere, if super.xxx() bothers\n&gt;  &gt; you, refactor to Template Method.\n&gt; \n&gt; It&#39;s not always possible since it depends on whether the base class\n&gt; implemented the Template Method pattern or not (JUnit didn&#39;t).\n\n...but JUnit&#39;s setUp() method does nothing, and never needs to do \nanything, and never will do anything, so you never need to invoke \nsuper.setUp() except when subclassing from your own subclass of \nTestCase, over which you should have the required control.\n-- \nJ.
