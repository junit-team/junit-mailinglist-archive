Are your\ntest methods public?  Couple suggestions.\n\n1. Post the source code of this CalendarTest class to the group.\n\n2. Get the JUnit samples running from the command line before trying\nanything with the IDE.\n\n3. Try creating your first test case from the Vector test case sample that\ncomes with JUnit.\n\naside: Java packages conventionally have all lower case names (Calendar).\n\nScott Stirling\nMacromedia\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: Rick Denman\n\n\nI am teaching a course in extreme programming this spring, and I am\nplanning to use JUnit in the IDE Kawa. I am a newbie to JUnit and to\nthis\ngroup, so I searched the archives of this group for the answer to my\nquestion. All I found was the same question (with no satisfactory\nanswer)\nback in a thread in February of 2001. \n\nNamely, when I try to add tests to my project by extending the TestCase\nclass, and then run JUnit (either statically or from the plugin), I get\na\nmessage that looks like:\n\n1)\nwarning(junit.framework.TestSuite$1)junit.framework.AssertionFailedError\n:\nNo tests found in Calendar.CalendarTest \tat\nCalendar.CalendarTest.main(CalendarTest.java:11) \n\nIn other words, the test cases are not being found. I have all the\nparameters and classpath variables, etc. set up as described in the\nprevious thread, and the web directions for setting up JUnit in Kawa.\n\nHas anyone found a solution to this problem?\n\nRick Denman\nSouthwestern University\n\n",
