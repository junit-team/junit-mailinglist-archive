What could such a metric tell me that I don&#39;t\n&gt; already know?\n&gt;\n&gt; Kent\n\nThe above examples all indicate that you checked some condition, although\nsome are more meaningful than others. Your point is well taken that one\nassert may be more heavily laden with information than others.\n\nSo it really comes down to information content. If you have to report the\neffectiveness of your tests, typically to justify your efforts (and whys of\nthis are subject to debate elsewhere), then you want meaningful,\ninformation-rich metrics that are easy/transparent to gather.\n\nMy point is that there is more information content in your average assert\ncount than test case count. It&#39;s not very high in content but still higher.\nSome asserts imply more than others, as Kent&#39;s examples above show.\n\nSo assert is not a great metric but is certainly easy to derive, so why not\nuse it? It also promotes use of asserts, which is a good thing. Sometimes\npeople will create tests that have too few assertions and think they are\ndone if they run without exceptions. Reporting an assertion count in results\nwould make people aware of their lack of assertions. Of course you can\nalways get crazy and do derived metrics such as assert to LOC ratios, etc.\nbut I think that may be beyond the spirit of XP/JUnit.\n\nMike\n\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In junit@y..., &quot;Michael Silverstein&quot; &lt;msilverstein@s...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; I don&#39;t have a strong opinion one way or another but I&#39;ve seen a\n&gt; number of\n&gt; &gt; appends that held up some number of tests as a metric of the\n&gt; effectiveness\n&gt; &gt; of their unit testing. It would strike me that a more meaningful\n&gt; metric\n&gt; &gt; would be the number of asserts, since that indicates how many\n&gt; conditions\n&gt; &gt; were checked for correctness. So it is true that a unit test passes\n&gt; or it\n&gt; &gt; doesn&#39;t and if it doesn&#39;t, you fix it and move on. However, if\n&gt; someone is\n&gt; &gt; going to tout metrics, they should at least pick one that is as\n&gt; meaningful\n&gt; &gt; as possible.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
