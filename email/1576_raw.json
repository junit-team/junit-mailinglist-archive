These super\nclasses could contain all of the test data you need or invoke on an XML file\nthat you create to contain the data.\n\nFWIW: JXUnit doesn&#39;t seem to be *that* much of a learning curve once you get\npast the documentation ;)\n\n    &gt; -----Original Message-----\n    &gt; From: Laird, William [mailto:blaird@...]\n    &gt; Sent: Wednesday, June 20, 2001 11:16 AM\n    &gt; To: &#39;junit@yahoogroups.com&#39;\n    &gt; Subject: [junit] separating test data from test code.\n    &gt; \n    &gt; \n    &gt; I&#39;m a QA weenie, with a coding background. I will be \n    &gt; using JUnit as a\n    &gt; framework to do API testing for an API that other \n    &gt; developers wrote. I would\n    &gt; like to keep test data separate from the test code. I \n    &gt; could see this test\n    &gt; data being read from an XML file, or quite possibly being \n    &gt; retrieved from a\n    &gt; database via JDBC, or both. \n    &gt; \n    &gt; I&#39;m wondering if there has been any discussion on this, \n    &gt; or if anyone knows\n    &gt; of any extensions that have already &quot;invented the wheel&quot; \n    &gt; in this area. I&#39;ve\n    &gt; looked at JXUnit, but it seems as if the learning curve \n    &gt; is a bit too much\n    &gt; for me to take it on right now. \n    &gt; \n    &gt; Thanks, \n    &gt; Bill Laird\n    &gt; \n    &gt; \n    &gt; BTW, if there are any yahoo groups administrators reading \n    &gt; this... please\n    &gt; take my membership status from &quot;pending&quot; to &quot;approved&quot; in \n    &gt; the yahoo\n    &gt; groups... thanks. \n    &gt; \n    &gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n    &gt; junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n    &gt;  \n    &gt; \n    &gt; Your use of Yahoo!
