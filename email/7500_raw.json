I appreciate your point of\nview and am not talking about that.  I am referring to the uneducated,\n&quot;foolish&quot; remarks he is making.  The inane remarks &quot;javainsel&quot; is making\nare the background noise, IMO.  I am addressing his approach, not the\ndebate.\n\nBTW: As far as I can tell, no one has said that DBC is competition.  In\nfact, most of the remarks have been that is quite compatible with the\nunit (programmer) testing paradigm!\n\nI apologize for the offensive remarks... I should have chosen my words\nmore delicately.\n\n=jason\n\nOn Thu, 2003-04-03 at 09:55, Thali, Nilesh wrote: Okay, can we desist\nfrom this immature mudslinging?
