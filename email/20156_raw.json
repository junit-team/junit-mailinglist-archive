I\ndon&#39;t want to test all &quot;data&quot;, I want to test a subset of all\ndata...specifically what I am going to call reference data....or meta\ndata.\n\nI want to try and be clear what I mean by reference data...or meta data.\nThis reference data or meta data is different than data that is used by\na test as a fixture...and different than transactional data that might\nbe generated.\n\nIn this application I am testing there are these tables ....I guess I\nwill call them assignment tables.  Every row...and there are many\nhundreds of rows....defines a requirement or some specific behavior. \nSuppose there are 7 columns in this table....the first 6 columns define\nsome criteria  that is matched against...and the 7th column defines some\noutcome.\n\nSo it is easy enough to write 1 JUnit test to test how this table is\nused in the functional requirement.  I know the code, specifically,\nworks as it uses this table.  But I want to know if all the data  in\nthis table is correct...because each row is really a unique requirement\nthat is implemented in data.\n\nSo I could write hundreds of tests ....one for each row of data in this\ntable....but this is obviously not the best approach.\n\nI guess my problem statement is this: the business analysts have an\nExcel spreadsheet with hundreds of rows...each row defines some unique\nrequirement on the way this particular thing is supposed to work.  Each\nrow in this spreadsheet, each requirement if you will, is not\nimplemented in code.....but in data...which I am calling reference data\nor meta data....in this table.\n\nI am fishing for thoughts on how people might go about testing this....\n\nThoughts?\n\nMike\n\nP.S.
