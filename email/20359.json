I<br/>\nhave used almost exact the same mechanism in JUnit 3.8 for making the<br/>\nparametrized test. There is one little disappoint though. Now every<br/>\nparametrized method must be in separate class that is not very good.<br/>\nEven if there is 2 [b]related[/b] tests it is impossible to use the<br/>\nsame in the single class. That is because Parameterized runner expects<br/>\nonly one constructor. So neither another parameterized, neither<br/>\nregular test can&#39;t be added. I think this should be revisited.</div>",
