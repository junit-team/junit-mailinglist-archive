There is a\nprovider for JUnit3, JUnit p=\r\nre 4.7 and JUnit post 4.7. JUnit post 4.7 uses\nthe JUnitCore, which you cou=\r\nld replace with your own version, which inserts\nthe same rule everywhere.\n\n=\r\nIt seems (at first glance) to be a better way to get global behaviour from\n=\r\nyour jenkins server.\n\nMatthew Farwell.\n\n\n2013/4/30 Henning Gro=DF &lt;igaffai@=\r\ngooglemail.com&gt;\n\n&gt; **\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi Kevin!\n&gt; Thank you very much for your feedba=\r\nck! First some words to the environment:\n&gt;\n&gt; In the project I need the feat=\r\nure we currently have 9 developers and it\n&gt; might be more. Even freelancers=\r\n. There are something around 20k tests. What\n&gt; we want to achieve is to ena=\r\nble a global timeout rule that applies\n&gt; different timeouts to tests depend=\r\ning on their category (eg SlowTests.class\n&gt; may take longer than other test=\r\ns). Also there are other things to take into\n&gt; consideration (eg is some co=\r\nntext already loaded, otherwise the timeout\n&gt; will be increased).\n&gt; This ru=\r\nle already exists and is registered in some abstract base class. Its\n&gt; work=\r\ning fine.\n&gt; Having this amount of tests makes it very hard to make sure tha=\r\nt every\n&gt; class is annotated with it. Also not all tests inherit from the a=\r\nbstract\n&gt; test class and I would like to keep it that way. It would be just=\r\n some work\n&gt; to put the rule in every test but what about tests written in =\r\nthe future.\n&gt; I need to make sure that the rule is applied to every test es=\r\npecially when\n&gt; the developer forgets about it. Its a rule that is intended=\r\n to avoid\n&gt; developers slowing down jenkins build by writing slow tests wit=\r\nhout\n&gt; annotating them as such.\n&gt;\n&gt; That said using a different runner is n=\r\not an option. Also we already have a\n&gt; hard time mixing spring-runner, mock=\r\nito-runner, junitparam-runner (btw\n&gt; we/you should copy some of that behavi=\r\nour as it is a lot more flexible than\n&gt; junit parameterized test [1])) aso-=\r\nbehaviour (btw: we/you need to think\n&gt; about the runner-concept. it would b=\r\ne a lot better to have one runner and\n&gt; registering behaviour to it (eg bei=\r\nng able to register as many &quot;runners&quot; as\n&gt; I want to).\n&gt;\n&gt; Scanning classpa=\r\nth is a good thing. We already use classpathsuite [2]. That\n&gt; enables us to=\r\n create suites without having to specify all classes in it\n&gt; (another featu=\r\nre that would very well fit junit). We could for example\n&gt; annotate a rule =\r\nwith a classifier (basepacke, package or package.classname)\n&gt; and it would =\r\nget applied to everything that matches. But this kind of\n&gt; behaviour would =\r\nintroduce a completely new way of configuration to junit (a\n&gt; little cdi/sp=\r\nring-ish). Maybe it would be a good idea to overthink the\n&gt; junit-concept l=\r\neading this direction anyway but I get the feeling its a\n&gt; little too much =\r\nfor this concern.\n&gt;\n&gt; At last I do not think the external switch is a probl=\r\nem as its highly\n&gt; optional. If you use it, you know what you are doing. Do=\r\nnt you think so?\n&gt;\n&gt; [1] https://code.google.com/p/junitparams/\n&gt; [2] http:=\r\n//johanneslink.net/projects/cpsuite.jsp\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; 2013/4/29 Kevin Cooney &lt;kcoon=\r\ney@...&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Henning,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Sorry for the lack of response. JUnit=\r\n is maintained by volunteers, and\n&gt; &gt; sometimes our day jobs get busy. I wa=\r\ns waiting for David to respond (I\n&gt; am a\n&gt; &gt; sometimes contributor) but her=\r\ne are my thoughts.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; This is an interesting idea. Note that you could=\r\n get what you want with a\n&gt; &gt; custom runner.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; My concern with adding=\r\n Rules via system properties that someone running\n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; tests in their =\r\nIDE would see different results compared to the test runs\n&gt; &gt; from Maven. S=\r\nure, you could tell your IDE to run the tests with the same\n&gt; &gt; system prop=\r\nerties, but it would be unexpected for most people to have to\n&gt; &gt; take a sp=\r\necial step to make the tests run the same way as they did in the\n&gt; &gt; contin=\r\nuous build.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Could you find some way to define the global rules via =\r\ncode? Perhaps you\n&gt; &gt; could add a DynamicRule to all of your tests that cou=\r\nld apply the\n&gt; addition\n&gt; &gt; rules. Alternatively, you could have a class in=\r\n the same package as the\n&gt; &gt; tests that defined the global rules for tests =\r\nin that package (though I&#39;m\n&gt; &gt; not sure there is a platform-independent wa=\r\ny to scan all of the classes\n&gt; in\n&gt; &gt; a package that works for all runtime/=\r\ndeployment environments)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; -- Kevin\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; On Mon, Apr 29, 2013 =\r\nat 7:09 AM, Henning Gro=DF &lt;igaffai@...\n&gt; &gt; &gt;wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; **=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Hi!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I have a use-case where I need to enable rules=\r\n based on external\n&gt; &gt; &gt; parameters.
