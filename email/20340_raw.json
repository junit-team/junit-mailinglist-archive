B. Rainsberger&quot; &lt;jbrains762@...&gt; \n&gt; Did t=\r\nhose teams reach the point where end-to-end tests took more than  \n&gt; overni=\r\nght to run? \n\nNo.  In one project they ran in about an hour. In my current =\r\nproject\nin about 30 minutes.  That includes building deployable packages fr=\r\nom\nscratch, running unit tests, dropping, recreating and upgrading the\ndata=\r\nbase, dropping and recreating queues and topics, deploying the\nserver into =\r\na production-like environment, starting the client and\nthen sending JMS mes=\r\nsages through the system and interacting with the\nclient by controlling mou=\r\nse and keyboard or getting web reports from\nthe server.\n\n30 minutes does fe=\r\nel a bit too long, but has not been a massive\nproblem so far. We have made =\r\nan effort to make the end-to-end tests\nrun faster when we find them to be s=\r\nlow as we have built up the\napplication.\n\n&gt; When that happens, I see teams =\r\nstarting to cherry- \n&gt; pick their end-to-end tests, writing only the easy o=\r\nnes that are  \n&gt; likely already to pass, and that&#39;s the point at which inte=\r\ngration  \n&gt; defects leak in by the ton.\n\nIt sounds like an education issue.=\r\n  Developers should *always* watch a\ntest fail first before implementing th=\r\ne code to make it pass.  They\nshould rarely be writing tests that can pass =\r\nfirst time and, if they\ndo, they should break the code to ensure that the t=\r\nest fails as expected.\n\nIf I found that developers were skimping on testing=\r\n I&#39;d make an effort\nto speed up the build, e.g. by running the tests in par=\r\nallel in a\nbuild grid and maybe adding more monitoring and management acces=\r\ns\npoints to the system.\n\nWe use the Team City CI server, which makes it ver=\r\ny easy to set up a\nbuild grid of multiple build machines coordinated by a s=\r\ningle server\nthat monitors the source repository.\n\nOn various projects we h=\r\nave moved scheduling out of the app itself and\nadded synchronisation messag=\r\nes and monitoring APIs so that external\ntests can get feedback on the state=\r\n of the application as fast as\npossible.  They have also turned out to be u=\r\nseful in production for\nmonitoring system state.\n\n--Nat\n\n\n",
