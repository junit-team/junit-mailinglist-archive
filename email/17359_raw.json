That example did the trick. I was able t=\r\no\nmodify it, and our team can now specify any subset of the test methods\nin=\r\n a given class dynamically as part of their development process.\n\nI would s=\r\ntrongly recommend that this trick (and any others that\nrequire extension/im=\r\nplementation from JUnit core classes) be added to\nwhatever &quot;recipes&quot; get do=\r\ncumented.\n\nI feel very strongly about the utility of JUnit (or any similar =\r\ntool)\nin a testing-dependent development environment. The only drawback I\nc=\r\nan see to using volunteer labor for documentation purposes is that\nthese vo=\r\nlunteers would need access to the brains behind the code to\nwrite complete =\r\nJavadoc. For example, in following your example, I got\ntripped up by the Re=\r\nquest filterWith() method. So many frameworks\ntoday return a modified insta=\r\nnce of the class on which you are\noperating that I was somewhat surprised t=\r\nhat the instance on which I\ncalled filterWith() was not modified.\n\nUpon ref=\r\nlection, your contract and implementation are perfectly\nreasonable OO - the=\r\n filtered instance is what is returned, not what is\ninvoked. This is the ki=\r\nnd of fine point that would be easy to miss in\ndocumenting this code as a v=\r\nolunteer. I point this out not as an\nargument against. Instead, those who v=\r\nolunteer must be cognizant of\nthe fairly subtle complexities of this framew=\r\nork, and be willing to\nask questions when contributing.\n\nOnce again, thanks=\r\n for the timely assist!\n\n--- In junit@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Kent Beck&quot; &lt;kentb@.=\r\n..&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Michael,\n&gt;  \n&gt; You&#39;re right that the JUnit documentation nee=\r\nds to be improved. As a\n&gt; volunteer project, we&#39;re open to contributions.\n&gt;=\r\n  \n&gt; The following example may serve to address the situation you raise:\n&gt; =\r\n \n&gt; public class FilterExample {\n&gt; \t@Test public void runTestsInAList() {\n&gt;=\r\n \t\tfinal String[] tests=3D new String[] {&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;};\n&gt; \t\tFilter namedTests=\r\n=3D new Filter() {\n&gt; \t\t\t@Override\n&gt; \t\t\tpublic String describe() {\n&gt; \t\t\t\tret=\r\nurn &quot;only tests starting with &#39;a&#39;&quot;;\n&gt; \t\t\t}\n&gt; \t\t\t@Override\n&gt; \t\t\tpublic boole=\r\nan shouldRun(Description description) {\n&gt; \t\t\t\tfor (String each : tests)\n&gt; \t=\r\n\t\t\t\tif\n&gt; (description.getDisplayName().startsWith(each))\n&gt; \t\t\t\t\t\treturn tru=\r\ne;\n&gt; \t\t\t\treturn false;\n&gt; \t\t\t}\n&gt; \t\t};\n&gt; \t\tRequest request=3D\n&gt; Request.aClas=\r\ns(Tests.class).filterWith(namedTests);\n&gt; \t\tResult result=3D new JUnitCore()=\r\n.run(request);\n&gt; \t\tassertEquals(2, result.getRunCount());\n&gt; \t}\n&gt; \tpublic st=\r\natic class Tests {\n&gt; \t\t@Test public void a() {}\n&gt; \t\t@Test public void b() {=\r\n}\n&gt; \t\t@Test public void c() {}\n&gt; \t}\n&gt; }\n&gt; \n&gt; Sincerely yours,\n&gt; \n&gt; Kent Bec=\r\nk\n&gt; Three Rivers Institute\n&gt; \n&gt; ________________________________\n&gt; \n&gt; \tFrom=\r\n: junit@yahoogroups.com [mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com] On Behalf\n&gt; Of Micha=\r\nel Schechter\n&gt; \tSent: Monday, August 07, 2006 8:11 AM\n&gt; \tTo: junit@yahoogro=\r\nups.com\n&gt; \tSubject: [junit] How to add functionality for execution flexibil=\r\nty?\n&gt; \t\n&gt; \t\n&gt; \n&gt; \tI am looking to add the following functionality to my tes=\r\nts:\n&gt; \t- When provided a list of method names on the command line, only\n&gt; t=\r\nhose\n&gt; \tmethods in the invoked class will be executed.\n&gt; \t\n&gt; \tI need this i=\r\nmplementation at the test class level. This was pretty\n&gt; \tstraightforward w=\r\nith JUnit 3.8.1 - just create new instances of the\n&gt; \tderived TestCase with=\r\n the method name as the argument, and add them\n&gt; to\n&gt; \tthe suite.\n&gt; \t\n&gt; \tI =\r\nam having a lot of difficulty trying to replicate this\n&gt; \tfunctionality. Th=\r\ne filter logic appears to be a one-shot exclusion\n&gt; \tfilter (everything not=\r\n matching is dropped), and I can&#39;t seem to\n&gt; find\n&gt; \tany documentation that=\r\n would address this.\n&gt; \t\n&gt; \tAs Mr. Rainsberger and others have suggested, I=\r\n have searched the\n&gt; web\n&gt; \tfor an appropriate tutorial. I have found a num=\r\nber of good basic\n&gt; \ttutorials (including some references in this group), a=\r\nnd a couple\n&gt; with\n&gt; \tsome advanced content. I cannot seem to find one with=\r\n the detail to\n&gt; \tunlock the tools and capabilities that I am positive are =\r\navailable\n&gt; \twithin the new JUnit framework. \n&gt; \t\n&gt; \tI am also convinced th=\r\nat no one is as capable as the authors in\n&gt; \tdocumenting the features of th=\r\ne framework, and I am having trouble\n&gt; \tfind Javadoc for some of the classe=\r\ns and APIs in the JUnit 4.1 tree.\n&gt; \tThere is a fairly good chance that I a=\r\nm looking in the wrong place.\n&gt; \t\n&gt; \tIf anyone has any suggestions or guida=\r\nnce on these issues, it would\n&gt; be\n&gt; \tgreatly appreciated.\n&gt; \t\n&gt; \tThanks in=\r\n advance!\n&gt; \t\n&gt; \tMichael Schechter\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n",
