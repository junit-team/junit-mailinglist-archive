Easy automation.\n2. We write test cases that are not Runner dependent.\n3. We can run several tests with at max 3 mouse clicks or run a suite of\ntests by simply right clicking the suite.\n4. We can change the Runner on the fly without having to re-export the class\nfiles by modifying our loader code in the workspace.  \n\nThat is what the tools api is for, why not use it?  This is not the place\n(probably) to get into a heated discussion of the uses of VAJ, however.  So,\nif you would like some more feedback on how we use it, email me directly. :)\n\n-Jason\n[mailto:jason.rogers@...]\n\n    &gt; -----Original Message-----\n    &gt; From: rainsber@...

Basically, \n    &gt; there are two ways to\n    &gt; accomplish running anything from tools.\n    &gt; \n    &gt; 1. export .class files out to directory where the \n    &gt; default.ini is, have the\n    &gt; default.ini refer to them as normal\n    &gt; 2. don&#39;t export .class files out to directory where the \n    &gt; default.ini is,\n    &gt; have\n    &gt; the default.ini refer to them as normal\n    &gt; \n    &gt; Simple?  If you do #2, which I recommend, the added step \n    &gt; is to put any\n    &gt; project you need in the workspace classpath (by default, \n    &gt; we put every\n    &gt; project in there - but that&#39;s overkill).  You also need \n    &gt; to make sure that\n    &gt; you have the referenced project that you want to access \n    &gt; in your workspace\n    &gt; (I\n    &gt; know that sounds obvious, but just in case...).  In \n    &gt; addition it is good to\n    &gt; have the VAJ Tools API projects in your workspace (and \n    &gt; include them in the\n    &gt; workspace classpath).\n    &gt; \n    &gt; How is your default.ini file constructed?\n    &gt; \n    &gt; -Jason\n    &gt; \n    &gt; \n    &gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n    &gt; junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n    &gt; \n    &gt; \n    &gt; Your use of Yahoo!
