Obtain the test method execution time which EXCLUDES setup and teardown time.<br/>\n2. Facilitate warm runs for the method. Run the same method more than once. B<br/>\n    (I dont have a problem in getting the iterations from a configuration file)<br/>\n(Warm tests are facilitated as jvm takes sometime to load the class for the very first run)<br/>\nI have achieved this by modifying the junit source code. Which I dont think is the best way, as and when a new version of junit come in... I should be spending time to identify the instrumentaiton points and modify it. Which is not feasible.<br/>\nI want to decouple my code from Junit&#39;s and still should be able to achive my objectives.<br/>\nCould anyone suggest a better way to achieve this..?<br/>\nThanks<br/>\nShubha<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      Best Jokes, Best Friends, Best Food and more.
