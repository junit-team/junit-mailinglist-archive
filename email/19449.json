Does anyone have any<br/>\nfirst hand knowledge they can share?<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d like a course that can focus on the benefits of unit testing, how<br/>\nto use mocks, how to harness the power of TDD, how to sniff out code<br/>\nsmells that unit testing exposes (and what to do about it).<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks-<br/>\nZak</div>",
