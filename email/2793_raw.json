We (the Apache\n&gt; &gt; Avalon project) use Ant to do our builds and automated testing,\n&gt; &gt; however the behavior for test collection is different based\n&gt; &gt; on wether a Test is a TestCase or a TestSuite.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Your FAQ suggests that for one-time setup code you need to run\n&gt; &gt; it in a TestSuite.\n&gt; \n&gt; This is what TestSetup is for. Wrap the suite in a subclass of\n&gt; TestSetup, override setUp() (and maybe tearDown()) in your subclass,\n&gt; and it only gets run once.\n&gt; \n&gt; Alternatively, you could consider how to untangle your design so you\n&gt; didn&#39;t need one-time setup.\n\nI don&#39;t _need_ one-time setup, it is a matter of resources.  We have\na rather expensive setup and tear down routine that takes time.  If\nit were done once for all the tests in the class then the test takes\nan order of magnitude less time to run.\n\nAlso, some tests do need one time setup, the idea was to allow them\nto extend one of our own framework interfaces (Initializable or\nDisposable) to do their own one time setup.\n\nThe solution we have still allows the use of setUp() and tearDown()\nfor each test (prepare files, etc).\n\nI can try the TestSetup -- it is probably easier to maintain.\n\nThe whole thing is that I don&#39;t want to have to set up suites specifically\nfor the purpose of wrapping them.\n\n",
