Test everything that could possibly not work.\n&gt; 2. Test everything that you fear does not work.\n\nThe flip side of that is that if your are practicing TDD it&#39;s never an\nissue... if there is code, it&#39;s only there because there was a test\nthat required it.. so there&#39;s never any question... you nevere have to\nask &quot;Must I text X&quot;... but you ask &quot;How do I test X&quot;.. where X is some\nbehaviour.. not some method... so things like setters are not\n(typically) behaviour.. they&#39;re implementation details.\n\nDave\n\n\n\n",
