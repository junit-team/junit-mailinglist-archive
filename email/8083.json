I was approaching it from a more general<br/>\nperspective.  I wasn&#39;t even assuming Java.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Hmm, in this I guess I&#39;m assuming that this thing&#39;s state is easy to<br/>\n&gt; examine after deserializing.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I would think that an assertEquals test should be adequate.  Maybe<br/>\neven an assertSame test if there is caching involved.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; If that&#39;s not the case for some reason, then I think you&#39;d also want<br/>\n&gt; to think about why that&#39;s the case before just going with examining <br/>\n&gt; serialization files.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Agreed.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; Yes.  Agreed.  But try to avoid using a file to do it.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Definitely.  Another poster (was it you, Dave?)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I believe so.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; suggested that String streams are the way to go, and I agree with <br/>\n&gt; that.  If you need to share these things between tests, make them <br/>\n&gt; fixtures and share them that way.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yes.  But all you can share is the initial state... there should be no<br/>\neffects from one test on another.<br/>\n<br/>\nDave</div>",
