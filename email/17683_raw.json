B. Rainsberger wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;I find it difficult not to interpret this as a (very mild) personal \n&gt;&gt;attack. You seem to imply that we are not also practitioners. I suspect \n&gt;&gt;you&#39;re not an asshole, so I imagine you mean something else. I would \n&gt;&gt;appreciate you clarifying this position. Is it necessarily the case, \n&gt;&gt;then, that &quot;the sort of programmers who... hang out on lists like this \n&gt;&gt;one&quot; don&#39;t know what we&#39;re talking about, because I kinda think I do and \n&gt;&gt;I kinda think I&#39;ve proven that.\n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;You do know what you&#39;re talking about, and you are practitioners, as am \n&gt;I. However you&#39;re making the classic mistake of assuming that everyone \n&gt;else is just like you, and that what works for you works for them. This \n&gt;is a *HUGE* and unrecognized fallacy that underlies a lot more than \n&gt;programming methodologies. For instance, it&#39;s largely responsible for \n&gt;the failure of modern elementary and secondary education, which works \n&gt;for maybe 5% of children. However that&#39;s those 5% that go onto become \n&gt;teachers and principles and propagate the same techniques to future \n&gt;generations, while ignoring the failure of 95% of their students.\n&gt;\n&gt;The simple fact is that people learn and think differently. No one \n&gt;technique works for everyone, but some techniques do work for more \n&gt;people. We tend to self-select into groups that think similarly and \n&gt;learn similarly to ourselves. The people who like interfaces are a \n&gt;self-selected group of programmers who think at a very high degree of \n&gt;abstraction, even for programmers (already a self-selected and abstract \n&gt;bunch). This doesn&#39;t mean they don&#39;t produce quality software. It does \n&gt;mean that you can&#39;t expect what works for them to work for all or even \n&gt;most developers.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nI think you&#39;re mixing pedagogical techniques with working techniques.  \nAverage programmers can think in terms of interfaces.. it&#39;s a matter of \nacclimation.  Note, I&#39;m talking about average programmers.  There are, \nunfortunately, some people who really shouldn&#39;t be programming at all.\n\nI know that there are cases where you know that the people who come \nafter you in a project are going to be of uncertain caliber.  I was \ntalking to a friend a month ago who was part of a small team that \ndeliberately didn&#39;t use patterns.   They programmed for the least common \ndenominator because that was all that they could count on for \nmaintenance.  They made a calculated bet.  The thing is, though, that \nI&#39;ve seen enough teams raise their level of practice to bet on that when \nI know that they have the opportunity.\n\nMichael Feathers\nwww.objectmentor.com\n\n\n\n\n",
