This is because our =\r\nautomated build uses it; if I was able to get parallel test-methods it&#39;d cu=\r\nt the run-time of our long-running builds to about a third. If I could get =\r\nclasses too I&#39;d probably aim for world-record swamping of our 16-core build=\r\n server ;) Reducing wall-clock execution time of all our builds is a priori=\r\nty concern.\n\nFor our daily work we use IntelliJ idea v8, and while certainl=\r\ny &quot;nice to have&quot; the value of parallel tests in the development environment=\r\n is less glaringly obvious. \n\nI was looking around in the git-snapshot of j=\r\nunit-4.7 code, trying to determine how/if I could do this. It seems to me l=\r\nike there&#39;s two basic approaches as to how to achieve this:\n\nTo get paralle=\r\nlization for classes you need to mess around with the runner. I&#39;m not total=\r\nly familiar/comfortable with how this would be done. \n\nFor parallel methods=\r\n it seems like one *should* be able to specify a &quot;Computer&quot; on the &quot;@RunWit=\r\nh&quot; annotation; it even seems like a logical configuration point for this in=\r\nformation. \n\nI know this may be slightly off-topic, but I feel several &quot;ten=\r\nsions&quot; in the code-base around the &quot;Computer&quot;. Is this still largely work i=\r\nn progress?\n\nKristian\n\n\n\n\n\n\n--- In junit@yahoogroups.com, David Saff &lt;david=\r\n@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Kristian,\n&gt; \n&gt; 1) Can you use the 4.7 snapshot?\n&gt; 2) Are y=\r\nou trying to parallelize methods within a class, classes\n&gt; within a suite, =\r\nor both?\n&gt; 3) What are you using to run the tests?\n&gt; \n&gt;    David Saff\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\nOn Thu, Jun 18, 2009 at 6:07 AM, krosenvold&lt;kristian@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Using =\r\na RunnerBuilder and a Computer, the JUNIT 4.7 Request class creates the Run=\r\nner object.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I am currently using @RunWith(SpringJUnit4ClassRunner.c=\r\nlass) (from spring 3.0 rc) and I&#39;m trying to shoehorn parallel running into=\r\n this regime, but it seems to me like these two designs are now fairly orth=\r\nogonal.
