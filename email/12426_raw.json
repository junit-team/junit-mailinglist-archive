We understand. That&#39;s why we are \nbringing the successful &quot;XP Day&quot; concept to North America, starting in \nToronto, Ontario, Canada.\n\nXP Day is a one-day event especially for those who want to get started \nlearning about Extreme Programming from the best minds in the community. \nIt has a little something for everyone, whether you&#39;re:\n\n     * An executive wondering how XP can improve the contribution your \nsoftware organization makes to the bottom line,\n     * A manager looking for ways to increase your team&#39;s effectiveness,\n     * A skeptic, hoping to challenge the most experienced and outspoken \nXP practitioners,\n     * A programmer itching to experience a real XP project room,\n     * An experienced practitioner, hoping to share ideas with other \nexperienced practitioners\n\nAlthough the tutorials are aimed at beginners, Open Space plays a major \nrole in this event, giving XPerienced people an opportunity to come \ntogether for a day and share their ideas without the limitations of \ne-mail. This group, being identified as a gathering place for XP \npractitioners, will receive a separate invitation to the Open Space \nportion of the event. We certainly hope you&#39;ll join us!\n-- \nJ.
