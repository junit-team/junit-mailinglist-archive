I&#39;ve known\nmany people who have gotten ramped up with Eclipse and JUnit without a\nlot of pain, microkernels or no.  Can you share one particular problem\nyou&#39;ve had?\n\n   David Saff\n\nOn Tue, Oct 7, 2008 at 12:11 PM, John van V. &lt;john.van.v@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; wennnnke wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; I think the book &quot;Test-Driven Development by Example&quot; is a good start\n&gt; point.\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks, I think I should add that the most successful administration\n&gt; that I did was all based on &quot;images.&quot; I say images because I cannot\n&gt; think of a better word.\n&gt;\n&gt; The GNU crowd was insisting on source code distribution, and then Red\n&gt; Hat and Debian implemented binary &quot;package&quot; manager tools, but I found\n&gt; that simply creating an independent application directory (/opt had\n&gt; just been embraced) and writing to it (using tar and ssh) would\n&gt; install instantly a fully configured application, that would include\n&gt; all the necessary libraries, especially those that might clash with\n&gt; system-distributed libraries.\n&gt;\n&gt; This would provide a fully operational (and hardened) application\n&gt; (usually server) distribution, and of course would run completely\n&gt; against the Windows methodology of using a &quot;registry,&quot; which\n&gt; apparently defeats this kind of distribution.\n&gt;\n&gt; In terms of Eclipse, it would be nice to have fully configured\n&gt; sub-sections, such as JUnit, that are known to run on a specific\n&gt; Eclipse install so that newbies could have a running start, rather\n&gt; than having to suffer weeks of thrashing around such as I have just\n&gt; experienced.\n&gt;\n&gt; The Java &quot;culture&quot; it seems goes beyond the Windows in making\n&gt; something simple like this impossible, and the Eclipse &quot;culture&quot;\n&gt; openly states that their application is not tested on the latest Java\n&gt; VMs. Paraphrasing, &quot;your application may or may not work.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; I have strong interest in microkernels that follow the patterns of\n&gt; LibOS, and I strongly support the idea of an image library as a\n&gt; working repository for versions of L4. If you are curious, my ThinMan\n&gt; idea grew out of a desire to see gaming stations become regular\n&gt; workstations, and evolved into the idea of a fully distributed network\n&gt; with few if any centralized servers, except perhaps support servers\n&gt; and legacy e-commerce machines.\n&gt;\n&gt; http://thinman.com\n&gt; \n\n",
