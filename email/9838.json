This is why we are looking for a good obfuscator. I have no experience with obfuscators but my boss has ordered me to get a good one, no matter whether it is commercial or not.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease let me know what obfuscators you use and what about the experience with them.<br/>\n<br/>\nI look forward to hearing from you.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -----Mensaje original-----<br/>\n&gt; De:\tChad Woolley [SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lists@...\">lists@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Enviado el:\tmartes, 11 de noviembre de 2003 10:57<br/>\n&gt; Para:\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Asunto:\tRe: [junit] Digest Number 1040<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Nathan Coast wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Hi,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Is anyone doing performance testing with junit or a junit extension?  I&#39;ve <br/>\n&gt; &gt; looked at JUnitPerf and I don&#39;t think it has the functionality I need.  I&#39;d like <br/>\n&gt; &gt; to record the time taken to execute individual junit tests.  The idea is that it <br/>\n&gt; &gt; should then be possible identify when code changes occurred that caused a <br/>\n&gt; &gt; significant drop in performance.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; thanks<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Nathan<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; You could probably do this if you wrote a custom TestRunner.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; If you know Aspect-Oriented Programming, this also seems like a good use for it. <br/>\n&gt;   It would be fairly simple to write an aspect which reported elapsed execution <br/>\n&gt; time on a per-test-method level.  You could write the data on all tests for each <br/>\n&gt; run to a CSV file, for example.  Then you could use a spreadsheet or other tool <br/>\n&gt; to perform trend analysis on the collected data over time.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\">junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
