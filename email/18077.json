By the time I arrived<br/>\n&gt; &gt; SourceSafe (better than nothing) and Ant were both in use, if only just.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I am not a Microsoft basher any more, but I still believe that <br/>\n&gt; SourceSafe is actually /worse/ than no version control. I feel similarly <br/>\n&gt; about ClearCase, although not as strongly.<br/>\n&gt; -- <br/>\n&gt; J. B.

I would prefer almost anything else but not nothing. At<br/>\nleast there is a plugin for Eclipse and you can do simple versioning and<br/>\nlabeling, even if SourceSafe&#39;s branch and merge capability is effectively<br/>\nnon-existent (something I&#39;m twitching about at the moment :-( ).<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve used ClearCase before as well (with WSAD) and it was reasonable, if a<br/>\nlittle clunky in use.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve heard good things about subversion but I&#39;ve never had a chance to use<br/>\nit.<br/>\n<br/>\nMichael Rutherfurd<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n**************   IMPORTANT MESSAGE  **************<br/>\nThis e-mail message is intended only for the addressee(s) and contains information which may be confidential. <br/>\nIf you are not the intended recipient please advise the sender by return email, do not use or disclose the contents, and delete the message and any attachments from your system.
