As a matt=\r\ner\nof fact, we brought Kent Beck on board as an Agitar Fellow a couple of\ny=\r\nears ago.  I also gave 2 JavaOne presentation on JUnit (not\nAgitator); one =\r\nin 2004 and the last one just last week where I\nco-presented with Kent Beck=\r\n himself.  Agitator takes full advantage of\nany existing JUnit tests and ou=\r\nr Dashboard product is also fully\nintegrated with JUnit.\n\nSo, don&#39;t think i=\r\nn terms of JUnit vs. Agitator, but in terms of what\ncan Agitator do to comp=\r\nlement my JUnit and TDD efforts.  Of course, I\nbelieve it can do a lot - bu=\r\nt I am hardly an impartial party :-).\n\nJUnit is great for TDD which, as som=\r\ne people noted, is more about\ndesign than testing.  It&#39;s also great for cra=\r\nfting very specific test\ncases where you can use your intuition and underst=\r\nanding of the domain\nspace and implementation to cover interesting scenario=\r\ns and sequences.\n\nAgitator is great for exploratory testing, subjecting you=\r\nr code to all\nsorts of inputs - both valid and invalid - which helps you th=\r\nink about\ncorner cases and conditions that you might have overlooked. It&#39;s =\r\nalso\nuniquely capable in discovering and enforcing class and method\ninvaria=\r\nnts (i.e. properties of the code that should *always* be true -\nas opposed =\r\nto the more specific cases people typically write in JUnit).\n\nBottom line: =\r\n Think in terms of JUnit + Agitator and not JUnit vs.\nAgitator.\n\nThanks,\n\nA=\r\nlberto Savoia\n\n\n\n\n--- In junit@yahoogroups.com, &quot;davek725&quot; &lt;david.kissinger=\r\n@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; My company is currently doing TDD and using JUnit for our =\r\nunit \n&gt; testing - both persistence testing and business logic testing.  We =\r\n\n&gt; are now looking at Agitator and trying to determine if, and how, it \n&gt; f=\r\nits into our current practices.  I was wondering how others have \n&gt; decided=\r\n to use Agitator (or not use it).  Some of the issues we are \n&gt; struggling =\r\nwith:\n&gt; \n&gt; 1.  Agitator looks like it can eliminate the need to write most =\r\nJUnit \n&gt; tests (except true persistence testing).  The downside is that we =\r\n\n&gt; would be left with only Agitator config files that contain our \n&gt; busine=\r\nss logic assertions.  This seems like a big leap to take, given \n&gt; that if =\r\nAgitar goes away, we have no JUnit.\n&gt; \n&gt; 2.  Agitator mocks and factories l=\r\nook easy to create, but look like \n&gt; they are only useful in the context of=\r\n Agitator.  I couldn&#39;t use them \n&gt; for other purposes (e.g. Fitnesse, JUnit=\r\n).\n&gt; \n&gt; 3.  Having my business logic tests in JUnit means they are in an \n&gt;=\r\n understood format and things such as inputs and expected results are \n&gt; cl=\r\nearly visible and grouped with each test.  My impression of \n&gt; Agitator is =\r\nthat this wouldn&#39;t be as clear.\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
