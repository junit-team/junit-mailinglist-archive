When I asked for &quot;more modern license&quot; I did not know how close I was. Proliferation of various open source licenses is bad and I am glad upgrading to EPL1.0 is allowed by CPL1.0. It can safe a lot of troubles.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, when it is clear that EPL1.0 is the natural evolution step, I can offer some help. Kent mentioned that he has no capacity to change the license himself. I can help changing all the JUnit sources and create a patch. The rest would be just a matter of incorporating my changes into main source line and releasing binaries for under the new license...<br/>\n<br/>\nShall we walk this path?<br/>\n-jt<br/>\n<br/>\n[1] The license would rather be called CPL1.1 if &quot;the superceeding&quot; was the plan from begining...<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;milestravisparker&quot; &lt;milesparker@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The following posts might be helpful..<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://dev.eclipse.org/blogs/mike/2009/04/16/one-small-step-towards-reducing-license-proliferation/\">http://dev.eclipse.org/blogs/mike/2009/04/16/one-small-step-towards-reducing-license-proliferation/</a><br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://forums.pentaho.com/showthread.php?69944-License-upgrade-from-CPL-to-EPL\">http://forums.pentaho.com/showthread.php?69944-License-upgrade-from-CPL-to-EPL</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; IANAL either but the section 7 language does appear to give any contributor the right to release under a successor license, and EPL is a successor.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Hope you guys can get it sorted out!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a>, Kent Beck &lt;kentb@&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Dear Jaroslav,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Thank you for the message. It is not practical to change the license for JUnit because of the difficult of identifying and notifying contributors. Commercial licenses are available and have been sold through Three Rivers Consulting, Inc. with terms crafted to meet your needs. Please have your lawyers contact me for details.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>",
