Quite=\r\n a lot of bugs come from typos, or little\nmistakes in xml files.\nAnd using =\r\na DTD doesn&#39;t completely address the problem.\nFor example we have Hibernate=\r\n hbm mapping files.\nThere&#39;s a lot of reflection configuration there, and no=\r\n dtd will check that.\n\nMy concrete problem is that I want to test hibernate=\r\n configuration.\nI have two ideas on how to do this:\n\n1. Use dbunit, hsqldb =\r\nto make some basic operations over my\npersistent classes. This way I&#39;m pret=\r\nty sure they are correctly mapped.\n2. I somehow manage to test the configur=\r\nation files.\n\nI&#39;ve already tried the first one, but it seems to me like a l=\r\not of\nwork, and It feels like testing two things: hibernate and my config\nf=\r\niles when I only want to test the files.\n\nTherefore, I want to follow the s=\r\necond approach because it looks more\naccuratet to me; but I don&#39;t know how,=\r\n or if there is something out\nthere that does that job for me (It looks lik=\r\ne a common problem).\n\nMaybe I&#39;m wrong, and the common thing is not testing =\r\nthe config files,\nbecause integration tests will do that for me. Is this tr=\r\nue?!\n\nWell, any link or google searchphrase will be appreciated.. :D\n\nThank=\r\ns in advance,\nMariano Cortesi\n\n",
