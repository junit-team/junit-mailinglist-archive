Is there a way to get\naround this issue? More specifically; is it possible to execute all\nassertions in a test function despite some have failed.\n\nI attempted using JFunc, but it is slightly incomplete. Other than\nthis extension, I have had little luck finding anything else.\n\nCheers!\n-Raffie-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
