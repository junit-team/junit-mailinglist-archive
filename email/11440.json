If there aren&#39;t many fixes that needed to be integrated, how much<br/>\nof a problem is it?<br/>\n<br/>\nPersonally, I am using JUnit for years now, both in private and big<br/>\ncommercial projects, and since 3.8.1 I never felt that it needed fixing.<br/>\nMight have something to do with the fact that I use the Eclipse<br/>\nintegration instead of the Swing Testrunner, of course...<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; Ant is also huge and complicated, compared to JUnit.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; And has more uses.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>More uses than core Junit, certainly. More uses than Junit + all the<br/>\navailable extensions, I am not so sure about...<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; And yet, I have no more wrapper code for Ant than<br/>\n&gt; I have for JUnit.

The &quot;slowness&quot; might<br/>\nwell have prevented it to become bloated with all kinds of shiny<br/>\nfeatures which now instead are available as seperate extensions...<br/>\n<br/>\nNo hard feelings, Ilja</div>",
