(it has to be humble after following an answer<br/>\nfrom Kent :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nI had previously had this idea to write an ebook about JUnit and started it<br/>\nand in it&#39;s incomplete glory it lives on Github at the following project<br/>\nURL:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://github.com/simonpeter/Testanomicon\">http://github.com/simonpeter/Testanomicon</a><br/>\n<br/>\nGo to the project page and scroll down, near the bottom are two choices of<br/>\nPDF, an ebook size or US letter size. There are five chapters at this point,<br/>\nwith the fifth one being a description of thinking through a requirement to<br/>\ncome up with both tests and code. I&#39;m actually back re-writing the fifth<br/>\nchapter right now as I am not really satisfied with it. So, take it as you<br/>\nfind it and if it works for you that&#39;s wonderful. I&#39;ll announce when I have<br/>\nany new updates.<br/>\n<br/>\nSimon<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Mon, May 17, 2010 at 2:37 PM, Kent Beck &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kentb@...\">kentb@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; I am recording a series of screencasts on TDD for the Pragmatic<br/>\n&gt; Programmers.

I started searching for best<br/>\n&gt; practices and found that people were asking that question all the way back<br/>\n&gt; in 2001! Kind of intimidating!<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Anyway, what I am looking for is not &quot;best practices&quot;, per se, but a real<br/>\n&gt; world example. And from that I mean an example that starts from an idea in<br/>\n&gt; someone&#39;s head and evolves all the way through application completion and<br/>\n&gt; testing coverage. For example, I am thinking of an auto insurance type of<br/>\n&gt; application that has certain requirements, say 10, and how the tests are<br/>\n&gt; derived from the requirements and the code gets derived from the tests.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; We have many developers that are new to Test Driven Development, and to<br/>\n&gt; simply come out with best practices and ask them to get on board will never<br/>\n&gt; work. However, if we can take a real world example, from start to finish,<br/>\n&gt; and show how the tests did drive the code and how refactoring became so much<br/>\n&gt; simpler as a result, that would be a great start into changing the mentality<br/>\n&gt; of some of our developers (myself included ;-)<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Any suggestions?<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Thank you,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Regards,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Elaine<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Yahoo!
