By posting \nthis email I am hoping to receive additional guidance and insight \nfrom the JUnit community.  Please copy any responses to \njcarpenter@....\n______________________________________________________\nWe are finding that there are times when it may be desirable to check \ninto source control code that is not fully implemented.  The tests \nmay be defined, but the corresponding class implementation may not be \ncomplete.\n\nPerl&#39;s standard framework has the concept of a todo test.  A simple \nenough way to notate such a test in JUnit would be to name a method \nwithin a test todoBlah, rather than testBlah.  To safely go down this \nroad, it is desirable to extend JUnit to report on what todo tests \nare in the code base in addition to the normal tests.  I am \nconsidering writting such an extension and contributing it back to \nthe JUnit project.  Unfortuantely, I don&#39;t know where in the JUnit \ncode base to start.\n\nCan you provide guidance as to what classes would need to be changed \nto support this functionality?  Do you have any suggestions\nto improve the idea?  Ideally this can fit into JUnit&#39;s normal \nextension framework.\n\nThank you for your time and consideration.\n\nJimmy Carpenter\njcarpenter@...\n__________________________________________\nErik Meade kindly responded with the following:\n*******************\nJimmy,\n\nI think the class you want to start with is junit.framework.TestSuite.\nTake a look at the constructor which accepts a Class.  I believe this\nis where the tests get loaded by reflection...\n\nIf you want more input I would suggest you post this to the JUnit \ngroup,\nwhich you can sign up with from the junit.org page, and/or a forum on\nhttp://sourceforge.net/projects/junit/\n\n--\nErik Meade             emeade@...\nSenior Consultant      Object Mentor, Inc.\nhttp://www.junit.org \n\n\n\n\n",
