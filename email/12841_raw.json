If there are no effects, then\nwhy do you have the method? To use your example: what is the secondary\neffect of setting the private fields? The primary effect will be that\nthe private fields get new values. That these values are not available\nwith getters is not necessarily a problem. If the new values in the\nfields have secondary effects, then measure those. Ask yourself why\nyou are setting these private fields and then test the thing that they\ndo affect.\n\nLet&#39;s make up a contrived example. Perhaps in a sales system, you can\ngenerate quotes with different customer discounts. Let&#39;s pretend that\nthe discount is our &quot;set only&quot; field. So we can set it&#39;s value but not\ninspect it. Fine. The reason that we have the field is to calculate\ndiscounts on quotes. So, to test it, set a sale price of $100, set the\ndiscount at 10% and check that the quote gives you an answer of $90.\nThe affect on the quoted price is the secondary effect. If there is no\nsecondary effect of the method, then I strongly suggest that it needs\nvery close examination. :-)\n\n&gt; 2) Methods that work on network traffic, ex counting all TCP packets\n&gt; that I receive. I would need an isolated environment and would need to\n&gt; be able to send X amount of packets to my machine.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks in advance\n&gt; Pico\n\nHope this helps.\n\nSimon\n(the Lands&#39; End guy who recently switched to GMail :-)\n\n\n\n\n",
