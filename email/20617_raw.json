This was a battle of conversions.  By taking\nadvantage of auto-boxing, we lost the advantage of automatic widening.\n While trying to simulate widening after auto-boxing, I did something\ndumb.  Thanks to Eclipse, the dumb decision was immortalized for over\na year.  Summary:\n\nassertEquals(1, 1L)\n4.2: false\n4.3: true\n4.4: true\n\nassertEquals(1.2, 1.3)\n4.2: false\n4.3: true\n4.4: exception thrown: use three-argument version\n\n   David Saff\n\nOn Mon, Jun 23, 2008 at 5:03 PM, David Saff &lt;david@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; On Tue, Jun 3, 2008 at 11:41 PM, Nattapong Sirilappanich\n&gt; &lt;natta@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Hi,\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; When i try to make an assertion on Number object, e.g. Double the result\n&gt;&gt; always assertion successful.\n&gt;&gt; Even i try to compare by org.junit.Assert.assertEquals(123456789.345,\n&gt;&gt; 123456789.34), it still success.

My last five attempts to\n&gt; mail the list have failed.\n&gt;\n&gt; JUnit 4.3 has a bug.  1.2 should never equal 1.3.  Eclipse 3.3 shipped\n&gt; with JUnit 4.3, which is why this bug has had such a long lifespan.\n&gt; You can upgrade to JUnit 4.4, wait for Eclipse 3.4, or use\n&gt; assertEquals(double, double, double) directly.\n&gt;\n&gt;   David Saff\n&gt;\n\n",
