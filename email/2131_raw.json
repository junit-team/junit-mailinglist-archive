So instead we choose\nto use a number and put a comment before the test method to describe\nwhat is being tested.  The numbers actually enable you easily to know\nhow many test methods you have for a specific method.\n\nAs a correction, we are actually putting the numbers at the end of\nthe test method name:\n\n    test_nameOfMethodBeingTested_##\n\nI agree that this system is only descriptive up to a point in telling\nyou the name of the method being tested.  If someone has a better\nsuggestion please reply.\n\nThe basic question is, &quot;When you have multiple test methods that test\na single method, what naming convention do you use for the test\nmethods?&quot;\n\n\n--- Jim Cheesman &lt;jchees@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;I use the following naming convention for my test methods to keep\n&gt; &gt;things organized:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;     test_##_nameOfMethodBeingTested\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;For example, the eigth test method for the method\n&gt; isAccountAssigned\n&gt; &gt;would be,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;     test_07_isAccountAssigned\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Doesn&#39;t this rather make your testing order dependent, which I\n&gt; believe \n&gt; cannot be guaranteed with JUnit? Why add the number if not?\n&gt; Shouldn&#39;t test \n&gt; cases have names that reflect their purpose (a la Refactoring) just\n&gt; as much \n&gt; as production code? This numbering rather defeats that... And if,\n&gt; say, test \n&gt; 07 fails - what does that tell me? That 01-06 and 08-12 have\n&gt; passed, \n&gt; and...???\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --\n&gt; \n&gt;                            *   Jim Cheesman   *\n&gt;              Trabajo: \n&gt; jchees@... - (34)(91) 724 9200 x 2360\n&gt; Reality is a big, nasty, vicious \n&gt; dragon, but I don&#39;t believe in dragons.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nMake international calls for as low as $.04/minute with Yahoo!
