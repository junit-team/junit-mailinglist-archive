If you have 10 situations for one scenario, you must write test for 10+ test cases for each situation not only do only 1 for whole problem.TDD is useful if you do exactly what it requests.\n\nCheers,\nHai\nhttp://www.haiphucnguyen.net/blog/\n\nIlja Preuss &lt;it@...&gt; wrote:                               hyysguyang wrote:\n &gt; In my opinion about the requirement,I think I should not reverse any \n &gt; other sentence but \n &gt; the &#39;TDD is a software devolopment technology&#39;,so I needn&#39;t write so \n &gt; many test but the test below\n &gt; \n &gt; @Test  public void testReverse(){   \n &gt;            StringReverser sr=new StringReverser();   \n &gt;            String str = &quot;Tdd is a software devolopment \n &gt; technology&quot;;   \n &gt;            Assert.assertEquals(&quot;technology devolopment software a is \n &gt; Tdd&quot;,sr.reverse(str));   \n &gt;        } \n &gt; after this I refactor to the final code described befoe.Maybe I make \n &gt; a large jump.\n \n If this is the only requirement, your final code was more complex then \n needed.
