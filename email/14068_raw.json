For example, you might measure that\n&gt; the total memory used by a list and all its members were\n&gt; less than 100K. [...]\n\nAt last year&#39;s JavaOne conference I ran across the &quot;Insane&quot; tool, a \nremarkably simple and small set of classes used by the NetBeans team \nto measure memory usage and detect memory leaks.  It can also \nestimate the size of object trees.\n\nSee:\nhttp://performance.netbeans.org/insane/\n\nBriefly, it uses reflection to find all the classes the system \nClassLoader has loaded, and follows the static fields to all \ninstances referenced by them.  And you can give it stack-based \nreferences to improve coverage.  It&#39;s a very nifty trick.\n\n\n\n",
