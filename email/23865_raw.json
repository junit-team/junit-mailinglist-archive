I do not =\r\nsay\nit is evil (like kicking small puppies), just be careful with it. :)  S=\r\nuch\napproach steers you towards testing of class methods, which is fine, bu=\r\nt\ntesting of class responsibilities is what you goal should really be! The\n=\r\ndifference is (sometimes) subtle, but important in the long run.\n\nP.S. Howe=\r\nver, if you are starting (or renewing) your friendship with JUnit,\nthen it =\r\nmight be a good start.\n\n-- \nRegards / Pozdrawiam\nTomek Kaczanowski\nhttp://p=\r\nracticalunittesting.com\n\nW dniu 26 kwietnia 2012 22:13 u=BFytkownik Michael=\r\n &lt;mfeher00@...&gt;napisa=B3:\n\n&gt; **\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi all,\n&gt;\n&gt; Please bear with me=\r\n as I&#39;m getting back into JUnit after first using it\n&gt; several years ago. I=\r\n see all the discussions going on and they are far\n&gt; beyond what I conceive=\r\n that I have use for at the moment.\n&gt;\n&gt; Presently, I&#39;m developing part of a=\r\n simulation system in Java for work,\n&gt; and I plan on using JUnit as part of=\r\n NetBeans to do unit testing to\n&gt; bulletproof my code. My question is, as I=\r\n understand it, I can write a\n&gt; class and then &quot;right-click to generate JUn=\r\nit test class&quot; or something. So\n&gt; what happens when I update my real class =\r\nwith additional fixes and/or\n&gt; functionality? Does NB/JU know to automatica=\r\nlly update the test class, or\n&gt; do I have to regen the test class?\n&gt;\n&gt; Than=\r\nks for your time,\n&gt; Mike\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have =\r\nbeen removed]\n\n\n",
