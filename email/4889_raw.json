The game has a specific set of tiles I want to \ncreate in the program.\n\nI made the constructor of the Tile class private and provided static \nmakeTileXyz methods to create tiles.\n\nNow my test methods get quite large. Each of them assures that the tile \nhas just (and only) the requested features. So each test checks for \nspecial items on the cards (e.g. isAbbey, isMarketsquare) and counts \nthe roads coming in and the city parts a tile has.\n\nIn addition tests get more complicated because tiles may be rotated in  \nthe game. The test for makeRoadTurningLeft  (ensure the tile shows a \nroad turning left) has to check whether the road goes south to west, \nwest to north, north to east or east to south. In the end my tests are \nabout 20 to 30 lines of code, but I was used to have 5 liners in other \nprojects.\n\nWhat do you think about this test case size?\n\nWould you create additional methods to help in testing, i.e. for \ncounting the roads on one tile or a method like isSpecial?\n\nWould you place such helpers in the test class (as they are only used \nfor testing)? Does that get to complex, i.e. do you eventually need \ntest cases for your test cases?\n\nWould you rely on some orientation of created tiles, e.g. assume the \nleft turning road is always constructed as from east turning to south \n(maybe this is like the Blackbox / Whitebox discussion)?\n\nWould you even allow incomplete tests (not testing what is &quot;most likely \nworking&quot;, e.g. assuming a tile does not have special items)?\n\n\nThanks for your comments.\n\nRobert\n\n",
