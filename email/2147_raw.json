That would get around the concerns I\nha=\r\nve of running to DB tests too many times on a live DB for fear of\nrunning o=\r\nut of primary (a pretty daft fear I might add).\n\nThis technique, however, i=\r\ns dependant on your locking model.  If you ran\non a database that used opti=\r\nmistic locking (Oracle) you could find that\neverything worked ok.  But if y=\r\nou had committed then problems would have\noccurred.  I guess this would be =\r\npretty rare and only occur when\nmultiple updates are occurring at the same =\r\ntime.  That is stress testing\nand not the job of Junit.  It&#39;s worth being a=\r\nware of the limitations\nthough.\n\nDave\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: Nei=\r\nl Swingler [mailto:nswingler@...]\nSent: 27 July 2001 09:01\nTo: juni=\r\nt@yahoogroups.com\nSubject: RE: [junit] testing database operation\n\n\nThe eas=\r\niest way to clean up the database is to ensure nothing ever gets\ncommited. =\r\nI aquire my connection in setUp (no autoCommit) and rollback\nin\ntearDown().=\r\n\n\n&gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; From: Simon Evans [mailto:sevans@simplydon=\r\ne.com]\n&gt; Sent: 26 July 2001 19:29\n&gt; To: junit@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Subject: [j=\r\nunit] testing database operation\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; i am trying to test objects that use=\r\n the database. in order to leave\nthe\n&gt; database in the same state after the=\r\n test, one test method has to do a\n&gt; store, load and delete. is this normal=\r\n? or is there a way to test each\n&gt; method (store, load, delete) separately,=\r\n maybe using the setUp() and\n&gt; tearDown() methods? is there a standard patt=\r\nern for this?\n&gt;\n&gt; also the assert methods do not throw anything...do they t=\r\nhrow a\n&gt; RuntimeException or somethnig when they fail? because if i want to=\r\n do\nsome\n&gt; clean up in a certain test method using a try-catch-finally\n&gt; bl=\r\nock, do i have\n&gt; to catch a specific runtime exception? or should all clean=\r\nup for\n&gt; all methods\n&gt; be done in the tearDown() method?\n&gt;\n\n\n\nTo unsubscrib=\r\ne from this group, send an email to:\njunit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n \n\nY=\r\nour use of Yahoo!
