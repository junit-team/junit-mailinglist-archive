When I push to the repo, this updates<br/>\nhttp://scalastyle.github.com/ automatically. Then I use jekyll to generate<br/>\nan html site which I push to http://www.scalastyle.org. Thus I get exactly<br/>\nthe same site on github and www.scalastyle.org.<br/>\n<br/>\nI find this works well, because I want to have the two sites. You could<br/>\neven set up a git hook to push to www.junit.org automatically.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf however, you&#39;re happy with junit.github.com, then you don&#39;t need<br/>\nanything but the git repo.<br/>\n<br/>\nMatthew Farwell.<br/>\n<br/>\n2012/11/18 Mirko Friedenhagen &lt;mfriedenhagen@...&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; **<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hello David,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; did you already thing about how to publish content? I see github<br/>\n&gt; offers a simple blogging suite named jekyll<br/>\n&gt; (https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-with-pages). Should we<br/>\n&gt; go for this?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Regards Mirko<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; On Fri, Nov 16, 2012 at 5:14 PM, David Saff &lt;saff@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Summary: can you help patch up the github pages for JUnit to serve as the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; new home of junit.org?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; All,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; You may have recently noticed that http://junit.org was down for a few<br/>\n&gt; &gt; days, and then came back a shadow of its former self. That site has been<br/>\n&gt; &gt; operated and maintained by 8thlight.com for several years, and by Object<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Mentor before that. But it recently had a rather nasty failure, and it&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; &gt; not clear when the content that had been hosted only there will come<br/>\n&gt; back.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Rather than spend a lot of effort recreating the old situation, I&#39;d like<br/>\n&gt; to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; move us to a new situation, in which the team that develops JUnit is the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; same one that develops the primary information sources about JUnit. Along<br/>\n&gt; &gt; those lines, I&#39;d like to get the github pages for JUnit ready to be a<br/>\n&gt; good<br/>\n&gt; &gt; new home for junit.org. These pages are hosted at<br/>\n&gt; &gt; http://kentbeck.github.com/junit. They&#39;re currently pretty sad, but they<br/>\n&gt; &gt; can be edited by opening pull requests against<br/>\n&gt; &gt; https://github.com/KentBeck/junit/tree/gh-pages. Ideally, it would be a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; visually clean single page, with a short description of what JUnit is,<br/>\n&gt; and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; links to downloads, javadoc, mailing list, and the wiki (<br/>\n&gt; &gt; http://github.com/kentbeck/junit/wiki), which is itself incomplete, but<br/>\n&gt; &gt; getting better day by day as a source of user documentation.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; If anyone feels like rolling up their sleeves and give this a try, it<br/>\n&gt; would<br/>\n&gt; &gt; be a great step forward. I&#39;m out of the office all next week, but am<br/>\n&gt; happy<br/>\n&gt; &gt; to move quickly getting the pieces in place upon my return.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Thanks, all,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; David Saff<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Yahoo!
