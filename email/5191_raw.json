If it ain&#39;t \nthe right exception, then the production code is barfing. Barfing is an \nerror -- different from, say, answering 10 instead of 8.\n\n(For those interested in arguing about checked exceptions, first please read \nhttp://c2.com/cgi/wiki?CheckedExceptionsAreOfDubiousValue.)\n\n&gt; [...]  any other\n&gt; &quot;unanticipated&quot; exception would then be an error.  but in practice,\n&gt; it probably doesn&#39;t matter whether the throwing of the wrong\n&gt; &quot;advertised&quot; exception should signal failure or error.\n\nIndeed. It may be impossible to tell, or at least too much work to tell, \nwhether the problem was within or outside of your control. Better to hedge \nyour bets unless you have a good reason to do otherwise. Cheaper, you know.\n\n&gt; i was trying to use the exception example as a starting point for\n&gt; discussion about whether failure/error distinctions in junit are\n&gt; meaningful to anyone.  my experience has been that they are not--\n&gt; in either case, failure or error, you&#39;re led in the direction of a\n&gt; solution.  what do you all think?\n\nIt depends on the context. When the code I&#39;m testing does not throw its own \nexceptions, then an error is almost always either a bug in the test or a non-\nrecoverable problem. When the code I&#39;m testing throws its own exceptions, \nthen an error could be a bunch of different things. I suppose that, in a \nnarrow context, errors are useful, but I don&#39;t really distinguish. The nice \nthing about errors, though, is that they prompt me to look beyond my code and \nmy test for the problem. Maybe the disk is full. Maybe the network is down. \nMaybe there&#39;s an eclipse of the sun. An error often makes me think harder \nabout where the problem might be. That&#39;s usually good.\n\n&gt; this, too, the failure/error distinction and whether it matters, may\n&gt; be a good FAQ item too?\n\nMike?\n\n--\nJ. B.
