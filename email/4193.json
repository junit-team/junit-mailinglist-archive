Having <br/>\n100% coverage of your code unit tested doesn&#39;t mean that your product <br/>\nhas no bug.  Try other testing approach too.<br/>\n- how confident are you that one module is working fine or not?  Start <br/>\nby testing the modules you think are the more likely to have bugs.  If <br/>\nsome kind of tests already exist for some buggy module, try to recompile <br/>\nand execute them.  If you don&#39;t have tests, it&#39;s the right time to write <br/>\nsome.  (I don&#39;t know how many tests you have already written, it&#39;s maybe <br/>\ntoo time consuming to fix them all right now, or maybe not).<br/>\n- force the tests to be compiled and executed during the normal build<br/>\n- it can frustrating for developers to face a huge buggy code so try to <br/>\nfind metrics showing that you are making progress (# open bugs, class <br/>\ntestes, % coverage).<br/>\n<br/>\n-Vladimir<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nVladimir Bossicard<br/>\nwww.bossicard.com</div>",
