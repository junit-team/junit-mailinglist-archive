I could have sworn that the\n&gt; identifier you need was actually documented somewhere or stored in a\n&gt; static variable, but I cannot for the life of me find it right now.\n&gt; \n&gt; On Wed, 26 Dec 2001, lchalupa wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; New to Junit.\n&gt; &gt; Please give advice on my approach to testing a gui.\n&gt; &gt; In the gui, my target method displays an instance of jOptionPane \nclass\n&gt; &gt; to confirm a selection the user has just made. In my junit test\n&gt; &gt; method, I want to be able to select and close the button on\n&gt; &gt; jOptionPane after it has been displayed.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I am not sure how to do this. I have done this on dialogs that I \nhave\n&gt; &gt; created myself by looking up the button and using doClick().  \nSeems to\n&gt; &gt; work just fine.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; So, do I use the same approach on jOptionPane? I assume I would \nlook\n&gt; &gt; up the identifier of the button in the source and refer to it in \nthe\n&gt; &gt; test method?  Or am I missing a more direct approach to the \nproblem?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; In short, I am not sure how to test a jOption Pane using Junit.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Am I on the right track?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Thanks.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; lee\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; &gt; junit-unsubscribe@y...\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Your use of Yahoo!
