[mailto:tumb@...]\n&gt;\n&gt; Is there any recommended (or better yet documented) ideal level of\n&gt; testing?\n\nJ.B. Rainsberger has a nice phrase to answer this: &quot;Test until fear turns to\nboredom.&quot;  That&#39;s one way to think about it.\n\nThere are so many types of testing, there is no one ideal level.  I mean\nthere&#39;s unit testing, subsystem testing, integration testing, various types\nof load testing (performance, stress, reliability, scalability), install and\nconfiguration testing, etc.\n\nThere are a few metrics that can be a good guide though.\n\n1. Code coverage analysis.  Everyone will say 100% code coverage is ideal.\nThey won&#39;t always say 100% what -- line, method, branch, path?  But in my\nexperience 100% coverage of any kind never gets done in reality (maybe the\nnext product I work on!).  70% statement coverage is very good for a new\nserver-side software product of 200K lines of code, in my experience.  Maybe\nit&#39;s easier for GUI programs.\n\n2. McCabe&#39;s metric (aka, cyclomatic complexity -- based on the number of\nbranches possible in a method).  This metric along with lines of code\nmetrics, actually, can be a guide to how many bugs you should find in a\npiece of code (more if it&#39;s new code, less if it&#39;s tried and true, reused\ncode).  But it&#39;s just a heuristic.  Can&#39;t be relied on for more than a guide\nfor where you should focus your tests.\n\n3. Bug metrics.  If you track bugs and you can get reports from the bug\ntracker somehow, look at bug entry and fix trends.  Bug finding, represented\nby new bugs entered, should slow down prior to shipping the product.  If\nthere&#39;s no sign of slowing, and QA is finding good bugs, then you obviously\ncan&#39;t have much confidence in the quality of the software.  The rate of bug\nfixing should also slow down and stabilize prior to shipping, because\nroughly 1 out of 4 bug fixes introduces a regression or a new bug.  So QA\nneeds time to re-test software after it&#39;s been fixed.\n\n&gt; Our company is working on adopting XP and perhaps test driven practises.\n&gt; We have a question about whether certain groups are testing too little or\n&gt; too much. How, if at all, do you determine what&#39;s too little or too much?\n\nYou should really check out the testdrivendevelopment@yahoogroups.com group.\nThere&#39;s a currently a discussion about how TDD is more about design than\ntesting.\n\nScott Stirling\n\n\n\n",
