It is very very easy reading and it contains\nonly necessary information. I even found this one easier to read than the first\ntwo books of the serie.\n\n&gt; How generic is the book?  Is it somewhat (or greatly) applicable to\n&gt; projects outside of Java?\n\nIn the &quot;building&quot; part, I presume, if you&#39;re using .NET, you can replace\nCruiseControl with CruiseControl.NET and Ant with NAnt, JUnit with NUnit, etc.\nSource code control system is CVS so if you&#39;re using something like VSS you\nwon&#39;t be able to take advantage of the same branching, merging concepts.\n\nDeployment talks about JAR, WAR files, which are specific to Java (even though\none can see them as a pure packaging mechanism).\n\nI haven&#39;t started the monitoring part yet, but I assume it&#39;s going to talk\nabout JMX, etc.\n\nEven though the concepts should be applicable to different programming\nenvironments, the book uses Java related tools, as the name goes &quot;How to build,\ndeploy and monitor Java apps&quot;. I, personally, wouldn&#39;t enjoy reading about\nanother technology and trying to apply the concepts, filling the gaps, etc.\n\nHope this helps,\n\n - Yagiz Erkan -\n http://yagiz.blogspot.com\n http://www.erkans.com\n\n",
