My experiences range from<br/>\nsmall software (TestNG - 300 tests, less than 10 seconds to run them all) to<br/>\nfairly large ones, where functional tests takes anywhere between five and<br/>\nten hours (yes, 5 and 10).  Using groups in such systems is invaluable.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlthough I have to say that for such large scale software, the hurdle is<br/>\nusually much more the communication between the QA and the engineering teams<br/>\nthan it is about test infrastructure, but every bit counts.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy hunch is that the result would be easier to manage and would have much<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; faster tests, on<br/>\n&gt; the whole.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Agree, that&#39;s why groups called &quot;fast&quot; and &quot;slow&quot; make much more sense than<br/>\n&quot;unit&quot; and &quot;functional&quot;, in my opinion.<br/>\n<br/>\nDo bear in mind how much I&#39;m speculating.
