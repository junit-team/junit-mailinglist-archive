I have trouble with this because if<br/>\n&gt; Agitar can make observations then humans could write tests.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yes, and for that reason, I don&#39;t think Agitar will make a code base &quot;more<br/>\nTDD-able&quot; if that code base doesn&#39;t have this quality in the first place.<br/>\n<br/>\nActually I disagree with the use of the term &#39;many&#39; and &#39;sometimes&#39;.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; It is always possible to write tests first.  The question is whether<br/>\n&gt; it is always practical.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Fair point, and I agree.  If the cost of doing TDD is more expensive than<br/>\ndoing &quot;regular&quot; testing, it doesn&#39;t make sense to pick TDD (assuming that<br/>\nthe final product will have the same quality either way).<br/>\n<br/>\nSome of the situations I have encountered in the past and the present where<br/>\nTDD is not a practical choice are GUI or mobile developments (something I do<br/>\na lot these days).  I also work fairly regularly with very large code bases<br/>\nthat have grown organically over several years, and again, practicing TDD at<br/>\nthis level would cost a lot more than doing things traditionally.<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course, I make it a point in these circumstances to try and improve the<br/>\nsituation as I go along, but again, it&#39;s not always obvious to choose<br/>\nbetween a new feature and a cosmetic refactoring that might improve your<br/>\ncode base down the line.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is why I like to work on open-source projects on the side:  it feels<br/>\nlike a breath of fresh air where your imagination and your principles can be<br/>\nlaw :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nCédric<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",
