It also encourages<br/>\ndevelopers to<br/>\nproduce fully working, integrated and unit tested code from day one.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I&#39;m not sure where your impression is coming from; to me it doesn&#39;t<br/>\nsound<br/>\nlike a team where that can happen really has groked Agile software<br/>\ndevelopment.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; In my experience the project managers<br/>\n&gt; for sprints do not understand the need for engineering specs,<br/>\n&gt; hence they do not exist, or if they do they are after the<br/>\n&gt; fact.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;m not sure what you mean by &quot;engineering specs&quot;, but I also don&#39;t<br/>\nunderstand why the project manager has to understand their need for them<br/>\nto<br/>\nbe produced at the right time. It&#39;s the responsibility of the team to<br/>\nproduce what is needed when it&#39;s needed.<br/>\n[Bob Bondi] Engineering specs derive from product requirements. A simple<br/>\nexample is the login screen. <br/>\nA requirement states users must login in to the system.<br/>\nAn engineer codes for that case as well as the bad username or bad<br/>\npassword or the forgotten password. <br/>\nThis simple case is a 3 to 1 fan out of the requirement. In more complex<br/>\ncode the fanouts are not <br/>\ndiscussed in engineering requirements. The QA team has no clue (in some<br/>\ncases) how to properly test. <br/>\nGood whitebox can overcome this but you bump into short sprints and the<br/>\ntime to whitebox is not there. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; There is no time in the plan for rework of bad code.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>If you need time in the plan for rework, you are not doing enough of it.<br/>\nRefactoring, as we call reworking code in small very controlled steps,<br/>\nshould be part of the developers minute-to-minute work. They should be<br/>\ndoing<br/>\nso much of it, so tightly intermingled with the rest of their work, that<br/>\nit&#39;s impossible to measure how much of their time they are spending<br/>\ndoing<br/>\nit.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; There is no time in the sprint for rigorous QA.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>QA should be an ongoing effort during the sprint, parallel to the rest<br/>\nof<br/>\nthe work. If there is &quot;no time&quot; for this, the team really is not a truly<br/>\nAgile one.<br/>\n[Bob Bondi] This assumes the team delivers code that can be tested<br/>\nbeyond Unit testing. If so, I agree. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; This leads to quantity not quality.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Agreed. But it has nothing to do with Agility.<br/>\n[Bob Bondi] I&#39;ll be on the back burner for awhile watching how this<br/>\nprocess works. I do not want to <br/>\nbecome reactionary about it, only to be &#39;agile&#39; enough to really provide<br/>\nthe testing customers demand <br/>\nprior to receiving products. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Remember that satellite that crashed in the<br/>\n&gt; planet Mars because different methods of measuring speed were<br/>\n&gt; used. Effective integration testing would have caught that problem.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>As would have better communication and collaboration. That hardly was an<br/>\nAgile project, was it? ;)<br/>\n[Bob Bondi] communication and collaboration: my points exactly restated<br/>\nso eloquently! <br/>\n<br/>\nCheers, Ilja<br/>\n[Bob Bondi] Back at ya :) <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________<br/>\n<br/>\nYAHOO!
