In fact, it looks like it isn&#39;t a JVM\ndefect, but bug in the Linux glibc/pthread libraries. It only affects\nthe results of System.exit, so it&#39;s not even a fatal bug for JUnit. The\n*only* thing that doesn&#39;t work is the exit codes.\n\nSince the the two failures reported in:\n\nhttp://www.egroups.com/message/junit/257\n\nare identical to those in:\n\nhttp://www.egroups.com/message/junit/108\n\nI took the leap of assuming they are caused by the same underlying\nproblem. The bug was initially claimed to be in libc.so 2.2, but not in\n2.1.2 which is the default RedHat libc so I could be wrong. Later data\n(January 10 of this year) suggests that libpthread-0.9 is the culprit.\n\nThe JVM defect was discussed in:\n\nhttp://www.egroups.com/message/junit/113\n\nand is listed at Sun:\n\nhttp://developer.java.sun.com/developer/bugParade/bugs/4388732.html\n\nRegards,\n\nRob\n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
