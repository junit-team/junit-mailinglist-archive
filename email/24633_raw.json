Stefan Birkner has sent his email to the junit mailing \nlist and Nat Pryce&#39;s sample project is about separating junit4 and \nhamcrest. Thus I assumed we were talking about the next (or some future) \nJunit4 release.\n\nRegarding JUnit5 the separation makes more sense but should be supported \nby a committment to compatiblity and extensibility. I think there is a \nbroad agreement that JUnit5 should concentrate on the aspects of running \ntests but needs to be extensible and needs to provide hooks for other \nprojects like test-starters (IDE, maven surefire, pitest ....), test \nresult reporters (IDE, maven surefire, CI server plugins, sonar qube, \n...), test environment enhancers (Spring, JMock, Arquillian and all the \nothers that have custom runner implementations) and many more. But as \nmore and more projects will use these hooks they have to be reliable and \nstable (at least across minor releases).\n\nI tried to keep it short and will continue discussion at the mailing list.\n\nStefan\n\n\nAm 12.01.2015 um 17:26 schrieb Esko Luontola esko.luontola@... \n[junit]:\n&gt; Some time ago the testing-java-8 mailing list was started to discuss\n&gt; things like these; to throw around ideas about new testing frameworks\n&gt; and tools in the post-Java 8 world, without cluttering the JUnit mailing\n&gt; list with non-JUnit stuff.\n&gt;\n&gt; https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/testing-java-8\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Stefan Bechtold stefan.bechtold@... [junit] wrote on 12.1.2015 13:53:\n&gt;&gt; Concerning the exception handling, I like the JUnit Rule based approach for applications up to Java 7 (without support for lambdas) very well. This provides a way to execute a piece of code and provide information about the code that was executed. In order to be compatible to Java 7 (and maybe 6), I think it is a must-have feature in the next testing framework. Anyways, wherever possible, I would strongly recommend to leave the assertion part out of the test framework and simply provide an extension point (like the @Rule annotation) for 3rd party libraries. For Java 8, I really prefer the lambda approach, as it makes the test code much more readable and expresses the intend of the test case more clearly.\n\n\n",
