I&#39;m just asking :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n    <br/>\n    The answer is that we are following the model that many companies such as<br/>\n    Sun (NetBeans-&gt;Forte), Red Hat, Suse etc. (Linux-&gt;branded Linux), Rational<br/>\n    (Eclipse-&gt;XDE), IBM (Eclipse-&gt;WSAD) pioneered, where they build commercial<br/>\n    tools that add to open source tools.<br/>\n<br/>\nA little different though.  Sun owns NetBeans (another example is<br/>\nOpenOffice/StarOffice), IBM owns Eclipse.  I bought one copy of RedHat<br/>\n(5.2) but now that I have a high bandwith connection & CD burner I<br/>\ndownload the ISO images.  Rational is part of the Eclipse Consortium.   <br/>\n<br/>\n    Don&#39;t forget that many commercial IDE vendors reship JUnit in an effort to<br/>\n    add value to their own products.<br/>\n<br/>\nYes.  This, i think, would be a better comparison.<br/>\n<br/>\n    Likewise, there are people who earn their<br/>\n    living writing books and consulting around open source tools,<br/>\n<br/>\nLike my upcoming JUnit oriented book :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n    or use open<br/>\n    source tools in one way or another to promote their own ventures. For<br/>\n    example, &quot;The Coad Letter: Test-driven Development Edition, issue 102:<br/>\n    JUnit&quot; written by yourself asks that the reader &quot;consider Saorsa&#39;s intensive<br/>\n    5-day, Hands-on TDD course taught by Dave Astels.&quot; I assume you are not<br/>\n    giving this course away for free.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou assume correctly.  That&#39;s also a different situation, though.  But I<br/>\ndo see your point.  If I could afford to give the course for free, I<br/>\nwould, but I can&#39;t so I won&#39;t.<br/>\n<br/>\n    In the case of Enhanced JUnit, it is a little strange because we are<br/>\n    actually grafting some functionality that already exists in an enterprise<br/>\n    testing tool (Test Mentor) onto JUnit. There is actually more code (and<br/>\n    functionality) in the add-on than JUnit.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen it&#39;s more than an extension... more like the previous examples.. a<br/>\nproduct based on an opensource project.  Another example is ArgoUML &<br/>\nPosidon<br/>\n<br/>\n    <br/>\n    I hope this helps, Mike<br/>\n<br/>\nI doesn&#39;t hurt :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nDave<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________________________________________________<br/>\nDave Astels<br/>\n  Coauthor of &quot;A Practical Guide to XP&quot; <br/>\n  Editor of the Test-Driven Development Edition of The Coad Letter<br/>\nCEO & Master Software Craftsman <br/>\n<br/>\nAn Agile Software Studio<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed] </span></blockquote></div>",
