It&#39;s right\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; there in chapter 8 page 168. Now they are using mocks from the\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; easymock.org framework but I don&#39;t think that makes much of a\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; difference. Maybe their examples were based on an earlier version of\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; JUnit where this wasn&#39;t a problem?\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; I love Vince Massol. I think he&#39;s brilliant. In this one design/coding\n&gt;  &gt; choice, I disagree with him.\n&gt; \n&gt; What&#39;s wrong with that? (happy to learn a new thing) :-)\n\nNothing. I don&#39;t mind disagreeing, especially with people who are so \nagreeable about it.\n\n&gt; Steve mentioned in another email that the error do not get reported\n&gt; properly. Strange. It has always worked for me with either easymock or\n&gt; dynamocks.\n\nI never tried it. It just seemed icky to me.\n\n&gt; That it is now automatic in jmock is of course much better.\n\nAmen.\n\nEveryone: buy Vince&#39;s book.\n-- \nJ. B.
