Is the test isolation also the same?\n\nI got used to that style of organizing tests when learning TDD and writing\ntests with JDave. I&#39;ve found 1-2 levels is nearly always enough, though I\nappreaciate the flexibility of arbitrary depth. For other JVM languages,\nand Java with lambda expressions, I&#39;ve written an even more flexible\ntesting framework: http://specsy.org/ You might like it, so have a look.\n(It requires the http://jumi.fi/ test runner, which is still lacking in\ntool support, so that&#39;s a negative side, for now.)\n\n\nOn Wed, Aug 14, 2013 at 7:53 AM, Aaron V. &lt;gruen0aermel@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt; **\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;m announcing the 1.0 release of junit-nested, a TestRunner that allows\n&gt; test classes to contain non-static inner classes which also have test\n&gt; methods. Inner test classes can be nested to arbitrary depth, and @Before\n&gt; and @After methods and @Rules will be run at all levels--that is, tests in\n&gt; inner classes will get the benefit of befores and afters in their parent\n&gt; (and grandparent, etc) classes.\n&gt;\n&gt; Of course, whether or not you _should_ make use of nested tests I find is\n&gt; a matter of debate, but nonetheless it&#39;s a useful tool to have at your\n&gt; disposal (and rspec (ruby), Cedar (obj-c) and jasmine (javascript) all\n&gt; promote nested test structures).\n&gt;\n&gt; Source code (and an example) is available\n&gt; https://github.com/avh4/junit-nested and the jar is available on maven\n&gt; central as net.avh4.test:junit-nested:1.0.1\n&gt;\n&gt; It is currently licensed under the EPL. If you have need of a different\n&gt; license, please contact me.\n&gt;\n&gt; Also, if anyone with more knowledge of the internals of\n&gt; BlockJUnit4ClassRunner can make any suggestions on improving my attempts to\n&gt; extend it, I would appreciate the feedback.\n&gt;\n&gt; https://github.com/avh4/junit-nested/blob/master/src/main/java/net/avh4/test/junit/InnerRunner.java\n&gt;\n&gt; Cheers,\n&gt; --Aaron V.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n",
