All(?)\nIDE&#39;s support running JUnit tests in some way as well as buildtools, CI\nsevers etc. One issue with JUnit4 has always been that IDEs can&#39;t keep up\nwith JUnit and JUnit in turn is constrained with the current state of IDEs.\nIt is hard for other tools to compete because JUnit is already there.\n\n&quot;Feature introspection&quot;\n\nIt would be great if there was a way for 3rd part tools to ask JUnit for\nfeatures. A basic feature could be &quot;run all tests on classpath&quot;, or &quot;run\nnamed test&quot;, &quot;run category&quot;. As a 3rd party tool vendor I could then query\nJUnit for features and delegate more of the work to JUnit. If we take\ncategories as an example. Today eclipse simply doesn&#39;t recognize them but\nwith feature introspection it could just appear as a choice in a menu.\n\nA feature would have some basic categorization where some categories are\nwell known such as &quot;run&quot; so that tools can logically present the basics.\nA feature would have some way to declare it&#39;s required input, referably\nwith some types (like: A test, A category, A suite, A test with parameters\netc, Needs a resultbuilder etc).\nA feature would have some way to describe itself &quot;Runs the specified\ncategory of tests&quot;\nA feature can be contributed by a 3rd party like a custom runner can.\n\nWith features it would also open up new possibilities with tools like Ant,\nMaven, Gradle etc where features can be delegated to JUnit and it would be\nsimpler to build and maintain testrelated tasks since they would not\nrequire to be available as compiled tasks before the build starts,\nextensions can be built and maintained in the same way as your tests until\nyou want to share them with others.\n\nAdmittedly this is an idea that is not finished. I&#39;m basically aiming at\nbridging the gap a bit between 3rd party tools and the JUnit core without\nhaving to implement UI and solve UX problems.\n\nThoughts?\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n",
