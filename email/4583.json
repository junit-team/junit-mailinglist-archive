Binder (explaining to his <br/>\ndaughter why his book (more than 1,000 pages) was so big)<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Testing is complicated and I&#39;m an engineer. Making sure tht things work <br/>\nright if very important for engineers. [...] So when engineers build <br/>\nsomething or answer a question about how to build things, we have to be <br/>\nsure we&#39;re right. We have to be sure nothing is left out. It takes a lot <br/>\nof work.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; 2) what junit is doing? it compares the expected with<br/>\n&gt; actual but this can be done manualy<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>the goal of automated testing is to remove the &quot;manually&quot; from the <br/>\nsoftware engineer&#39;s vocabulary.  From the same book, page 803: &quot;Manual <br/>\ntesting is error-prone and tedious. In contracst, an automated test <br/>\nsuite will never be distracted by a phone call, type the wrong input, or <br/>\nmiss one incorrect character in 10,000 lines of output&quot;.  JUnit is a <br/>\nframework that help you (and all your co-workers) to create an automated <br/>\ntesting environment.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; since each<br/>\n&gt; developer will be doing this in its development<br/>\n&gt; routine<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>the developers should all use the same testing framework<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; 3) When i have to get input from the konsole<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>separate the input (console) from the core application (what you&#39;re <br/>\ndoing with this information).  Treat your console like an input class <br/>\nthat uses your core business module.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; 3) In examples like fibinnaci iam able ot chack<br/>\n&gt; only for null and i cannot chack for assert equals<br/>\n&gt; because it cannot ale to give the relut value becuse<br/>\n&gt; it is dynamically displaying, how can i do i need the<br/>\n&gt; reply <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>separate the business (calculation of the suite) from the output (the <br/>\ndisplay).<br/>\n<br/>\n-Vladimir<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nVladimir Bossicard<br/>\nwww.bossicard.com</div>",
