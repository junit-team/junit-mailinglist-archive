Establish some use cases, something that maps clearly to both \ndatabases. For example, &quot;retrieve customer billing address&quot; or &quot;get \ncustomer&#39;s orders for this month&quot;.\n2. Set up a junit test that tests this case for a specific client.\n3. Run it against the old database\n4. Migrate enough data over to the new database to be able to rerun the \ntest.\n5. Repeat 2-4 for different clients\n6. Generalise step 2.\n\nJim.\n\n\nJason Rogers wrote:\n\n&gt; On Mon, 5 Jan 2004 15:36:28 +0100, Bauduin Raphael \n&gt; &lt;raphael.bauduin@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;&gt;Hi all,\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;I&#39;m totally new to JUnit, and read the FAQ, the Cookbook. Discovered\n&gt;&gt;DBUnit, but I&#39;m not sure how I should approach my problem.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;We migrate a database from one data schema to another, completely\n&gt;&gt;different. I want to be sure data is migrated correctly (so that for\n&gt;&gt;example a customer keeps its orders).\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;My first idea was to iterate on customers in the source database, and\n&gt;&gt;check its data against the new database.\n&gt;&gt;For example, for a customer, I would have tests on, amongst others:\n&gt;&gt;-contacts\n&gt;&gt;-orders\n&gt;&gt;-address\n&gt;&gt;and each test would be run for each row coming from the source database.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;Is that the correct approach?\n&gt;&gt;From what I discovered of JUnit, I&#39;m not sure how to integrate the\n&gt;&gt;iteration in the test suite ( The same test would be run against all rows\n&gt;&gt;from the database).\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;Thanks in advance for your help. I hope I didn&#39;t miss any obvious thing\n&gt;&gt;before posting this....\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;Raph\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Raph,\n&gt; \n&gt; This sounds like a fine approach.  Why not try it in a small fashion and \n&gt; see if it would meet your needs?  As far as the implementation is \n&gt; concerned... I would hope that you already have something of a persistence \n&gt; abstraction layer in which you could swap out the DBs.  The first thing I \n&gt; might do is to build up models on one DB, swap in the new DB, build models \n&gt; again and compare them.  Make sense?\n&gt; \n&gt; =jason\n&gt; \n\n-- \n\nJim Cheesman\nDpto. de Investigaci�n y Desarrollo\nOptenet S.A.\n\n(34) 91 357 9285\n\n\n",
