I have been searching the archives and looking for\ninformation pertaining to my current needs. Having found no answers quit\nlike what I am looking for I would like to ask for some help in the area of\ncustomizing the junit.swingui.TestRunner.\n\nI was asked to come up with a way for our QA testers to test network Java\napplications that have no user interface. The end tester should not be\nrequired to know anything about Java. The network folks will guarantee that\neach tester will have a JVM installed on the there machine.\n\nI created 5 classes in the junit.http package called:\nHttpTestCase extends TestCase\nServerObject\nObjectHandler\nSerializableObject\nRemoteTestRunner\n\nI am using HttpTestCase to create myTest were I use a method called\ninvokeRemoteMethod(\n    String fullyQualifiedName,\n    String methodName,\n    Object[] args,\n    Class[] argtypes\n);\n\nthe method uses a ServerObject to store the data about the class that needs\nto have it&#39;s method invoked, then uses SerializableObject to serialize the\nServerObject and post it to the RemoteTestRunner servlet. On the server the\nServerObject is desterilized and the class is instantiated then with a bit\nof reflection the method is invoked. The servlet returns the data to the\nclient as an object or wrapper object if the return type is a primitive.\nAll of the is wrapped up in a executable jar file so that the tester only\nneeds to double click the jar file and then up comes\njunit.swingui.TestRunner to display the results of the test.\n\nWhat I am interested in doing is adding an assertSuccess method to the\njunit.framework and extend the junit.runner.TestRunListener with a public\nstatic final int STATUS_SUCCESS = 3 so that I can create a testSuccess\nmethod like the testFailed method found in junit.swingui.TestRunner. I have\ntraced most of it from the interface on. What I am having trouble with is\nhow to get message data to print out to the DefaultListModel. I want to say\nthat there should be a listener for exceptions that is handling the output\nto the list box but I can not seem to find my way into it.\n\nIf anyone has a previous post or other related reading material they would\ncare to share, it would be well received.\n\nThanks for listening to me carry on.\n\nBryan LaPlante\nNetwork Web Applications\n\n\n\n",
