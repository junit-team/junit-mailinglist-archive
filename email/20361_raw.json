If junits or application aslo writes its logs to\nstandard =\r\noutput then this output is mixed. For example, failures will\nbe written ins=\r\nide the logs of the application and not in the end.\nMoreover, if there is s=\r\nome activity in @AfterClass that also prints to\nthe standard output than th=\r\nis will be written down AFTER summary of\nthe Junit.\n\nI have partial solutio=\r\nn to this situation. TextListener (or a new\nclass, say ConsoleListener) sho=\r\nuld create new PrintWriter(new\nStringWriter()) and collect the result their=\r\n.  On testRunFinished() it\nshould flush the information from StringWriter t=\r\no the PrintStream that\nreceived in the constructor (String.out for example)=\r\n.\nThis solution doesn&#39;t solve situation when there is some writing to\nthe s=\r\ntandard output in @AfterClass.\n\n\n\n",
