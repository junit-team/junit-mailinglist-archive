I created my first\n&gt; test\n&gt; &gt; case to test a simple class used by a MIDlet, and\n&gt; it\n&gt; &gt; didn&#39;t work because it&#39;s not possible to do\n&gt; something\n&gt; &gt; like that:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; public static void main (String args[])\n&gt; &gt; {\n&gt; &gt;        The J2ME code...\n&gt; &gt; }\n&gt; Sounds frustrating.  I&#39;m afraid I don&#39;t know a lot\n&gt; about J2ME, but I \n&gt; know a fair bit about running JUnit.  If J2ME\n&gt; doesn&#39;t run code within a \n&gt; &quot;main&quot; method, can you give a short example of how\n&gt; J2ME code running \n&gt; inside a sandbox looks?  Thanks,\n&gt; \n&gt;     David Saff\n\nIt&#39;s very similar to a servlet or applet, but in the\nmicro edition, our &quot;let&quot; is the midlet. The\naplications must have a derived class of the MIDlet\nclass (it is part of the J2ME core) and implement the\nabstract methods startApp, pauseApp and destroyApp.\nThe device itself, when receive the apropriate user&#39;s\ninput, call the startApp, so the program begins. I\ndon&#39;t remember very well of applet implementation, but\ni think that there&#39;s a method called start with the\nsame propose. The fact is that i can&#39;t test my J2ME\nclasses because i believe that the JUnit try to use\nthem inside a main method. I believe so because the\nkind of Error (Error, not Exception) that is throwed\nduring the tests is the same that occurs when i tried\nto use main method a long time ago, just to test the\nJ2ME sandbox. I already tried to use the J2MEUnit\n(that looks to don&#39;t have the problem), but there are\nmany other problems with this framework, for example,\ni think that 40% of assert methods didn&#39;t existe\nthere, like assertFalse or assertEquals. I used\nassertTrue(!...) and others tricks, but I still having\nproblems with another things...\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n_______________________________________________________ \nYahoo! doce lar.
