I was thinking \nabout having the first thread sleep for some time at certain vulnerable points \nin the code,  giving other threads time&nbsp;to access the shared resources, and \nsee what happened. Unfortunately a thread can also be preempted in the middle of \na Java instruction like someCounter++, and there&#39;s&nbsp;no way to make a Java \nThread sleep just after the someCounter has been read from memory, but before it \nhas incremented it and written it back into memory. And that is exactly what we \nhave experienced will happen on a multiprocessor machine, that a thread is \npreempted in the middle of a Java instruction!!</font></div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\">Jakob Jenkov</font></div></html></div>",
