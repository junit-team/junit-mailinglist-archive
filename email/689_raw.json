One thing I feels uncomfortable about XP is pair\nprogramming. As Beck wrote: &quot;Pair programming is a dialog between two people trying\nto simultaneously program and understand how to program better&quot;. But\nhow to make sure this pair&#39;s relationship cooperative instead of\ncompetitive(in negative sense)?\nFor example, we can not always push two people sitting together\nand wish they can get along and do the work more effectively than one.\nAdditionally, I always see the senior people with stronger option than\njunior guy. Do you think it is possible to let them communicating equally?\n\nThank you\nJason\n\n-- \nBest regards,\n junit_jason                          mailto:junit_jason@...\n\n\n\n",
