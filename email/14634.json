It&#39;s a strong suggestion,<br/>\none that the compiler respects, but one that is not guaranteed to be<br/>\nhonoured by the runtime environment.<br/>\n<br/>\nOut of curiousity: if you couldn&#39;t have private methods, would you<br/>\nchange your coding style at all? Would that approach end up being<br/>\nbetter, or worse? Would you consider trying it out?<br/>\n<br/>\n(I have, it did change my style, and I believe it was for the better -<br/>\nbut that&#39;s me)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; But if you <br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t think private is unnecessary, then I think there&#39;s a<br/>\n </span></blockquote>contradiction <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; in your philosophy that&#39;s worth exploring further.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Indeed. Now, do you think it&#39;s possible to write code without a<br/>\nprivate keyword? If not, how do you explain, for example, Smalltalk<br/>\nand Python? If you do, then I think there&#39;s a contradiction in your<br/>\nphilosophy that&#39;s worth exploring further.<br/>\n<br/>\nOr should we just end the discussion?<br/>\n<br/>\n[Quick digression: Python does have private methods of a sort... but<br/>\nthey _are_ a naming convention (leading double underscores), which are<br/>\nonly partly enforced by the environment. To quote _Dive Into Python_:<br/>\n&quot;If you try to call a private method, Python will raise a slightly<br/>\nmisleading exception, saying that the method does not exist. Of course<br/>\nit does exist, but it&#39;s private, so it&#39;s not accessible outside the<br/>\nclass.Strictly speaking, private methods are accessible outside their<br/>\nclass, just not easily accessible. Nothing in Python is truly private;<br/>\ninternally, the names of private methods and attributes are mangled<br/>\nand unmangled on the fly to make them seem inaccessible by their given<br/>\nnames. You can access the __parse method of the MP3FileInfo class by<br/>\nthe name _MP3FileInfo__parse. Acknowledge that this is interesting,<br/>\nbut promise to never, ever do it in real code. Private methods are<br/>\nprivate for a reason, but like many other things in Python, their<br/>\nprivateness is ultimately a matter of convention, not force.}]</div>",
