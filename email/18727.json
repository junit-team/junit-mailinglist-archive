Sorry.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; That said, I&#39;m very curious why you would want to use the test name,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; particularly in the manner indicated by your example below. Could you<br/>\n&gt; &gt; expand?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Well, it turns out they don&#39;t use it in the actual test case, but in<br/>\n&gt; the setUp/tearDown instead. Specifically to insert into/delete from a<br/>\n&gt; database with test-specific data, or in another case, to load only a<br/>\n&gt; subset of the spring wiring based on the name to improve on testing<br/>\n&gt; loadtimes.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Anyway...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; It seems like the RunListeneer would have a reference to the currently<br/>\n&gt; running test, simply because of its &quot;testStarted&quot; and &quot;testFinished&quot;<br/>\n&gt; functions:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; /**<br/>\n&gt; * Called when an atomic test is about to be started.<br/>\n&gt; * @param description the description of the test that is about to be run<br/>\n&gt; * (generally a class and method name)<br/>\n&gt; */<br/>\n&gt; public void testStarted( Description description) throws Exception {<br/>\n&gt; }<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Is it possible to get access to this from within the test class<br/>\n&gt; itself?<br/>\n<br/>\nNo, by design. Sorry about that.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; If not, it seems like I&#39;d have to write a custom Runner, but<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m having trouble finding information on creating Runners. Are there<br/>\n&gt; any known resources for JUnit 4?<br/>\n<br/>\nInformation on custom runners is currently somewhat lacking. It<br/>\nappears from your later message that you&#39;ve somewhat successfully<br/>\nnavigating the waters. Any interest in writing up a short blog entry<br/>\nor article on your experiences?
