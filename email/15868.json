As a professional QA person with over 20 years hand-on experience it is my sad duty to report that the schema for testing being discussed is a set-back to quality. It is the case that quantity is the current goal in software development. The trend to go live and debug after customers start calling support is real. Developers should do their unit testing, of course. The problem is (especially in Agile methods) the time for QA has been cut drastically. The need for integration testing is greater than ever before, but the time QA has for that activity is reduced to such short periods that that type of testing is relegated to last, IMHO.\r<br/>\n \r<br/>\nAs an example, using the Agile method (scrums, sprints) where a sprint of 28 days is in place code is not ready for testing until maybe the 21 day. In my experience the project managers for sprints do not understand the need for engineering specs, hence they do not exist, or if they do they are after the fact. There is no time in the plan for rework of bad code. There is no time in the sprint for rigorous QA. This leads to quantity not quality. I admit I read this group because we use Java (moving to .net) and I wish I had the time to learn the tools you provide. Perhaps in the future. Until that time and even beyond great unit testing is only and input/output type of test. Remember that satellite that crashed in the planet Mars because different methods of measuring speed were used. Effective integration testing would have caught that problem.\r<br/>\n \r<br/>\nAllowing developers the time to create good code is a partnership with QA - allowing them the time to effectively test it. Is it a waste of time...ask the customers if they want products that work or products that meet the goals of project managers.\r<br/>\n \r<br/>\n&lt;Lurker mode on&gt;\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nBob Bondi \r<br/>\nQuality Assurance Programming Technician \r<br/>\nSpillman Technologies, Inc. \r<br/>\nToll Free: 800.860.8026, ext. 6213 \r<br/>\nLocal: 801.428.6820 \r<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:bbondi@...\">bbondi@...</a> &lt;mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:bbondi@...\">bbondi@...</a>&gt;  \r<br/>\nwww.spillman.com &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.spillman.com/\">http://www.spillman.com/</a>&gt;  \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n________________________________\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a>] On Behalf Of J.
