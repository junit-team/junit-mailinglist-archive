It&#39;s healthy =\r\nto ask the\n&gt;  &gt; original poster if this design is really necessary, but if\n=\r\n&gt;  &gt; they say &quot;yes&quot;, then we should just move on to solving their\n&gt;  &gt; prob=\r\nlem and not patronize them on how pure their architecture is.\n&gt;  \n&gt;  You ar=\r\ne probably more referring to my posts than to J.B.&#39;s.\n&gt;  \n&gt;  If the OP said=\r\n something along the lines of &quot;I know the design is\n&gt;  suboptimal, but I cu=\r\nrrently can&#39;t do something about it&quot;, I would have\n&gt;  accepted that and con=\r\ncentrated on solving his testing problem using Junit.\n&gt;  \n&gt;  But I didn&#39;t u=\r\nnderstand him to say that. Instead I understood him to say\n&gt;  something mor=\r\ne along the lines of &quot;my design is quite good the way it is,\n&gt;  and it is s=\r\ntrange that Junit doesn&#39;t support testing it very well.&quot;\n&gt;  \n&gt;  From the li=\r\nttle I know about his design, I still doubt that the design is\n&gt; as\n&gt;  good=\r\n as it could be, and I thought it might be of value to point that out,\n&gt;  a=\r\nnd perhaps even get an interesting discussion going on that issue. If I\n&gt;  =\r\nsounded patronizing that way, I appologize - that wasn&#39;t my intent.\n\nI ment=\r\nioned my design has a heirarchical structure and would like to\nhave my test=\r\ns also have a heirarchical structure for testing this\nbehavior easily.  Thi=\r\ns would help avoid lots of redundant coding and\nleads to cleaner & easy to =\r\nunderstand implementation.  I was using\njUnit (cactus based on this) but it=\r\n is found to be not meant for this.\n\nFine, alternates like ObjectMother (wh=\r\nich maintains heirarchical impl\nand single level tests classes just use the=\r\nm as helpers), TestNG were\nsuggested which is what I expected from this thr=\r\nead.  Also, it was\nmade clear that jUnit is not meant to do this, which is =\r\nabsolutely\nfine.\n\nExpecting OO behavior in test classes is a requirement wh=\r\nich I see for\nmy design at least.  I did not want to &#39;derail&#39; the discussio=\r\nn from\ntesting to making design changes and thatz why I made it clear that\n=\r\n&#39;letz not question the design&#39;.  Also someone was of the opinion that\ndeep =\r\nheirarchy could be a bad design..I wanted to step-in and say &#39;of\ncourse not=\r\n..it has it&#39;s own reason&#39;.\n  \n&gt;  &gt; In real life, faulty or imperfect design=\r\ns are the norm.\n&gt;  \n&gt;  Sure. That&#39;s one reason unit testing is so valuable:=\r\n it makes some of the\n&gt;  imperfectionism more visible, so that we can work =\r\non it.\n&#39;Faulty or imperfect design&#39;- well thatz not the case when we can&#39;t\n=\r\nuse jUnit for this purpose.  May be there are other tools which meets\nthis =\r\nneed.  Sometimes the app design might not provide interfaces to\nsuch a gran=\r\nular level that unit test might need.  It doesn&#39;t mean the\ndesign is imperf=\r\nect or sub-optimal.\n\n&gt;  &gt; If a framework forces you to change your design t=\r\no be useful,\n&gt;  &gt; you can bet that most companies will keep their design an=\r\nd\n&gt;  &gt; choose another framework.\n&gt;  \n&gt;  And some developers would rather ch=\r\noose a framework that is lightweight\n&gt; than\n&gt;  one that better supports sce=\r\nnarios they don&#39;t strive for anyway. It&#39;s nice\n&gt;  that we have a choice, is=\r\nn&#39;t it?\n&gt;  \n\nThe intent to bring this up is to know..\n1. Is this a common r=\r\nequirement and if yes, how is it handled?\n2. If not, what is the recommende=\r\nd way of doing this?\n3. tradeoffs, pros & cons of each of these approaches.=\r\n\n4. Any tools/framework which supports these.\n5. Real time experience on te=\r\nsting some of this kind..\n\nI wanted to provide nice examples for expressing=\r\n my need with a sample\ncode.  Also I would like to summarize things which I=\r\n have got out of\nthis discussion.  Becoz of lack of time I could not do tha=\r\nt so far.  I\nwill find time if someone really want to take this forward.\n\n~=\r\nJAK\n\n~JAK\n\n",
