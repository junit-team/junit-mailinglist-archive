    "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1006835707\">Hmmm...just to jump in the middle for a<br/>\nsecond...personally, I dislike unchecked exceptions. <br/>\nI used to like them, because, similar to your<br/>\nexperience, you could ignore them and not have the<br/>\nripple effect when refactoring.  However, I&#39;ve seen<br/>\nthis as an excuse to completely ignore the exception,<br/>\nin both testing and production.  Don&#39;t like that at<br/>\nall.  So, I&#39;ve decided to knuckle down and NOT use<br/>\nunchecked exceptions whenever possible.  This *forces*<br/>\nyou to handle them.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThat fact that you say using them allows the compiler<br/>\nto &#39;get in the way&#39; sounds like a non-issue.  Is this<br/>\ncoupling between your two systems?  Maybe...but I<br/>\n(personally) would rather have it and make damn sure<br/>\nthose exceptions are handled.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-Eric<br/>\n<br/>\n--- &quot;J. B.

If it ain&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the right exception, then the production code is<br/>\n&gt; barfing. Barfing is an<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; error -- different from, say, answering 10<br/>\n&gt; instead of 8.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; what about mixed language environment? I mean<br/>\n&gt; CORBA / Java or <br/>\n&gt; &gt; something like this... CORBA exceptions should be<br/>\n&gt; proccessed in Java,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  catched.... so I think checked exceptions are<br/>\n&gt; better, they AWARE <br/>\n&gt; &gt; programmers of majority of possible exception.<br/>\n&gt; They are part of <br/>\n&gt; &gt; method contracts. I FLAME :+)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I agree that checked exceptions give the compiler an<br/>\n&gt; opportunity to make <br/>\n&gt; people aware of exceptions that code expects to<br/>\n&gt; throw. Even so:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 1. I don&#39;t need the compiler to do all this work for<br/>\n&gt; me. Often it gets in my <br/>\n&gt; way.<br/>\n&gt; 2. When I refactor, I have to worry about the ripple<br/>\n&gt; effect of all these damn <br/>\n&gt; declared exceptions. Anything that makes refactoring<br/>\n&gt; difficult, tedious or <br/>\n&gt; annoying is, in my opinion, a Bad Thing unless it<br/>\n&gt; delivers real value in the <br/>\n&gt; meantime.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I am not convinced that, overall, the value<br/>\n&gt; delivered by checked exceptions <br/>\n&gt; is greater than the cost.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; On my current project, which of course includes<br/>\n&gt; database access, the entry <br/>\n&gt; point into the data access objects throws only<br/>\n&gt; unchecked exceptions. If our <br/>\n&gt; data access object encounters an SQLException, it<br/>\n&gt; wraps that in an <br/>\n&gt; ObjectStoreException. These are unexpected problems<br/>\n&gt; and catastrophic errors. <br/>\n&gt; When we throw an exception from within the data<br/>\n&gt; access object, we throw a <br/>\n&gt; subclass of ObjectStoreException, such as<br/>\n&gt; EntityNotFoundException, <br/>\n&gt; EntityInUseException, DuplicateEntityException. None<br/>\n&gt; of these exceptions are <br/>\n&gt; checked.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; We don&#39;t miss a thing. If we had checked exceptions<br/>\n&gt; everywhere, we would run <br/>\n&gt; the risk of coupling our service code with our data<br/>\n&gt; access code. Bad Thing.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Does the compiler have as much information to help<br/>\n&gt; us uncover unhandled <br/>\n&gt; exceptions? No. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; That&#39;s why we have tests. The compiler ain&#39;t so damn<br/>\n&gt; smart, anyhow.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --<br/>\n&gt; J. B.
