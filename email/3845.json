Remember that the point of JUnit is not to<br/>\nfunctionally test the software. It is to unit test it. Try to break down<br/>\nyour code into small testable pieces. By testing each piece you will have<br/>\ngreater control and more confidence that it will work once you put it<br/>\ntogether. It may not even be necessary to run the client and server at the<br/>\nsame time if you take this approach; the test case could act as the server<br/>\nfor testing the client and vice-versa. These are just a few thoughts -- the<br/>\ndetails of your particular program may prevent such an approach. But if you<br/>\nare testing your code from the very beginning you shouldn&#39;t have too much<br/>\ntrouble doing it.<br/>\n<br/>\nChris<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: guillaume_berche [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:guillaume.berche@...\">guillaume.berche@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Monday, January 21, 2002 8:49 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [junit] Junit support for non-standard distributed applications<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHello,<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m working on a Java layer implementing various communication <br/>\ninfrastructrure betwen processes based on raw TCP and UDP. I would <br/>\nlike to test it using Junit. However, this requires me to write a <br/>\ntest case which is distributed among many processes which act as <br/>\nclient/servers.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve looked into jakarta&#39;s cactus, and Junit EE but I understand they <br/>\nwould support only distributed applications based on standard <br/>\ncommunication protocols (namely HTTP and an EJB contained)<br/>\n<br/>\nIs there an extension to Junit that would support testing of non-<br/>\nstandard distributed applications?<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve started designing an RMI-based version of the junit interfaces <br/>\nwhere a testcase could spawn one or more &quot;distributed test cases&quot; <br/>\nrunning on remote hosts and that would report their status through <br/>\nthe originating test&#39;s TestListener. I&#39;m basically remotizing the <br/>\njunit interfaces.<br/>\n<br/>\nI wonder if such extension would already exist and if I could reuse <br/>\nit rather than redoing this from scratch. <br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for your help,<br/>\n<br/>\nGuillaume.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nTo unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\">junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nYour use of Yahoo!
