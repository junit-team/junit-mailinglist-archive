We are working on trying to red=\r\nuce the \noverheads for the JUnit tester as much as possible, as well as \npr=\r\novide an ANT task to run our tool, so people can tie it in with \ntheir ANT =\r\nbuilds.  \n\nI appreciate that purely for ad-hoc execution, then it can easil=\r\ny be \ndone via an IDE or the shell prompt, in which case this could be an \n=\r\nover engineered solution - so I can see your point of view. But as \nwell as=\r\n execution, we&#39;re aiming to provide something that will \nschedule automated=\r\n test runs and provide historical results for \ntheir test suites and each c=\r\nase executed etc.\n\nCheers,\nLes.\n\n\n",
