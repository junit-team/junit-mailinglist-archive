If\nyou r=\r\nequire TDD in your project, you should resign yourself to the fact\nthat you=\r\n will have to train the prospects on what you mean by that and\nwhat level o=\r\nf testing you require even under deadline.  The sad truth is\nthat many proj=\r\nects claim to be &quot;agile&quot; only so they can throw away the\nmost fundamental e=\r\nngineering practices (like CM, much less testing).\nThe later a project is, =\r\nthe more they will look to throw away what they\nreally feel are unnecessary=\r\n practices, or barriers to progress.\nFundamental CM and project management =\r\nwill work with the client to\nadjust scope or deadline, but we won&#39;t go ther=\r\ne for the moment.\n\nWhat I&#39;ve found as a result of this phenomenon is that t=\r\nhe vast majority\nof people I interview have no concept of unit testing, muc=\r\nh less TDD.\nThat doesn&#39;t mean that the people are bad resources.  It just m=\r\neans that\nunit testing hasn&#39;t saved their bacon yet, and they haven&#39;t been\n=\r\nrequired to stick to it long enough for that to happen.  What that means\nis=\r\n that I have to build time into my schedule to teach how unit testing\nworks=\r\n, and how TDD works.  I&#39;ll relax the requirement for the tests to\nbe writte=\r\nn first for these folks, as long as the tests get written.\nPart of the trai=\r\nning progress is showing them where they are either\nwriting too much code, =\r\nor not enough tests.\n\nI tend to focus on the more critical aspects of troub=\r\nleshooting skills,\nand determining if their claimed skills are just paper t=\r\nhin.  After that\nI check their willingness to do TDD.  My assumption is tha=\r\nt I&#39;m going to\nhave to teach them.  Running these engineering tests are onl=\r\ny necessary\nwhen you are dealing with junior positions.\n\n-----Original Mess=\r\nage-----\nFrom: junit@yahoogroups.com [mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com] On Beha=\r\nlf Of\nKent Beck\nSent: Monday, May 03, 2010 7:59 PM\nTo: junit@...=\r\nm\nSubject: Re: [junit] When it matters most, don&#39;t forget your tests.\n\nTo t=\r\nhe OP, I think you forgot TDD because you&#39;re human. Hard to cure,\nbut perfe=\r\nctly understandable :-)\n\nTo all, if you expect developers to use TDD in the=\r\nir work, it makes\nperfect sense to ask them to demonstrate it in an intervi=\r\new. There are a\nwide range of TDD skills (working on TDD screencasts at the=\r\n moment\ncontinually reminds both how much I know and how very much I don&#39;t)=\r\n. If\nyou are pressed for time, you might be able to get some good informati=\r\non\nby asking them to list the tests they would write for a given problem\nin=\r\nstead of actually coding.\n\nRegards,\n\nKent\n\nOn May 1, 2010, at 12:54 PM, Den=\r\nnis Lloyd Jr wrote:\n\n&gt; Hi Mike,\n&gt; I think it&#39;s interesting that under the &quot;=\r\nheat&quot; of an interview, TDD\n&gt; practices get dumped. The same seems to happen=\r\n to many developers\nunder the\n&gt; heat of a challenging deadline. When I inte=\r\nrviewed candidates in the\npast, I\n&gt; pay close attention to if they mention =\r\nTDD or automated unit testing.\nIf\n&gt; they don&#39;t mention it themselves, I ask=\r\n. That is because I believe it\nis one\n&gt; of most important (perhaps THE most=\r\n important) development skills. I\nalso\n&gt; ask a lot of questions regarding t=\r\nest case identification.\n&gt; \n&gt; It has been a long time since I was on an int=\r\nerview which asked me to\nwrite\n&gt; code. However, the last interview I was on=\r\n, I was presented with a\ncode\n&gt; sample and asked what was wrong with it. It=\r\n was a single function,\nspanning\n&gt; three printed pages, with a &quot;bug&quot; somewh=\r\nere in it. I told the\ninterviewer\n&gt; that the problem was there were no unit=\r\n tests, and the code was not\nclearly\n&gt; written - after fixing those two thi=\r\nngs, the bug should be obvious.\n&gt; \n&gt; It&#39;s easy to forget these things durin=\r\ng an interview. Developer\ninterviews\n&gt; that I have seen tend to focus on sp=\r\necific developer experiences, such\nas\n&gt; familiarity with specific languages=\r\n or technologies, or knowledge of a\n&gt; certain domain. It is easy for the in=\r\nterviewer and candidate to get\nlost in\n&gt; these details and forget good prac=\r\ntices. I think this focus is\ngenerally a\n&gt; mistake. I think the focus shoul=\r\nd be on demonstrating experience with\ngood\n&gt; development practices, good de=\r\nsign, testing, well-written code, along\nwith a\n&gt; desire to learn and grow a=\r\ns a developer on a team.\n&gt; \n&gt; Cheers,\n&gt; Dennis\n&gt; \n&gt; On Sat, May 1, 2010 at =\r\n9:17 AM, Mike Forsberg &lt;bigmike.f@...&gt;\nwrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; This may=\r\n be better in a blog post, which I will hopefully get to...\n&gt; &gt; but I&#39;d lik=\r\ne to pose two questions to the group first. Let&#39;s call it\n&gt; &gt; research.\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;ve just completed a set of interviews and looking back on the\ncoding=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; questions. I realized that I never followed my test first mantra\nthat\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; I perform at home.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; First question, to those giving the intervie=\r\nw... Would you ever\n&gt; &gt; suggest/remind a candidate of TDD style in his/her =\r\ncode?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Second question, why on earth does a candidate, like myself, =\r\nforget\nto\n&gt; &gt; write tests and incrementally improve their code? Do this sho=\r\nw a\nlack\n&gt; &gt; of software development maturity?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; As a community remin=\r\nder, and to myself.... don&#39;t forget TDD style on\n&gt; &gt; interviews.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n\n[Non-tex=\r\nt portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\n--------------------------=\r\n----------\n\nYahoo!
