We are pleased to inform you that\nZephyr has come out with its new and enhanced version Zephyr v3.0\n&lt;http://www.getzephyr.com/&gt; , where quality intelligence meets\ncomprehensive test management.\n\nWhat&#39;s New in Zephyr v3.0?\n\n    *\nCustom reports generator: Zephyr&#39;s new custom report generator makes it\nsimple for every team to be able to run any report they need. The new\nfunctionality builds on the existing out of the box functionality which\ncomes with more than 16 drill down reports and metrics.\n\n    *\nExtensive API&#39;s: Zephyr&#39;s philosophy has always been to integrate\nwith existing infrastructure and not force teams to rip one tool out to\nreplace it with another. With the new extensive API&#39;s Zephyr further\nextends the capability of its platform to support the myriad needs of\nglobal software quality teams. The web services API&#39;s are fully\ndocumented at http://developer.yourzephyr.com\n&lt;http://developer.yourzephyr.com/&gt;\n\n    *\nEnhanced productivity levels/Search Technology: Zephyr&#39;s test management\nsolution promotes a new level of organization at the release, project,\ndepartment and global level. With the 3.0 release, Zephyr debuts a new\nsearch technology that searches in the body of fields, not just in the\ntitle or subject field. Teams will achieve new levels of productivity\n\n    *\nTrend reporting: With Zephyr&#39;s new, first of its kind dynamic trend\nreports, teams now have the ability to look back at stages of former\nprojects and quantify how long it took to complete the release. With\nthis information in hand, the same teams will now able to plan\naccordingly for not only current releases, but also for future projects.\n\n    *\nEnhanced JIRA integration: Zephyr enhances its one of a kind 2-way JIRA\nintegration by supporting JIRA custom fields. Teams have always been\nable to enter, search, change, report, analyze and close any defect in\nJIRA from within Zephyr through optimized testing desktops. With the new\nrelease, teams who have customized or plan to customize JIRA will also\nbe able to leverage the robust functionality and achieve higher\nproductivity and efficiencies.\n\n\nWe&#39;d love to hear your opinion about Zephyr v3.0 and will be glad to\nshare more information with you.
