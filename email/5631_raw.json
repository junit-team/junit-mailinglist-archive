From that\nperspective I&#39;m uninterested in negative test cases beyond the narrow confines of\nmy model (talking formally), which is thus much more tractable than dealing with\nthe real world!\n\nThanks,\n\nToby\n\n\nVladimir Bossicard wrote:\n\n&gt; &gt; I was interested about the idea that JUnit might not be the best\n&gt; &gt; tool for testing negative test cases.\n&gt;\n&gt; To make sure that we are talking about the same subject, I define &#39;negative\n&gt; testing&#39; as making sure that the software (library in our case) is not doing\n&gt; what it is not supposed to do.  In other words, that your system can handle\n&gt; incorrect or inappropriate information.  Examples are:\n&gt;\n&gt; - calling a method with wrong arguments (null, boundaries...)\n&gt; - wrong type of String (numeric instead of text, wrong date format...)\n&gt; - partial initialization of members\n&gt; - methods called in no particular order (may reveal unstable state)\n&gt; - ...\n&gt;\n&gt; the problem with negative testing is that it&#39;s endless.  It&#39;s hard to test what\n&gt; a system can do but even harder to test what it can&#39;t.\n&gt;\n&gt; It&#39;s possible to use JUnit to write negative tests (like testing exceptions)\n&gt; but if you have 1,000 classes and you want to test that each method of every\n&gt; class handles &#39;null&#39; arguments correctly... well it&#39;s going to take a while.\n&gt;\n&gt; That&#39;s why I think that JUnit is not the best suited for heavy negative testing\n&gt; but if you come with some kind of automated testing, I&#39;ll be more than happy to\n&gt; change my mind :-)\n&gt;\n&gt; Other opinions/feedback out there?\n&gt;\n&gt; -Vladimir\n&gt;\n&gt; --\n&gt; Vladimir Bossicard\n&gt; www.bossicard.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
