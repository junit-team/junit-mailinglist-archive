If the candidate complains that it&#39;s not their\nIDE/editor =\r\nof choice, that should send up a flag. Granted this is my ideal\nenvironment=\r\n.\n\nWhat about a 2 stage interview? One where they write the tests for a alr=\r\neady\nexisting piece of code (maybe to increase the codes functionality), th=\r\nen\nanother where they try and write code to get the tests to pass.  Granted=\r\n\nthis is not testing if they actually use TDD, but it would show if they ha=\r\nve\nthe skill.  Maybe forcing the iteration process of test -&gt; functionality=\r\n -&gt;\ntest -&gt; functionality will show if they have the skill.\n\nI think spendi=\r\nng some time, 2-3 hours with a machine, later in the interview\nprocess, say=\r\n after a phone screen, maybe second round of face to face, might\npay divide=\r\nnds in the quality of people on a team.  Then again it might\ndepend on how =\r\nskilled you need this individual to be.\n\nThanks for the input,\n\nBig Mike\n\n\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt;\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n",
