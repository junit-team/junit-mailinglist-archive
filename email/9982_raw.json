You&#39;ll be able \n&gt; to extend the abstract class and provi=\r\nde all getters and \n&gt; setters and setup the data you need. There will be AP=\r\nI for \n&gt; finders, ejbSelects, etc. So you would not even need the \n&gt; databa=\r\nse to test it. The goal here is to focus on testing the \n&gt; business logic, =\r\nnot the container-generated SQL. \n\nI see.  Sounds like a good way to do it!=\r\n\n \n&gt; I have not seen the official statistics but I suspect that \n&gt; the usag=\r\ne of CMP is on the rise. It is supported by all major \n&gt; vendors ( can&#39;t sa=\r\ny the same about JDO ) and for many \n&gt; project/organizations that pay big b=\r\nucks for their app server \n&gt; licenses it is all that matter. So in many cas=\r\nes it&#39;s not the \n&gt; choice of CMP vs. Hibernate vs. JDO but CMP vs. roll you=\r\nr \n&gt; own. Naturally, CMP wins in this case. \n\nYes, I guess everyone&#39;s milea=\r\nge varies.  For us, CMP isn&#39;t yet portable enough by itself.  J2EE guarante=\r\nss a minimum level of portable features (so far), so you end up needing to =\r\nleverage vendor-specific CMP enhancements, such as auto-incrementing primar=\r\ny keys (IIRC).  But these are dependent on special features or specific dat=\r\nabases and deployment descriptors, and pretty soon you need a separate code=\r\nbase for each vendor.\n\n&gt; http://www.mockejb.org\n&gt; EJBs made easy\n\nThis is c=\r\nool.  I will check it out!\n\nThanks,\nScott Stirling\nWorkscape, Inc.\n\n&gt;   ---=\r\n-- Original Message ----- \n&gt;   From: Stirling, Scott \n&gt; \n&gt;   &gt; Alexander An=\r\naniev wrote:\n&gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt; There is no reason why CMP entity beans can&#39;t run=\r\n outside of the \n&gt;   &gt; container. \n&gt; \n&gt;   In EJB 2.0, CMPs are abstract cla=\r\nsses implemented by the \n&gt; app server.  How would you test these in any mea=\r\nningful way?  \n&gt; Even the SQL is generated in most cases.
