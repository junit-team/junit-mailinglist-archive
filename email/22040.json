It was<br/>\nreally strange because the tests from other modules were running but these<br/>\nweren&#39;t (and they all shared the same dependencies).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe root of the problem was that the test classes were named something other<br/>\nthan the standard, so instead of having MyClassTest.java, they were named<br/>\nMyClassTester.java (I didn&#39;t create them). Once I changed them to the<br/>\nformer, they all ran like they were supposed to.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, I do think this might be a bug in the maven-surefire-plugin code.<br/>\nWhen using annotations, it shouldn&#39;t matter what the class is named,<br/>\nsurefire should be able to &quot;introspect&quot; all methods that are annotated with<br/>\n@Test.<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess I could also try to modify the pom to find &#39;**/*Tester.java&#39; classes<br/>\nfor testing, but I try to avoid explicitly setting things as much as I can.<br/>\n<br/>\nRegards,<br/>\n-- <br/>\nView this message in context: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://old.nabble.com/maven2-with-Junit-4-ignores-%40Test-annotations-tp17548499p26125017.html\">http://old.nabble.com/maven2-with-Junit-4-ignores-%40Test-annotations-tp17548499p26125017.html</a><br/>\nSent from the JUnit - User mailing list archive at Nabble.com.</div>",
