Rainsberger\n&lt;jbrains@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Here is a &quot;ten-second review&quot; from diasparsoftware.com:\n&gt; \n&gt; Mike Clark&#39;s latest book, Pragmatic Project Automation is an excellent\n&gt; survey of project automation techniques. Using tools we know and love,\n&gt; he shows us how to automate more than just our tests: he includes\n&gt; sections on building, testing, deploying and monitoring our software.\n&gt; Especially interesting are the presentations of Groovy as an alternative\n&gt; to Ant buildfiles and techniques for monitoring applications while they\n&gt; run. Mike shows us just some of what we can automate on a project, and\n&gt; if we did that much, we&#39;d be rather ahead of the game. I am putting this\n&gt; in my bag for my next project, and we will use the techniques the moment\n&gt; the need for automation becomes apparent. I suspect that will happen\n&gt; quickly. An excellent, quick read. Informative, pragmatic, and a source\n&gt; of other good ideas.\n&gt; \n&gt; Please order your copy directly from the publisher at\n&gt; \n&gt;      http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/sk/auto/\n&gt; \n&gt; Take care.\n&gt; --\n&gt; J.
