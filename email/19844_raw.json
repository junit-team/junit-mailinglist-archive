I believe that mixing languages\nrather than switching completely from one language to another is going\nto be more and more important. As I explored the subject i found\nmyself lacking some tools. I was frustrated by the fact that I had to\nmaintain two sets of tests and look for feedback in two different\nlocations while developing.\n\nI created a custom runner for JUnit to address the subject and I think\nit looks promising. I created a blog entry with some more details in\ncase anyone is interested:\n\nhttp://johlrogge.wordpress.com/2007/09/08/hybrid-theory/\n&lt;http://johlrogge.wordpress.com/2007/09/08/hybrid-theory/&gt; \n\nI have some loose plans on open-sourcing this but I would like to see\nif there are others than me that find this interesting enough to be\nworth the effort before I do.\n\n/Joakim Ohlrogge\n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n",
