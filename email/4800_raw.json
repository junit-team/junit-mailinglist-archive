Sometimes this is a viable \noption, but at some point a directory full of a bunch of xml catalog \nfile variations becomes more readable and understandable than a bunch of \ncode.  You want to find a medium that works for your situation, rather \nthan trying too hard to make your situation fit a set of rules.\n\nT.\n\nOn Wednesday, May 1, 2002, at 05:30 PM, David V. Olivier wrote:\n\n&gt; The rule of thumb is that unit tests should be as standalone as \n&gt; possible,\n&gt; and dependencies on external resources such as databases or files \n&gt; should be\n&gt; minimized or eliminated.  This makes perfect sense.  Tests which rely on\n&gt; external resources are  not self-contained, are harder to read, and can \n&gt; be\n&gt; broken even if the code is functioning correctly.  However, code does \n&gt; touch\n&gt; external resources at some point.  Shouldn&#39;t this be tested, and how?\n&gt;\n&gt; Specifically, I have code that parses a xml catalog file and builds a\n&gt; catalog object structure.  I want to verify that the parsing works\n&gt; correctly.  In particular, I want to make sure that it robustly handles\n&gt; unusual conditions such as catalogs with certain branches missing.  It\n&gt; seems to me that the simplest way to do this is to have a test which \n&gt; uses\n&gt; the parsing code to parse a very simple catalog and verifies that it \n&gt; builds\n&gt; what I expect it to.\n&gt;\n&gt; But to do this test I do need some external resource, a simple catalog\n&gt; file.  Ok.  Now I can&#39;t simply look at the test to see what it does.  I\n&gt; also have to look at the file.  Are there cleaner alternatives?  Must I\n&gt; simply accept that there will occasionally be external resources \n&gt; required\n&gt; to test functionality at the boundaries of the system?  If so, are there\n&gt; best practices for this scenario?  Am I missing something?  I&#39;d love to\n&gt; hear peoples thoughts.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; David Olivier\n&gt; Naval Research Laboratory\n&gt; Digital Mapping, Charting & Geodesy Analysis Program\n&gt; Code 7440.2\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
