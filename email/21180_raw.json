I \n&gt; mirror NUnit 2.5 there and have several related projects \n&gt; hosted. NUnit  3.0 will be moving there. The VCS on Launchpad \n&gt; is bazaar.\n&gt; \n&gt; The main attraction of Launchpad to me was their stated goal \n&gt; of making it very easy for people to contribute to projects. \n&gt; Anyone who wants to create a branch of a project in their \n&gt; private space on launchpad can do so and then propose the \n&gt; change for merging into the trunk. Of course,C the project \n&gt; team has control over what they accept.\n&gt; \n&gt; While working on such a branch, the potential contributor has \n&gt; all the services of a source code management system available \n&gt; to them on their own machine and can push updates to a \n&gt; published branch on Launchpad. Regular contributors or team \n&gt; members can do the same thing and you can use your main \n&gt; branch (trunk) like a centralized repository if you prefer, \n&gt; while still having the benefits of a distributed system where \n&gt; you need it. Code review is integrated in the process.\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m still in the stage of learning to use LP and bzr, and \n&gt; there could still be glitches, but both are under active \n&gt; development and the underlying philosophy matches what I&#39;d \n&gt; like to do. I suspect it&#39;s a philosophical match you as well. \n&gt; I spent some time searching and couldn&#39;t find anything about \n&gt; banning any countries there.\n&gt; \n&gt; Launchpad, btw, is sponsored by Canonical, and it&#39;s where \n&gt; Ubuntu is developed, so it focuses on an international \n&gt; audience and has a platform for localization as well.\n&gt;  \n&gt; I suggest taking the tour at http://launchpad.net/+tour/index \n&gt; if this sounds at all interesting.\n&gt; \n&gt; Charlie\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; &gt; From: junit@yahoogroups.com [mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com] \n&gt; On Behalf \n&gt; &gt; Of David Saff\n&gt; &gt; Sent: Tuesday, December 09, 2008 11:07 AM\n&gt; &gt; To: junit@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; &gt; Subject: Re: [junit] Would JUnit moving to Subversion and/or Google \n&gt; &gt; Code have consequences for you?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Actually, it appears that JUnit has already been somewhat \n&gt; blocked from \n&gt; &gt; Cuba:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SourceForge#Banned_countries\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; So now we have three variables to control:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 1) Code review ease\n&gt; &gt; 2) Source control ease\n&gt; &gt; 3) Worldwide access\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Does anyone know for sure if there&#39;s a hosting solution that scores \n&gt; &gt; 100% on Worldwide Access?  Does anyone know what the restrictions \n&gt; &gt; involve?  (I wonder if it&#39;s something to do with SSL \n&gt; connections from \n&gt; &gt; countries to which, theoretically, you can&#39;t export SSL-enabling \n&gt; &gt; technology, or couldn&#39;t at one point--I&#39;m very rusty on this).\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; It appears that if we allow browsing the documentation and \n&gt; downloading \n&gt; &gt; through junit.org, and other services through Google Code, we&#39;d be \n&gt; &gt; offering the same level of worldwide access we are now.  Is \n&gt; that true?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;    David Saff\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; On Tue, Dec 9, 2008 at 12:45 PM, kentb &lt;kentb@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;   Very interesting. That doesn&#39;t align with my values. \n&gt; Still, David \n&gt; &gt; &gt; and I would like a less-synchronous-but-still-connected style of \n&gt; &gt; &gt; development.
