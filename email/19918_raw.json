A testing framework s=\r\nhould\n&gt; &gt; provide this case, without using another one library.\n&gt; \n&gt; Now yo=\r\nu&#39;re making the hard assumption: that what you&#39;re doing is \n&gt; commonly need=\r\ned. A framework of any kind should solve common \nproblems \n&gt; and leave unus=\r\nual ones to extensions. This is the difference \nbetween \n&gt; &quot;framework&quot; and =\r\n&quot;platform&quot;.\n\nDear J.B. Rainsberger,\n\nIt is a metter of opinion, the questio=\r\nn is simple: =BFCan I change \ndinamically during a jUnit test the classpath=\r\n?\n\nThe answer you provide instead of saying NO, :-) is: use Ant. =BFWhy?\n\nU=\r\nnder jUnit, I can modify life cicle of the running process in order \nto mak=\r\ne tests, why not to let the user to alter also some \nconfiguration informat=\r\nion for example: classpath (and probably it is \npossible, specifying some c=\r\nlass loader mechanism, but I am not an \nexpert on that)\n\nI don&#39;t like test =\r\nthat depends on IDE&#39;s, because when the project \ngrows up you end up that i=\r\ns much better to run them under console, \nthat is why I don&#39;t like to assum=\r\ne specific location of Eclipse \nclasspath.\n\nThanks any way for your interes=\r\nt,\n\nDavid\n\n\n&gt; \n&gt;      http://tinyurl.com/2blcuz\n&gt; -- \n&gt; J.
