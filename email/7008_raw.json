But, with TDD\nmy code is 90-100% tested whereas otherwise it would\nbe 10% (if that).  That is such a marked improvement\nthat I think it is well worth it, even without\nindependent testing.\n\n---- Lauren Bish wrote: -----\nI should have added that I find it useful to have both\nTDD and Unit \ntesting\nthat is done by a dedicated unit tester. Not many\ndevelopers have the \nproper\nattitude for testing; testing takes a somewhat\ndestructive attitude, \nwhile\nwriting code is a creative process. Also, many\ndevelopers don&#39;t have \nthe\naptitude or expertise for testing. This is not a slam\non developers, \njust a\nrecognition that testing and developing (both of which\nI have done) are \ntwo\ndifferent areas of expertise.\n\n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
