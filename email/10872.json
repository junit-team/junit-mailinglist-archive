I am<br/>\n&gt; running several .class tests in my suite() and I would like to have<br/>\n&gt; some flexibility as far as running different subsets of tests. I have<br/>\n&gt; created a &quot;TestClient&quot; with a main that collects command line<br/>\n&gt; arguments to know what subset of parametrized tests to run. I&#39;d also<br/>\n&gt; like to include &quot;levels&quot; of testing. Basically, I&#39;d like to be able<br/>\n&gt; to run certain sets of tests based on a command line parameter.<br/>\n&gt; eg.) java TestClient &lt;-detailed | -normal | -brief &gt;<br/>\n&gt; The only option I can seem to think of is to have the suite add tests<br/>\n&gt; by methodName and do so conditionally (based on a static global<br/>\n&gt; variable).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; if(detailed){<br/>\n&gt;    suite.addTest(newTestClient(&quot;testItemA&quot;))<br/>\n&gt; }<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The problem with this is that I&#39;d have to list every single<br/>\n&gt; testMethod for the test. Instead, I&#39;d like to add the tests to the<br/>\n&gt; suite as .class files and use any another approach. Can anyone think<br/>\n&gt; of anything? Any suggestions out there?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It sounds like you could reuse the Ant &lt;junit&gt;/&lt;batchtest&gt; tags somehow. <br/>\nCould you rebuild your TestClient to run Ant in embedded mode and <br/>\ngeneral a target on the fly? I&#39;ve never tried it, but it might be very <br/>\nsimple. Ask around on Ant mailing lists about invoking Ant tasks <br/>\nprogrammatically.<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJ. B.
