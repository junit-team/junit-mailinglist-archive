I just received the book in my hands for the first time a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; few days ago.  Unfortunately, Amazon<br/>\n&gt; &gt; doesn&#39;t have its description info yet, but we have a link on the Object<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Mentor website:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.objectmentor.com/resources/bookstore/books/welc/\">http://www.objectmentor.com/resources/bookstore/books/welc/</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;ll add a sample chapter to files section of this yahoo group too.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Congratulations! What a great feeling, eh?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>So true!  The samples file is up there now.  There were some changes <br/>\nbefore that went to production.  Nothing major that I remember.  The <br/>\nchapter I put up contains a bunch of different scenarios that show how <br/>\nto instantiate difficult classes in test harnesses.  The examples are in <br/>\nJava, C++, and C#, but not terribly idiomatic.  I hope you all find them <br/>\nuseful.<br/>\n<br/>\nMichael Feathers<br/>\nwww.objectmentor.com</div>",
