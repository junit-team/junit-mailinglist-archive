If there aren&#39;t many fixes that needed to be integrated, how\n&gt;  &gt; much\n&gt;  &gt; of a problem is it?\n&gt; \n&gt; Depends on the seriousness of the problem.  Sure, you can rely on\n&gt; everyone to implement workarounds or their own fixes (e.g.\n&gt; testrunners), but what&#39;s the point?  Why leave the broken things broken\n&gt; at all?\n&gt; \n&gt; I don&#39;t see how bug fixes have anything at all to do with featuritis. \n&gt; To me it simply seems that the SF project is dead (certainly no one\n&gt; seems to be managing bug reports, even if the RFE forum is considered a\n&gt; bit bucket).\n\nIf we were to get the problems fixed without adding new features, would \nthat be helpful? or would we all just then start crying for the \nfeatures?
