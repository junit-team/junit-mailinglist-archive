It is\n&gt; a requirement of our tests that they continue to run\n&gt; after the first assertion fails.  We don&#39;t want\n&gt; fatal asserts in other words.  We would like to\n&gt; capture the results of all the assertions.  The\n&gt; current way JUnit functions is to fail out of the\n&gt; test at the first failed assertion.  This\n&gt; contradicts the requirement of our tests.  The\n&gt; junit3.7b.jar file available in the article Mike\n&gt; sent seems to solve our problem.

I am in a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; situation where I require one test case to have\n&gt; &gt; &gt; multiple assertions.  If one of these assertions\n&gt; &gt; &gt; fails, I still need the others to run.
