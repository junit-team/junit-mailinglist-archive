If you want to know whether your candidate can actually do TDD (as claimed on their resume), then there&#39;s only one good way to find out. And a candidate that started by testing all the exotic failure states, rather than working through the most useful features, would have revealed that they probably don&#39;t understand incremental development.<br/>\n<br/>\nS.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On 1 May 2010, at 23:53, Cédric Beust ♔ wrote:<br/>\n&gt; I think asking candidates to do TDD in an interview is a waste of time.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; You have about forty-five minutes to find out how good that candidate is and<br/>\n&gt; if you ask her to solve a problem and to begin by writing tests the TDD way,<br/>\n&gt; you&#39;ll waste fifteen minutes seeing code that tests for easy cases, nulls<br/>\n&gt; and exceptions.  Not exactly enlightening.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I prefer to focus on coding problems and possibly mentioning tests and<br/>\n&gt; hearing what they have to say about it.  It&#39;s also perfectly okay with me if<br/>\n&gt; all they talk about is &quot;automated&quot; tests and not TDD, I don&#39;t think that TDD<br/>\n&gt; is a requirement to write good tests, nor does it tell me much about how<br/>\n&gt; good that candidate is.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSteve Freeman<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.growing-object-oriented-software.com\">http://www.growing-object-oriented-software.com</a> </span></blockquote></div>",
