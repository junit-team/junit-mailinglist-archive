What are the possibilities ?\n&gt;         Would simply moving the =\r\nTestCase as inner\n&gt;         class suite the matter.\n\nThis would solve the p=\r\nroblem in some ways, in that you could access the\nprivate and friendly meth=\r\nods, but but in other ways it&#39;s not optimal.\nIncluding the testing code in =\r\nthe same class as the production code both\nbloats your production code and =\r\ncreates a direct dependancy on JUnit,\nmeaning that when you ship the code y=\r\nou have to either creatively strip out\nthe unit test class files with Ant w=\r\nhen you ship, or ship JUnit with it. \n\nIn the case of this certification, (=\r\nwhich I recently passed myself, btw), I\nthink it would mean that you would =\r\nhave to submit JUnit with your code in\norder that the examiner would be abl=\r\ne to compile it. I don&#39;t think the rules\nof the exam allow you to submit co=\r\nde that you havn&#39;t written, or introduce\ndependancies on 3rd party products=\r\n. I got round it myself by submitting the\ntest code as &quot;developer documenta=\r\ntion&quot; and not including the JUnit jar, just\na note to download it if the ex=\r\naminer wanted to compile or run the tests.\nNeedless to say I got 20/20 for =\r\ndocumentation :-)\n\n&gt;     2=B0. Am I&#39;m better to make all the TestCases memb=\r\ner\n&gt;         of the package of the class to test & make the accessor\n&gt;     =\r\n    protected ?\n&gt; \n\nI personally think this is a better approach - put the =\r\ntests in the same\npackage but in a different source tree, and make the meth=\r\nods package or\nprotected level. I think someone else mentioned that Ant mak=\r\nes that easier\nto handle. Of course probably the best approach of all has a=\r\nlready been\noutlined - make the methods public on another class that you ca=\r\nn test. I&#39;ve\npersonally found though that it&#39;s not always obvious how to do=\r\n that, and it\nis useful to be able to test package and protected methods.\n\n=\r\nhope that helps,\n\nEmily\n\n",
