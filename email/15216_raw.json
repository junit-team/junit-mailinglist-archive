For me, it works (and runs the code!) when\n&gt; rerunning individual test method instances /that were found using\n&gt; the standard TestSuite(TestCase) constructor/.  But for dynamically\n&gt; generated test cases, it doesn&#39;t rerun them.  Looks like an Eclipse\n&gt; bug to me.\n\nJeff,\n\nI&#39;m a little uncomfortable calling it a bug.  Since JUnit 3 allows fully \ndynamic test tree generation, it can be undecidable in advance whether a \ngiven test case will even be included in the suite that is run, and more \ndifficult than that to actually dynamically reconstruct the test case \nalone without running the rest of the suite.\n\nEclipse will work correctly rerunning tests on suites made up of \nTestCases and TestSuites constructed in the usual way, such as \nsuite.addTestCase(MyTest.class).  This seems to be a good way to cover \n80% of what users want.  Is there another JUnit 3 pattern so prevalent \nthat addressing it would up that coverage to 90%?\n\nOne cool thing about JUnit 4 is that while you should be able to do \narbitrary test-creation cleverness using the @RunWith annotation, this \nis a static annotation that IDE&#39;s can easily check.  So version 17.1 of \nsome IDE might be able to rerun tests run with TestClassRunner (JUnit 4 \ndefault) and OldTestClassRunner (JUnit 3 default), and if it turns out a \nlot of people are using Parameterized, 17.2 could add support for that.\n\nHope that helps,\n\n    David Saff\n\n",
