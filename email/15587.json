TestNG isn&#39;t just<br/>\n&gt; used for unit tests, it&#39;s used for all sorts of tests including<br/>\n&gt; long-running integration tests. TDD doesn&#39;t really apply there,<br/>\n&gt; because the window may well be several hours.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Using dependencies (of some form) to prevent long-running tests from<br/>\n&gt; running when you know they will (probably) fail anyway is a good idea.<br/>\n&gt; However, it doesn&#39;t assist the developer at the point where they need<br/>\n&gt; to diagnose failure that much.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; This is, of course, why serious JUnit developers focus on dividing<br/>\n&gt; tests into fast and slow. :) It&#39;s also why we don&#39;t tend to see a need<br/>\n&gt; for other categories.<br/>\n&gt;   <br/>\n </span></blockquote>  By the way, continuous integration servers (such as CruiseControl) <br/>\nwould generate a nice report that include failed tests along with the <br/>\nlist of the changed sources. That may not scale well for a massive code <br/>\nchange but still provide a good help to find a starting point... or <br/>\nnarrow down list of guilty developers. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n  regards,<br/>\n  Eugene<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",
