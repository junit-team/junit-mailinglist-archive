I now\nbelieve that was mistakenly complex, given the size and agility that\nwe should be able to maintain.  So, I have simplified matters.  All\nnew pull requests, in general should go directly against\nKentBeck/master.\n\nWhen it comes time to cut a release branch, I will introduce a new\nbranch with the release version number (i.e., 4.10).  The only pull\nrequests that should go against the release branch should be for\nregression bugs found during beta testing.\n\nThanks,\n\n   David Saff\n\n",
