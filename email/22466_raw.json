Now Ant, Maven, and other build\ntools collect all the test classes and execute them.  Essentially, the\nusefulness of test Suites has been greatly diminished.  The problem that\nthe build tools answered quite nicely was the fact that manually\nmaintaining the test suites can be a problem.  People routinely forget\nto add test classes to the test suites, and it&#39;s not a question of\nlaziness.  It&#39;s just a question of it being that &quot;one more thing&quot; to\nremember that is so easily overlooked.\n\nThe Categories test runner provides a nice extension to Suites that give\nthem some value again.  However, I&#39;d like to make use of them without\nexplicitly listing all the classes included in the suite.  Essentially,\nI&#39;d either like the Categories test runner to collect all the test\nclasses itself and apply the category filters, or have that built into\nthe main JUnit runner.  Adding support for a class collector is\npossible, and may even be preferable in today&#39;s testing.\n\nCurrently some projects keep unit tests, slow tests, and installation\ntests in separate directory structures so that Ant or whatever build\ntool they choose can run them separately.  Categories will allow these\nprojects to clearly mark the tests, possibly even assigning multiple\ncategories to the tests.  This provides great flexibility in how things\nare run.\n\nOf course, this includes corresponding support in ANT to execute the\nproper categories, or at the very least call the Categories test suites\nwe&#39;ve set up.  Since JUnit takes care of collecting the classes for us,\nit makes leveraging that support as simple as calling a single test case\nwhich all the build tools already support.\n\nWhat thoughts do you have on this?\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n",
