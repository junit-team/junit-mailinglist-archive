You could read the principle of YAGNI as\n&gt; saying don&#39;t pay for the flexibility until you know you need it.  If I\n&gt; don&#39;t have any real reason to believe that I&#39;m likely to swap in a new\n&gt; algorithm later, then moving the algorithm into its own class could be\n&gt; seen as overkill.  (There are still, however, plenty of reasons to\n&gt; encapsulate it in its own method, like readability and coherence.)\n\nRemember: YAGNI means you shouldn&#39;t invest in *functionality* you just don&#39;t\nneed for now; it shouldn&#39;t be used for excuses to not try to get the best\n(most readable/maintainable) design for the funtionality you just need.\n\n&gt; Moving it into its own class does buy you something in simplifying the\n&gt; testing, though, so is that (up-front, immediate) benefit sufficient\n&gt; to justify the cost of the pattern?\n\nAs you pointed out above, there may be other benefits. Test-first\nprogramming is not only a testing strategy, but also (if not mainly) a\ndesign strategy. If you find something hard to test, it *may* be an\nindicator that the design needs to be improved.\n\nciao, Ilja\n\n\n",
