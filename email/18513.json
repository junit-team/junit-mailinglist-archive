Cedric&#39;s statement seems to assume that both <br/>\n&gt; generics and static typing are a good thing. I dislike generics (I type <br/>\n&gt; more to get a little more protection) and I don&#39;t find static typing<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Jmock 2.0 (still in cvs only) incorporates static typing (hence refactor <br/>\nsafe) with the jmock style. <br/>\n<br/>\nNat, Steve, (if you are listening) if you make a beta release I would <br/>\ncertainly try it out at work and I suspect others would as well. <br/>\n<br/>\n - Neil</div>",
