I tend to look at them more as<br/>\nprinciples that I try to follow. I think Kent Beck wrote in his book &quot;Test<br/>\ndriven development&quot; that the important thing is not to take teeny tiny steps<br/>\nbut to be /able/ to do that.<br/>\n<br/>\nTDD does not replace communication. Don&#39;t throw out everything you have and<br/>\nreplace it with TDD make the transition in a controlled way, remove the<br/>\nthings that does not add value from what you curently do, rinse repeat in<br/>\ninfinity. (the things that do add value can maybe be made even more<br/>\nefficient too)<br/>\nYour system doesn&#39;t need to be built from the bottom either, it can be built<br/>\nfrom the top or from the middle as the details can be stubbed/mocked as you<br/>\ngo.<br/>\n<br/>\nI like Agile Software development by Robert C Martin since it touches on a<br/>\nbit of everthing. Not only tests. Another book on your list?  :)<br/>\n<br/>\n/J<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On 10/30/06, Tracey Annison &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:TAnnison@...\">TAnnison@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   Hiya, Joakim<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thanks for your reply. Hmmm... there&#39;s maybe a little<br/>\n&gt; misinterpretation there, yes... I was assuming that it was the same<br/>\n&gt; person writing the code and the tests, NOT two different people.<br/>\n&gt; But I&#39;d got the size of the cycle wrong, I think. I&#39;d guessed that<br/>\n&gt; you&#39;d write tests for everything a class does, then code the class to<br/>\n&gt; suit. But that&#39;s not what you&#39;re saying, is it...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; In your world, you write a test class that just tries to make an<br/>\n&gt; instance of the real class. But it won&#39;t compile, so you make the<br/>\n&gt; class and then the test class does compile, and the test works.<br/>\n&gt; Then you write a test that tries to run a method, but now the test<br/>\n&gt; class won&#39;t compile again because that method doesn&#39;t exist yet. So<br/>\n&gt; you write the method, and now the test compiles.<br/>\n&gt; Then you add to that test to say what you expect the method to<br/>\n&gt; return, and the test fails. So you write the code in the method and<br/>\n&gt; now the test passes.<br/>\n&gt; And so on, in teeny-tiny steps?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Well, I can now see how this can practically be used! And those rules<br/>\n&gt; do help to make it clearer. Thank you. And thanks for the FIT<br/>\n&gt; pointer, too...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; But, thinking about it, maybe this cold be a problem to work with,<br/>\n&gt; when you&#39;re trying to make a big structure with other developers?<br/>\n&gt; Because this builds up from the bottom quite slowly, if I&#39;ve<br/>\n&gt; understood it. Doesn&#39;t it take a long while before it&#39;s usable in any<br/>\n&gt; way?<br/>\n&gt; We&#39;re typically making a whole structure, with DA, DTO, Domain<br/>\n&gt; object, MVC layer and SOAP service. One of the benefits of using<br/>\n&gt; Interfaces for us, and making whole classes at a time, is that we can<br/>\n&gt; code the Interface for the DAO and Domain Object, offering everything<br/>\n&gt; we&#39;d need, and use those in the other objects, then fill in the<br/>\n&gt; detail in the actual classes. That way, we can work together on one<br/>\n&gt; entity. This would be a bit difficult to do if we built it this way,<br/>\n&gt; building up bit by bit from the bottom, wouldn&#39;t it?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Or maybe I need to think aboutthis some more...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Cheers<br/>\n&gt; Tracey<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed] </span></blockquote></div>",
