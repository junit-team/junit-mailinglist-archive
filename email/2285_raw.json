I cannot tell you how much I\nappreciate that it is called automatically before every test.\n\nIf you want to do some one time setup, I think there were some posts\nregarding that.  Do a search in the archive and you should find what you\nneed.\n\nMike Duffy wrote:\n\n&gt; When a class is added to a test suite and that test suite is run, it\n&gt; seems strange to me that the method TestCase#setUp runs every time a\n&gt; test method runs.  So if you have twenty test methods in a class and\n&gt; you add that class to a test suite, the method setUp runs twenty\n&gt; times.\n&gt;\n&gt; Shouldn&#39;t the method setUp be run just once for all the methods in a\n&gt; class?  Is there some default setting that I missed?\n&gt;\n&gt; __________________________________________________\n&gt; Do You Yahoo!?\n&gt; Make international calls for as low as $.04/minute with Yahoo!
