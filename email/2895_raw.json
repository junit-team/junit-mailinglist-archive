I got some idea from you. Thanks.\n\nBut if the classes and the methods I want to test are abstract, I \ncan&#39;t know what will happen in the methods of the subclasses which \nextend from these abstract classes. Why I asked this question is that \nthese classes I will test are a framework of our project, many of \nthem are abstract classes. Our project team must follow this \nframework and extend from these abstract classes to develop our \nproject. Now I was assigned to test if this framework is correct. \nWhat can I do?\nAny help will be appreciated greatly!\n\n--- In junit@y..., Rob Nielsen &lt;rob@v...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; If the method doesn&#39;t return anything then it probably modifies \nfields\n&gt; of the class somehow.  You can therefore test the value of this \nchanged\n&gt; object. ie:\n&gt; \n&gt; public class Foo\n&gt; {\n&gt;   int x;\n&gt; \n&gt;   public Foo(int x)\n&gt;   {\n&gt;     this.x=x;\n&gt;   }\n&gt; \n&gt;   public int getX()\n&gt;   {\n&gt;     return x;\n&gt;   }\n&gt; \n&gt;   public void incrementX()\n&gt;   { \n&gt;     x++;\n&gt;   }\n&gt; }\n&gt; \n&gt; public class FooTest extends TestCase\n&gt; {\n&gt;   public void testIncrementX()\n&gt;   {\n&gt;     Foo foo=new Foo(5);\n&gt;     foo.incrementX();\n&gt;     assertEquals(6,foo.getX());\n&gt;   }\n&gt; }\n&gt; \n&gt; chenhuitao@y... wrote:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I am a newbie to junit.But now i have a job in my hand.I need to \nuse\n&gt; &gt; JUnit to test some existed java programme.Some methods of classes\n&gt; &gt; have no return value.I can not change the source programme.How \ncan I\n&gt; &gt; test these programme by JUnit?\n&gt; &gt; Thank you for your any help!\n&gt; &gt; //BR ChenHuitao\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; &gt; junit-unsubscribe@y...\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Your use of Yahoo!
