I haven&#39;t figured out\nexactly what&#39;s going on yet but from what you&#39;ve said, I&#39;ve tracked it\ndown to the following.  \n\nThe problem appears to be with a HashMap.  It works fine when there is\nonly one key/value pair to be added but it breaks when more than one\nitem are added.  The following code fragement demonstrates the issue.\n\npublic class Household {\n\nprivate HashMap dailyActivities = new HashMap();\n\npublic void updateDailyActivities() {\n\n        float[] actProbs = new float[IdeasModel.ticksPerDay];\n        float[] act = new float[IdeasModel.ticksPerDay];\n        float f;\n        HashMap act_map = Society.getAllActivityProfiles();\n\n        Random.createUniform();\n        \n        for (Society.ActivityTypes a : act_map.keySet()) {\n            actProbs = act_map.get(a);\n            for (int i = 0; i&lt;IdeasModel.ticksPerDay; i++) {\n                f = Random.uniform.nextFloatFromTo(0f,1f);\n                if (f &lt; actProbs[i]) {\n                    act[i] = 1f;\n                } else {\n                    act[i] = 0f;\n                }\n            }\n\n            // At this point everything is fine.  The\n            // key-value pair gets added to the \n            // dailyActivities HashMap and all&#39;s good.\n            dailyActivities.put(a,act);\n\n        }\n     \n/* But step outside the `for` loop and for some reason,\n * dailyActivities gets messed up.  The keys are all there but the \n * values are all the same (should be different) and none of them are \n * correct. This doesn&#39;t happen when only act_map.ketSet() only has \n * one key.\n */\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nPerhaps some one else has had this problem with HashMaps before and\nknows how to fix it.  Thanks!\n\n\n\n\n\n",
