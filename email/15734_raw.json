I imagine that you could probably write \n&gt; something to do this yourself as quickly as extracting the interesting \n&gt; parts from my code.\n&gt; \n&gt; Can you give a few details about what you would be looking for in a \n&gt; trend analysis?  Thanks,\n&gt; \n&gt;     David Saff\n&gt; \n&gt; kp.berg wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;&gt;Hi all,\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;I know, JUnit &#39;unit&#39; tests should always pass ;-) But we are using the\n&gt;&gt;JUnit framework to write integration and systemtests as well. So from\n&gt;&gt;time to time, in this area something may go wrong. Therefore I&#39;m\n&gt;&gt;looking for a tool, that generates a report showing only the\n&gt;&gt;differences between current and last JUnit report - which failing\n&gt;&gt;tests were fixed, which tests stopped to pass, which tests were added\n&gt;&gt;and which removed. Additionaly a test trend analysis should be\n&gt;&gt;possible.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;I know, parsing the XML junitreport output and generating the info,\n&gt;&gt;e.g., with the help of a database, would be possible. But is anyone\n&gt;&gt;aware of an existing tool or open source project that can help in this\n&gt;&gt;direction?\n\n\n",
