I have downloaded a\n&gt; few smaller ones and will take on a few larger ones later (my modem\n&gt; connection is a little slow for everything  beyond 2MB or so). As soon\n&gt; as possible - but that may take some time - I&#39;ll build and test and\n&gt; cover them :-)\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks also for the general remarks on coverage - I have had some\n&gt; experience with this myself long ago, when I wrote a coverage\n&gt; precompiler - source level - for C++ about 10 years ago and forced a\n&gt; medium-sized project to go to 100% branch coverage. I also read Brian\n&gt; Marick&#39;s book and a few of his articles back then. My raw gut feeling is\n&gt; that there is more to code coverage than an arbitrary number (&quot;85%&quot;; or\n&gt; &quot;current level is 37%&quot;) and/or Marick&#39;s concept of &quot;manual hot spot\n&gt; detection&quot; (if I remember it correctly; which is important!) and/or\n&gt; impossible goals (the claim - also still mine - &quot;only 100% feasible(!? -\n&gt; how to determine?) is ok&quot;) and/or statistics showing how much/how little\n&gt; correlation there is between some sort and level of code coverage and\n&gt; functional correctness (does anyone know recent research/pracitcal\n&gt; experience of such statistics - i.e., what is [some specific] coverage\n&gt; &quot;worth&quot; on the &quot;TCO curve of quality&quot;, so-to-speak?).\n&gt; \n&gt; Working in real teams with real time-pressure and real chaos and real\n&gt; errors (also mine - I&#39;m oftentimes a lazy guy who falls for &quot;code first\n&gt; and then dont test&quot; the first moment I get under pressure ...), I&#39;m\n&gt; still (or again - after those 10 years) looking for the place where XP\n&gt; and TDD concepts on the one hand; and code coverage on the other fall in\n&gt; sync ... I also have a rough idea, but it&#39;s too early to talk about it -\n&gt; I&#39;ll first try it out on my unsuspecting team ;-)\n&gt; \n&gt; Regards\n&gt; Harald\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Yahoo!
