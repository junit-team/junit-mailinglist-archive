I would like to &quot;hijack&quot; this ecosystem for other<br/>\n&gt; languages/environments than Java. I actually did something for running<br/>\n&gt; Javascript tests with htmlunit and would now like to to do the same<br/>\n&gt; thing for C/C++ tests: use JUnit to drive and report test executions<br/>\n&gt; that encapsulates native tests.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I am no sure this is a good idea, but it kind of worked for my JS<br/>\n&gt; tests. For the C tests, I am confronted with an issue probably due to<br/>\n&gt; my misunderstanding of JUnit architecture: It seems that Runner<br/>\n&gt; instances need Class objects to work on, being passed them by the<br/>\n&gt; framework. But of course, in my particular case I do not have specific<br/>\n&gt; Class objects to work with as tests are written in native C/C++ code.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Could somebody point me to the right direction, or give me some good<br/>\n&gt; reasons to forget about this ?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Arnaud,<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are definitely ways to do what you want.  Runner doesn&#39;t require<br/>\na Java class, it just happens that almost all of the provided<br/>\nsubclasses do have a Java class.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow are you planning to run the overall test suite?  Depending on that<br/>\nanswer, it may work best to have a &quot;stand-in&quot; Java class that serves<br/>\nas the root of your C++ suite.<br/>\n<br/>\n   David Saff<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thanks<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Arnaud<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Yahoo!
