Currently datapoint methods that throw<br/>\nexceptions are simply ignored: this means that theories with two valid<br/>\nsources for a parameter quietly pass even if one of those sources is<br/>\nfailing and never producing values to test.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s an open pull request to fix this (<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://github.com/junit-team/junit/pull/639)\">https://github.com/junit-team/junit/pull/639)</a>, making those datapoint<br/>\nmethods fail instead, but there&#39;s concern that this can break tests that<br/>\ncurrently pass, or that people might even actually be depending on this<br/>\nfunctionality.<br/>\n<br/>\nDoes anybody have any strong feelings either way on this? I&#39;m particularly<br/>\ninterested from anybody who does depend on the current functionality, or<br/>\nanybody who can think of any reasonable scenarios where you might prefer<br/>\nthis behaviour.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",
