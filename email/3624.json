There may be <br/>\n&gt; interdependencies that we weren&#39;t aware of.  Most bugs seem <br/>\n&gt; obvious once they&#39;re discovered.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>int getFoo() {return foo;}<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat kind of interdependencies are there going to be?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; And besides testing get methodds are generally pretty darn easy.  In <br/>\n&gt; response to the question &quot;Why do it?&quot; I say &quot;Why not do it?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>What does the buy you?</div>",
