The<br/>\noriginal quote (paraphrased) was that &quot;we put tests in the same package as<br/>\nproduction code to make it easier to test protected interfaces of our<br/>\nobjects.&quot;  I don&#39;t see where this fits in to good design or good testing<br/>\npractices.  The virtue of public/protected/private/default is not what I was<br/>\nquestioning.  I wanted to point out the potential flaws of design and<br/>\ntesting that could otherwise be missed when you put tests in the same<br/>\npackage as production code.  The production code should be tested in the<br/>\nsame fashion it would be used by a client.  A test is a client in some<br/>\ndegree.  In most cases clients exist outside of the package.<br/>\n<br/>\nSomeone (sorry, I forget who it was) brought up the fact that &quot;client&quot; is a<br/>\nloose term that can refer to objects outside my package domain as well as to<br/>\nobjects within my package domain.  I do not disagree with that assertion.<br/>\nHowever, I believe that (in most cases) the public interface of any part of<br/>\na system should be designed in such a way that when it is tested the<br/>\nprogrammer can be assured that he/she hasn&#39;t broken anything.  The<br/>\npackage-scope clients usually have a public interface of their own which can<br/>\nthen be tested separately from the classes they interact with.  Often times<br/>\nin a situation where objects use the protected &quot;inners&quot; (either variables or<br/>\nmethods) of another object within their package there is some kind of<br/>\nheirarchical relationship where one object is a supporter of another.  Thus,<br/>\nI conclude, that testing the public interfaces of ALL objects (the key being<br/>\nALL) should prove sufficient, thus not needing the tests to reside in the<br/>\nsame package as their associated production code objects.  Of course, there<br/>\nare exceptions... we have ways around those.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Jason<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Yishay Mor [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ymor@...\">ymor@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Monday, June 11, 2001 5:57 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: RE: [junit] Best Practice for Tests ?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI could, but that would cost you more then 2c  #:-)<br/>\n<br/>\nconsider, as an example, the following pattern:<br/>\n<br/>\nabstract class A {<br/>\n        public void doSomeThingComplex() {<br/>\n                // do some stuff<br/>\n                :<br/>\n                // call extender&#39;s code<br/>\n                doSomeThingSimple();<br/>\n                // do some more stuff<br/>\n                :<br/>\n        }<br/>\n<br/>\n        protected abstract void doSomeThingSimple();<br/>\n}<br/>\n<br/>\npublic class B extends A {<br/>\n        protected void doSomeThingSimple(){<br/>\n                // do it<br/>\n        }<br/>\n}<br/>\n<br/>\n- but this is turning into a thread on Java design issues, maybe we should<br/>\ntake it elsewhere.<br/>\n<br/>\nYishay<br/>\n                        <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 04:07 PM 6/11/2001 -0400, you wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for the quote.
