To improve my development\n&gt; skills and my JUnit skills, I am writing some JUnit tests.  Today, I\n&gt; found that the developer had implemented System.exit(n) throughout\n&gt; the application whenever there was a trapped exception.\n&gt;\n&gt; Now, the requirements call for the application to return some exit\n&gt; code telling any downstream processes whether this application was\n&gt; 100% successful with no warnings (rc=0), 100% successful with\n&gt; warnings (rc=4), not successful at all (rc=8).  However, the only\n&gt; java mechanism for reporting return codes is System.exit(n), based on\n&gt; my use of Google.\n&gt;\n&gt; My JUnit dilemma then, is that System.exit(n) gives the required\n&gt; application behavior but doesn&#39;t seem to be good for running JUnit\n&gt; tests from a test suite since System.exit(n) ends the JVM.\n&gt;\n&gt; Does anyone have any insights they can share?  Since this is my first\n&gt; post to this forum, I&#39;m happy to Google some more if you&#39;ll only give\n&gt; me some keyword hint(s) beyond what I&#39;ve already tried:  &quot;java exit\n&gt; code&quot;.\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks!\n\n\nI see you get lots of suggestions on mocking etc. which I guess might be a\nbit difficult here. Cedrics suggestion seemed  like it might work, though I\nam not familiar with that. A simple  thing to try might be to start your own\nprocess for it and see what it returns. Runtime.exec() or whatever was the\nmethod to do that. Its slow and not a nice solution but might be one option\nto get something tested until you can fix it, if you can.\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n",
