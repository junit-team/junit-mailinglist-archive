Each test harness should still be able to be run individually<br/>\n&gt;&gt; as it&#39;s own test, but I&#39;m looking to the future as well, when we<br/>\n&gt;&gt; have the potential to do nightly builds and will want to run all of<br/>\n&gt;&gt; the test harnesses as a suite together. This definitely cannot<br/>\n&gt;&gt; happen if any hardcoding exists, but there needs to be some<br/>\n&gt;&gt; external way to pass each object the information specific to it<br/>\n&gt;&gt; only to test. I don&#39;t want to create a properties/configuration<br/>\n&gt;&gt; file for each object, as many of of the objects can re-use the same<br/>\n&gt;&gt; sdf file, logger, and other config files.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Mike Clark Thu Dec 30, 2004  9:49 pm<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I&#39;d be in a better position to offer advice if I saw example code.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>True.
