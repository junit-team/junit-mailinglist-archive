I understand that multiple relea=\r\nses would solve the problem of premature commitment to flexibility that lat=\r\ner becomes an uncomfortable constraint. I was asking how to make multiple r=\r\neleases when our JAR file gets incorporated with third-party products. My f=\r\nirst choice would be some kind of automatic update mechanism. If I understa=\r\nnd your suggestion correctly, you are suggesting that I just don&#39;t worry ab=\r\nout updating JUnit, as people who are interested in writing new Runners are=\r\n motivated enough to go get the new release. I will give up on the update m=\r\nechanism if necessary, but first I woulk like to know if anyone out there h=\r\nad experiences with a simple, reliable way to automatically update releases=\r\n.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nKent Beck\nThree Rivers Institute\n\n&gt; -----Original Mess=\r\nage-----\n&gt; From: junit@yahoogroups.com [mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com] On \n&gt;=\r\n Behalf Of Elliotte Harold\n&gt; Sent: Saturday, November 05, 2005 12:58 AM\n&gt; T=\r\no: junit@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Subject: Re: [junit] JUnit 4 restructuring\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\nKent Beck wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Elliotte,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Thank you for this perspective. You=\r\n are absolutely right \n&gt; that if we had frequent releases the optimal strat=\r\negy would \n&gt; be to conceal everything possible in the framework and open \n&gt;=\r\n it up &quot;on demand&quot;. I don&#39;t see how to implement frequent \n&gt; releases with =\r\nJUnit, however, since the IDE vendors bake \n&gt; JUnit into their offerings an=\r\nd we don&#39;t have any \n&gt; infrastructure to push updates. Perhaps I am just fu=\r\nssing \n&gt; about this, or there is a simple solution. I am open to suggestion=\r\ns.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Most developers will not need to extend JUnit at all, no \n&gt; ma=\r\ntter how many \n&gt; or which hooks you provide. If one does need an extra exte=\r\nnsion point \n&gt; that you decide is a good idea, then you can add it and make=\r\n \n&gt; a release. \n&gt; The developers who need it can  fairly easily install it =\r\nin \n&gt; their IDE or \n&gt; other framework.  As long as you don&#39;t actively chang=\r\ne the \n&gt; published API \n&gt; or remove any pieces of it, the IDE should contin=\r\nue to work. So I \n&gt; wouldn&#39;t worry excessively about leaving something out.=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; -- \n&gt; =EF=BB=BFElliotte Rusty Harold  elharo@...\n&gt; XML in=\r\n a Nutshell 3rd Edition Just Published!\n&gt; http://www.cafeconleche.org/books=\r\n/xian3/\n&gt; http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=3D0596007647/cafeaulaitA/\n=\r\n&gt; ref=3Dnosim\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ------------------------ Yahoo!
