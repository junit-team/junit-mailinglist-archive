    "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-987757372\">Greetings David,<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for the email! I understand where you&#39;re coming from.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I find that I end up with very few tests that actually want to say<br/>\n&gt;    assertTrue( 2 &lt; n && n &lt; 10, &quot;n should be inside the (2, 10) interval&quot;);<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Agreed.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; So, I don&#39;t usually bother with assertion failure messages.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Out of true curiosity, to what extent is this because you&#39;re already<br/>\n&gt; using the built-in assertion failure sugar in assertEquals?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Correct, I&#39;m usually employing assertEquals. I&#39;d say out of the small  <br/>\npercentage of assertions where I&#39;m *not* using assertEquals, I feel  <br/>\ncompelled to annotate less than one out of five of those. Same reason:  <br/>\nit&#39;s more effort than I feel compelled to do at the time, so I wait  <br/>\nuntil I need to add it (i.e. when a test breaks post-development).<br/>\n<br/>\nIf what you&#39;re suggesting is that most of my assertions will be as  <br/>\nsimple and readable as:<br/>\n   assertThat(x, eq(5));<br/>\nyou&#39;re right. It&#39;s the 80-20 rule, and I guess my take is that I&#39;m  <br/>\nhappy enough to write custom assert methods for my 20% rather than to  <br/>\ntry and build/use a framework that deals with every possibility. (The  <br/>\nother thought would be to punt, not using the framework when things  <br/>\ngot too ugly, but that sort of inconsistent solutions seems to make  <br/>\nthings even harder to follow.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI experimented with one of the frameworks a good while ago. Still, I&#39;d  <br/>\nbe happy to give a more recent version a try. Can you re-post a link  <br/>\nto one you recommend?<br/>\n<br/>\nMany thanks,<br/>\nJeff<br/>\n<br/>\n----<br/>\nDavid Saff said...<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for a thoughtful message.  I&#39;ll try to be fair to your<br/>\npoints--this is not something that I feel is immensely important to<br/>\nget agreement on, but I&#39;m hoping to help those who haven&#39;t tried<br/>\nassertThat to get a feeling for it&#39;s power, perhaps just enough of a<br/>\nglimpse that they&#39;ll try it, and see how it goes.  (Any apostate<br/>\nassertThat users out there?  Tried it, hated it, gone back?)<br/>\n<br/>\n...</div>",
