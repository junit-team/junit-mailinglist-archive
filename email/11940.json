We were recently purchased by a larger company that <br/>\nis considering purchasing JTest and I was wondering if people have <br/>\nhad any experiences good or bad working with JTest in a J2EE system.  <br/>\nFor this comparision price is of no concern, what concerns my boss is <br/>\nfunctionaity, tech support from Parasoft, and the tools compliance <br/>\nwith J2EE.<br/>\n<br/>\nI personally would like to stick with JUnitEE, but I need evidence of <br/>\nwhy we should.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Fazle</div>",
