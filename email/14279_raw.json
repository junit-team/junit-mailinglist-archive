Am I missing something here?\n\nAlexandru Popescu wrote:\n&gt; #: by Elliotte Harold&#39;s words the mind was *winged* :#\n&gt; \n&gt;&gt;Alexandru Popescu wrote:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;As far as I can tell I think that the new Assert class was created to remove the custom \n&gt;&gt;&gt;AssertionException and use the AssertionException provided since JDK1.4. From my point of view this \n&gt;&gt;&gt;is definitely a very good reason to have it.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;OK. I can see that, but I think that&#39;s a very bad idea. A JUnit \n&gt;&gt;assertion test failure is not at all the same thing as a Java language \n&gt;&gt;assert failure. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Not very sure they are so different in nature. According to the definition:\n&gt; \n&gt; [quote]\n&gt; An assertion is a statement in the JavaTM programming language that enables you to test your \n&gt; assumptions about your program.\n&gt; [/quote]\n&gt; \n&gt; This is exactly what your tests are doing: test assumptions about your program.\n&gt; \n&gt; They are two different things and they should be\n&gt; \n&gt;&gt;distinguishable. Failure to do that might cause unexpected problems with \n&gt;&gt;various tools that interpret an AssertionError as meaning one thing when \n&gt;&gt;JUnit makes it mean something different.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; sorry i have to disagree.\n&gt; \n&gt; :alex |.::the_mindstorm::.|\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; Yahoo!
