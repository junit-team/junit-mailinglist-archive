One of their tools minimizes the\n&gt; length of\n&gt; &gt; names where possible (it&#39;s not possible where a name is part of a\n&gt; &gt; published interface). Using this and other techniques they\n&gt; typically\n&gt; &gt; shrink Java code by well over 50% for a small one-time cost in\n&gt; terms of\n&gt; &gt; computer cycles (it takes about 4 minutes to process 3.8 MB of\n&gt; code on an\n&gt; &gt; 800 MHz PC).\n&gt;\n&gt; That&#39;s an interesting assertion.  I&#39;m not sure that I can relate it\n&gt; to the presence or absence of comments, particularly since comments\n&gt; don&#39;t end up in the compiled code.\n\nOf course.  But one of the subthreads in this discussion is that\ncomments can be made unnecessary by, for example, appropriate choice\nof variable/method/class/etc names.  This is something that we all do, I\nimagine.\n\nBut the longer and more meaningful the names, the slower the code ;-)\n\n&gt;                                   If this compression of names is\n&gt; that beneficial, then it sounds like it should be a part of the\n&gt; automated build process i.e.\n&gt;\n&gt; Source Code In ---&gt; Everything renamed to short names --&gt; Compiler --\n&gt; &gt; Result\n\nAgreed.  Googling tells me that IBM&#39;s software can be found at\nhttp://www.alphaworks.ibm.com/tech/JAX\n\n&gt; &gt; There is a reasonably reliable relationship between code size and\n&gt; &gt; speed. Less than half as many bytes typically means software that\n&gt; &gt; runs more than twice as fast.\n&gt;\n&gt; I would have expected that choice of algorithm, correct use of\n&gt; buffered I/O and so on would have a larger effect on performance\n&gt; than the relative size in bytes of the compiled result.  Is the\n&gt; article online for us to examine?\n\nIt&#39;s somewhere on www.acm.org, but I think that you have to be a\nmember to view it for free.  The article is &quot;Extracting Library-Based\nJava Applications&quot;, authors Frank Tip et al, _Communications of the\nACM_, August 2003, vol 46, no 8.\n\nThis is just one of the articles; the entire issue is focused on\nprogram compaction.\n\nHowever, we are talking partial derivatives here.  That is, given\na specific algorithm, use of buffered I/O, etc, if you have twice\nas much code to execute it&#39;s likely to take twice as long.\n\n&gt; &gt; Sure, but bear in mind the cost of using long names and an expanded\n&gt; &gt; class hierarchy to replace comments.\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;m not clear what the cost of using long variable names is.  Could\n&gt; you go into further detail about what the costs of the above two\n&gt; are?  I also suspect that if either of these things has a\n&gt; significant cost, then we are using wrong tools, or the right tools\n&gt; incorrectly.\n\nAs I recall, the constant pool is typically around 70% of the size\nof a Java .class file and the bytecode something like 14%.  A large\npart of the constant pool is just names.\n\nI haven&#39;t measured these things myself; I am relying upon perhaps\nimperfect memory of someone else&#39;s work.\n\nIf you look at the bytecode of a typical method you can see how\nexpensive referring to interfaces or in fact anything by name is.\nSee http://jakarta.apache.org/bcel and especially the bcelifier\nfor this.\n\n&gt; I must confess, I am definitely one of the &#39;comment extremely\n&gt; sparsely&#39; crowd.  What might be interesting is if we perhaps wrote a\n&gt; Ruby program to process a Java source tree, replacing the symbols\n&gt; with the smallest identifiers possible, unless they are tagged with\n&gt; a @published tag for external compatibility reasons.  I would expect\n&gt; to be able to produce a readable and maintainable program to do this\n&gt; with very few comments indeed.  I also expect to be able to write a\n&gt; program to convert a stack trace back to the original symbols, again\n&gt; with very few comments.\n&gt;\n&gt; Do you think that might be a worthwhile or interesting exercise?\n\nSure.  However, why not just write the thing in Java?\n\nI have in mind doing something like this for a large code set,\nprobably JBoss.\n\nThe object would be an Ant/Maven-compatible tool and a set of publicly\nmaintained results.  Statistics like &quot;the constant pool is X% of JBoss\nclasses&quot; and &quot;bytecode is Y% of such classes&quot; should be valuable, as\nwould be benchmarks of performance improvements from shrinking code.\n\n&gt; I can higly recommend &#39;Refactoring&#39; by Martin Fowler.  He has lots\n&gt; of great ideas and examples relating to identifying code quality,\n&gt; and a few bits on unit testing too.\n\nNoted. ;-)\n\n--\nJim Dixon  jdd@...   tel +44 117 982 0786  mobile +44 797 373 7881\n\n\n",
