One of the key\nreasons is that if you&#39;re using a full featured IDE (JBuilder, Eclipse,\n...), the IDE will offer your package methods to coders as possible\nmethods. I think this is one of the problems that people mean when they\ntalk about &#39;polluting&#39; an interface.\n\nComments are an unreliable way of preventing this. Comments get out of\ndate and ignored too often. \n\nDoesn&#39;t changing the methods from public -&gt; private after they&#39;ve passed\nthe tests means that you&#39;re no longer directly testing the methods on a\nregular basis? It does, at least, preserve test driven coding. \n\nI&#39;m mostly relying on my test suite of public methods to confirm the\nworking of private methods. And not happy about it.\n\nOn Fri, 13 Dec 2002 15:16:19 -0000 &quot;Dave Astels &lt;dave@...&gt;&quot;\n&lt;dave@...&gt; writes:\n&gt; --- In junit@yahoogroups.com, Henry Stapp &lt;hstapp@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Hi All,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The &#39;how to test private methods&#39; question\n&gt; \n&gt; Ah yes... that one.  A particularly tricky one it seems.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Leaving out the backdoor reflection approach for the moment\n&gt; \n&gt; Yes, please.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; 1) &quot;pollute&quot; the interface by making methods public that should \n&gt; be\n&gt; &gt; private.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Pollute&quot; is a stong word.  Just because a method is public doesn&#39;t \n&gt; \n&gt; mean it has to be part of the published interface.\n&gt; \n&gt; My view is that parts of a class that are part of the &quot;public \n&gt; interface&quot; and, as such, meant for general use (and that you have \n&gt; committed to supporting long term) should be defined in some other \n&gt; way that simple the visibility modifier of the method (in this \n&gt; case).  I would use JavaDoc comments (and fairly detailed ones at \n&gt; that) for things that are part of the public interface, and \n&gt; (typically) no comments for everything else.  Then creating JavaDoc \n&gt; \n&gt; gives you a document that defines the public interface.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Some argue that this is the correct thing to do, but generally \n&gt; accepted\n&gt; &gt; principles of good design seem to require making your public \n&gt; interface as\n&gt; &gt; minimal as possible.\n&gt; \n&gt; Yes.  So, to go further than the above... and on reflection a better \n&gt; \n&gt; way, define the &quot;public interface&quot; by making it a Java interface \n&gt; that \n&gt; your class implements.  Then make the interface documented and \n&gt; available.  Clients must write to the interface, implementation \n&gt; details are irrelavant to them, as they should be.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; 2) Only test the public interface, perhaps giving up detailed\n&gt; &gt; testing of internal logic.\n&gt; [...]\n&gt; &gt; Somehow to me (as an admitted TDD newbie), it just seemed better \n&gt; to \n&gt; &gt; be able to bang on these internal methods directly, rather than \n&gt; &gt;relying on the public methods to access them. \n&gt; \n&gt; f you are practicing TDD, you should not be &quot;giving up detailed \n&gt; testing of internal logic.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; With TDD you define what you need in terms of external behavior, \n&gt; write a test for it, them implement it.  Finally you clean up by \n&gt; refactoring.  So as far as your tests are concerned everything that \n&gt; \n&gt; the class has to do IS public.  When I add a new method in reponse \n&gt; to \n&gt; a test, it&#39;s public.  When I refactor and extract methods, I make \n&gt; them private.  That&#39;s the only way I make methods private.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; 3) Make more classes... change the private methods into public\n&gt; &gt; methods of new simple classes. \n&gt; \n&gt; That&#39;s a another approach, but I would only do that of the \n&gt; functionallity was needed somewhere else.  And, I&#39;d most likely also \n&gt; \n&gt; extract an interface from the new class, and have clients work \n&gt; against the interface only.\n&gt;  \n&gt; &gt; 4) Make the methods &#39;protected&#39;\n&gt; \n&gt; I only do this in response to the need of a subclass to have access \n&gt; \n&gt; to somethign that was originally private.. and I try to avoid it as \n&gt; \n&gt; much as possible.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; have your Test class inherit from your\n&gt; &gt; class under test.\n&gt; \n&gt; Gawk!  Ack!\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; I&#39;d love to hear the group&#39;s thoughts...\n&gt; \n&gt; Well, I can&#39;t speak for the group.. but these are my thoughts.  \n&gt; (Made \n&gt; them myself).\n&gt; \n&gt; Dave\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ------------------------ Yahoo!
