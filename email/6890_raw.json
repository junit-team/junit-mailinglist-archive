I had Robert Martin&#39;s recent book on my\nmind, specifically the TDD bowling game application\n(chapter 6).  Immediately afterward, as I mulled over\nwhat I&#39;d said and talked about it with others, I\nremembered how commonly objects in OOP are pretty lame\nrepresentations of anything real.  \n\nFor example, JavaBeans are nothing but simple data\nstructures with inheritance.  The ubiquitous\n&quot;services&quot; in today&#39;s many service oriented\narchitectures (e.g., JMX-based J2EE servers like JBoss\n& JRun 4) are fundamentally JavaBeans with lifecycle\nmanagement.  Other poor examples of objects modeling\nreality are Hashtable, LinkedList, and certainly\nObject!\n\n&gt; I have a feeling (entirely unsupported by any\n&gt; knowledge of the history of the field) that this\n&gt; principle might have arisen in the context of the \n&gt; analysis and design of simulations, rather than\n&gt; more general software development.  It belongs to\n&gt; simulations, imho, and is not very useful elsewhere.\n\nI&#39;m not very knowledgeable about the historical\ndetails either, but now am more interested. \nNevertheless, I think the correspondence principle is\nhelpful in data modeling, like for designing databases\n(e.g., Person, Employee, Group, and Address tables). \nIt&#39;s also helpful for UI programming with its windows,\nbuttons, menus, etc.\n\nBut on the other hand, of the least important things\nin XP and TDD is what you name the objects and methods\ninitially (you always can and should refactor the\nnames to be communicative, but initially it&#39;s not as\nimportant as getting the outputs right).  It&#39;s amazing\nhow much a very clean, tight TDD design, at the end,\ncan look so different from what one would have\ndeveloped if going with the top-down, modeling objects\napproach.\n\n[...]\n&gt; Processes do not represent any real-world object;\n&gt; they are entirely constructs of the model.  The \n&gt; question of faithfulness of representation doesn&#39;t \n&gt; arise.\n\nI am a little on the fence with this example.  You can\nexplain that a process has a start and an end, ways of\ninteracting with the environment, that they use\nresources, and are controlled, enabled or regulated by\na larger system.  In this sense, a software process\ncould correspond to a natural process, like\nphotosynthesis or blood clotting.\n\n&gt; Resources often do represent real-world objects, but\n&gt; it is highly desirable that the representations have\n&gt; properties those objects do not -- sharability among\n&gt; concurrently executing processes, for example.\n\nHow do you represent &quot;shareability&quot; as a property in\nsomething like a software file?  Is it that different\n(correspondence-wise) from making photocopies of a\nfile and letting several people read them at the same\ntime?  I don&#39;t know.  &quot;Shareability&quot; is another one of\nthese &quot;-ability&quot; words that seem difficult to explain\nbecause they are really (I think) vague terms for more\nprecise things we have yet to analyze.\n\n&gt; This illustrates a mode completely different from\n&gt; that of simulation, one in which the greatest good \n&gt; of the model is convenience for its clients (be they\n\n&gt; software or human), and faithfulness of\n&gt; representation is, if not meaningless, of\n&gt; marginal, zero, or even negative utility. In such\n&gt; modes, adding behaviour to improve testability does \n&gt; not necessarily corrupt the design.  (Refactoring \n&gt; might be better, but adding might do.)\n\n[...]\n&gt; Changeability is imho the most desirable property of\n&gt; code, and beats faithfulness of representation any \n&gt; day.\n\nI wonder if &quot;changeability&quot; could be reduced and made\nmore precise by analysis, like I am trying to reduce\n&quot;testability&quot; and &quot;maintainability.&quot;  I think most of\nthese &quot;-ability&quot; words are shorthand for more\nfundamental principles that, if made explicit, would\nhelp raise software engineering to a more sophisticated \nart form if not a science.\n\nScott Stirling\n\n\n",
