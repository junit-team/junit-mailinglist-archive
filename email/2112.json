If it is<br/>\n&gt; interesting to know how<br/>\n&gt; &gt;many test cases the system has passed, then it is also<br/>\n&gt; interesting to know how many<br/>\n&gt; &gt;asserts have made it. This is especially true if a test case is<br/>\n&gt; something like testMethod(),<br/>\n&gt; &gt;where the individual asserts verify that various values of the<br/>\n&gt; parameters to method()<br/>\n&gt; &gt;work (max, min, null, normal, etc). Sure these could all be<br/>\n&gt; individual test cases, but then<br/>\n&gt; &gt;it becomes difficult to see whether I really have exhaustively<br/>\n&gt; tested my method. Code<br/>\n&gt; &gt;coverage is not the solution. That only tells me whether what I<br/>\n&gt; have written, opposed to<br/>\n&gt; &gt;what I should have written, works.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; Vladimir Bossicard wrote:<br/>\n&gt; Ok imagine JUnit implements the counting of assertions.
