But I have tried AGlets and JavaBots.\n\n=\r\nIn both cases I tried to idolate my agent from the framework. For\nInstance,=\r\n I would run a test and logg al comunication to the agent.\nAnd I would use =\r\nthat comunication to unit test my agents.\n\nWhen I integrated the agents wit=\r\nh the enviroment, I would keep logging\n so I was able to reproduce the secu=\r\nence of messagess that produced\nthe bugs.\n\nHope that helps,\nRegards,\nSantia=\r\ngo\n\n--- In junit@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Jay&quot; &lt;jay_askren_lists@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; I=\r\n am unit testing Agents with Jade (http://jade.cselt.it/).  Starting \n&gt; and=\r\n shutting the platform and is very expensive.  It&#39;s on the order of \n&gt; a mi=\r\nnute or two to start the platform.  Before I run my unit tests, I \n&gt; want t=\r\no start the platform and when they are all done, I want to shut \n&gt; it down.=\r\n  This is easy to do if I only have one test method in my test \n&gt; case.  I =\r\ncan just put the startup code in the setup method and the \n&gt; shutdown code =\r\nin the tear down.  Unfortnately, if I have more than one \n&gt; method in the t=\r\nest case this happens before and after each method.  If \n&gt; I have 10 test m=\r\nethods, the unit test could take 20 minutes instead of \n&gt; just 3 minutes.  =\r\nIs there a way to start the platform, run all of the \n&gt; tests in the TestCa=\r\nse, and then shut down the platform?  Thanks.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Jay\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
