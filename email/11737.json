Agitar makes tools that automate<br/>\n&gt; and support developer testing. The editors of testdriven.com wish<br/>\n&gt; Kent great success in his new role.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; &quot;There is a strong movement towards increased accountability for<br/>\n&gt; software developers and software development organizations.<br/>\n&gt; Accountability is expected from every other profession in the world,<br/>\n&gt; and now software developers are being held accountable too.<br/>\n&gt; Developer Testing is a important step towards accountability. It<br/>\n&gt; gives developers a way to demonstrate the quality of the software<br/>\n&gt; they produce. Developing transparently, they become more productive<br/>\n&gt; by wasting less time reworking errors&quot;, says Kent.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Perhaps, now that the &quot;developer testing&quot; usage has been blessed (with<br/>\nproper casing, no less !-) the community can acknowledge that<br/>\ndevelopers can automate testing &quot;beyond the unit&quot; (e.g. functional<br/>\ntesting). (Perhaps, even that GUI developers _should_ use them :-)<br/>\nJust because they named it xUnit doesn&#39;t mean you can only unit test<br/>\nwith it!<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.testdriven.com/modules/news/article.php?storyid=161\">http://www.testdriven.com/modules/news/article.php?storyid=161</a><br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.testdriven.com/modules/news/article.php?storyid=163\">http://www.testdriven.com/modules/news/article.php?storyid=163</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",
