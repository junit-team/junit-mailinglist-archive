It matters when one fails.\n\nLet&#39;s say that testB uses functions that are tested in testA.\n\nDuring development, I&#39;ll be coding testA first. When that\npasses, I&#39;ll move to testB.\n\nBut tests take time. And as the number of tests grows, it\ntakes longer and longer to get to the last test on the list.\nSo testing in reverse order speeds things up during development.\n(Or simply running the last test, rather than all of them.)\n\nBut when running the full suite of tests, it&#39;s helpful to\nrun them in the original order -- because sometimes a regression\ncauses a test to fail which was passing earlier, and it&#39;s\ngood to discover such violated assumptions.\n\nSo there&#39;s a tension between wanting to speed things up\nand wanting to verify that previously valid assumptions\nstill hold.\n\nThe only way I can see to satisfy both goals is to allow\ntests to run either from first to last, or from last to\nfirst.\n\nAny other ideas?\n\n\n\n\n\n",
