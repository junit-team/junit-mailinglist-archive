What JUnit does well\n&gt; is automate the testing. It is very widely =\r\nsupported by many frameworks\n&gt; that leverage it.\n&gt;\n&gt; For example, for Sprin=\r\ng applications, there&#39;s the Spring Test Framework\n&gt; which is part of the Sp=\r\nring Framework, and also Unitils, which supports\n&gt; Spring, mocking and data=\r\nbases - see http://www.unitils.org/\n&gt;\n&gt; However, for your application, you&#39;=\r\nre looking for something that is\n&gt; tuned towards automating UI tests. Selen=\r\nium is probably the most widely\n&gt; used.\n&gt;\n&gt; We find Selenium to be very eas=\r\ny to create modular and powerful tests\n&gt; suites.
