A quick job here.  Here&#39;s the sectionon all this.\n&gt; \n&gt; Hopefully, someone gets somethign out of it :-)\n&gt; \n\n\nThanks for posting that, Dave.  What you&#39;ve written is very nice.  I \nmay even agree with most of what you&#39;ve said, based solely on my \nfaith in you as a bright person and self-described Master Software \nCraftsman.  But, I was hoping to get more of an answer to my \nquestion.  I&#39;ll be honest, based on the description you&#39;ve provided \nof this approach, I find it really hard to determine if what you&#39;re \ntalking about is either a) Genuine Refinement or b) Needless \nComplication.  Please don&#39;t take offense to this criticism.  I&#39;ll be \nthe first to admit that I&#39;m here to learn.  I think we can all say \nthe same.\n\nNow, I like to keep things simple:  I have a Java class.  It lives in \na file.  The file lives in a source code repository.  It has \ncorresponding test code that tests anything that could possibly break \nin the class.  Sometimes I check the Java class out of the repository \nand add stuff to it.  Since I practice TDD, more than likely I also \nneed to add something to the corresponding test code.  When I&#39;m done, \nI check the Java class back in, along with the corresponding test \ncode.  Cruisecontrol detects this and automatically runs a build on \nthe build server.  If the code passes all the tests, I go home and \nlife is good because I know I&#39;ll get a paycheck the next week to pay \nrent and buy food.\n\nNow, based on those very simple real world requirements, just exactly \nwhat is it that makes your approach so superior that you will \nimmediately discount all others as inadequate?\n\nI know, I know, it&#39;s in the newsletter and the forthcoming book.  \nThat&#39;s fabulous.  But you&#39;re preaching to the TDD converted here and \nwe have found our own ways, based first on the information currently \navailable and second on our own experience.  I beleive TDD has \ngathered quite a bit of momentum by now and if you have any chance of \ninfluencing its direction you need to provide a little more than just \nself-referential justification for your approach.  (Dave Astels: &quot;My \ntechnique is the best because that&#39;s what it says in my literature.  \nMy literature proposes a certain technique because it&#39;s the best \ntechnique.  My technique is the best because that&#39;s what it says in \nmy literature.  My literature proposes a certain technique because \nit&#39;s the best technique.  Blah, blah, blah.&quot;)\n\nYou say, &quot;This will help us write and organize groups of tests that \nare simpler, cleaner, more understandable, and more maintainable.&quot;\n\nThese are all noble goals for an approach to TDD.  Would you care to \nelaborate on just why you believe you have achieved these goals?\n\nMike\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
