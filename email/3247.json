I&#39;m <br/>\njust looking for a way around that requirement, since all of the <br/>\nmethods that I want to call within oneTimeSetup() and oneTimeTearDown<br/>\n() are *not* static and are existing castor framework code to build <br/>\nup and delete data for my test cases.  I just want to call this <br/>\npretty significant setup and tear down code just once and use it for <br/>\nall of my test cases verses for every testXXX() method via the <br/>\nregular setup() and tearDown() methods.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat do you mean by &quot;you can always create a singleton&quot;?<br/>\n<br/>\nthanks,<br/>\nchad.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In junit@y..., Shane Duan &lt;sduan@b...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; The reason that they are static is because they need to be called <br/>\nby <br/>\n&gt; &#39;suite()&#39; method, which is a static.  If you need to call other <br/>\nmethod <br/>\n&gt; from oneTimeSetup, my hunch is that either those method should be <br/>\nstatic <br/>\n&gt; as well.  If that is not the case, then you can always create a <br/>\nsingleton.<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>",
