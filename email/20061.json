Right now, one-shot code that I know is crap, and already scheduled to be deprecated or deleted, of course shows up at the top of the list. That makes it harder to spot the methods that really need to be looked at.<br/>\n/ Per<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a>] On Behalf Of albsavoia<br/>\nSent: Thursday, November 01, 2007 10:17 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [junit] Crap4j - Feedback and suggestions wanted<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nA few weeks ago I wrote a blog<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.artima.com/weblogs/viewpost.jsp?thread=215899\">http://www.artima.com/weblogs/viewpost.jsp?thread=215899</a>&gt; to introduce<br/>\nCrap4J a prototype open-source tool that implements the C.R.A.P.<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.artima.com/weblogs/viewpost.jsp?thread=210575\">http://www.artima.com/weblogs/viewpost.jsp?thread=210575</a>&gt; metric.<br/>\nCRAP is designed to detect a particularly nasty and dangerous Java code<br/>\nsmell:<br/>\nhigh complexity methods without adequate unit tests.<br/>\nThe concept behind CRAP is that code without tests is rarely a good<br/>\nidea; but when you couple very complex code without adequate tests you<br/>\nare really asking for it.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe did the original implementation of Crap4J as an Eclipse plug-in. The<br/>\nresponse to Crap4J was so positive that we decided to go further and<br/>\ncreated a dedicated website crap4j.org &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.crap4j.org\">http://www.crap4j.org</a>&gt; .<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;ve had hundreds of downloads since we launched the site, along with<br/>\nmany requests for Ant support and support for IDEs other than Eclipse.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe just added Ant support in 1.1.4, and we are planning to support other<br/>\nIDEs like NetBeans and IntelliJ (BTW, if you are interested in<br/>\ncontribute to plug-in development please let us know).<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you have a chance, please try Crap4J on your project and let us know<br/>\nwhat you think. We are interested in getting this group&#39;s feedback on<br/>\nCrap4j and suggestions for improving and extending it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe home page is: www.crap4j.org &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.crap4j.org\">http://www.crap4j.org</a>&gt; ; from there<br/>\nyou can navigate to the download page.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you have any problems installing it or running it, feel free to ask<br/>\nfor help on the forum or file a bug report or feature request.<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://trac.crap4j.org/\">http://trac.crap4j.org/</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\n<br/>\nAlberto<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",
