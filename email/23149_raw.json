They object to the patent provisions for reasons I cannot explain because I\n&gt; have never received an explanation that made sense to me. In these cases I offer\n&gt; to write a commercial license for JUnit with terms that meet their needs.\n&gt; Sometimes the inquirer purchases the license. Sometimes they don&#39;t.\n\nIf you don&#39;t understand why people object to the patent litigation clause,\nwell, then you&#39;re like me a few days ago, or like most of the people who\nuse JUnit - you&#39;ve been completely fooled by the implications of the\nlicense.  Start here:\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eclipse_Public_License#cite_note-patent_litigation_change-2\n\nAs I now understand it (IANAL), the CPL provides a huge disincentive to anyone\nwho depends on JUnit to enforce their patent rights with a contributor to\nJUnit *for software completely unrelated to JUnit*.  CPL (and EPL) contains\na similar patent retaliation clause limited to the licensed program (e.g.,\nJUnit), but it&#39;s this broader clause in CPL that is problematic.\n\nAs licensor, you might think this is a good thing.\n\nIf you believe software patents are evil, you might think this is a good thing.\n\nAs licensee, if you have a significant software patent portfolio, you should\nbe concerned.\n\nAsk IBM if they&#39;re willing to use someone else&#39;s software under the terms\nof the CPL license.\n\nI fully understand why you would want to offer commercial licenses for JUnit,\nand why changes that reduce your ability to make money that way would not\nbe attractive.\n\nAnd I understand that changing the license has some cost to you, for no\napparent benefit to *you*.\n\nI just think it&#39;s important for you to understand why others object to the\nlicense you&#39;ve chosen, even if you don&#39;t want to change it.  (Given the\nhistory you&#39;ve described, it&#39;s clear that you didn&#39;t choose this license\n*because* of this clause.)  I understand that you need to balance changes\nin the license that might further promote use and distribution of JUnit\nwith the cost to you of doing so and with your ability to make money by\nselling commercial licenses.\n\nDo you now understand why others have an issue with the license you&#39;re using?\n\n",
