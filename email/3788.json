I don&#39;t think the assert keyword is intended to replace runtime error checking.  In your example below, in the first case you have control over the exception thrown, and whether an exception will be thrown.  A failed assert will always cause an AssertionError.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAsserts are great for unit testing pre- and post-conditions and invariants during development.  They add something to Java that many other languages have had built-in for a long time.<br/>\n<br/>\nScott Stirling<br/>\nJRun QA<br/>\nMacromedia<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: rasmus4200 [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jr@...\">jr@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Wednesday, January 16, 2002 9:20 AM<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: [junit] Experience with jdk1.4 assert keyword<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Does anyone have any development experience with the new Java <br/>\n&gt; assertion mechanism in JDK 1.4?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I am having problems appreciating what additional value this <br/>\n&gt; mechanism brings to the Java language.  The last project I <br/>\n&gt; was on applied many of the XP practices (test first,<br/>\n&gt; unit testing).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; When designing our classes, we would write tests (contracts) <br/>\n&gt; verifiying the functionality of our classes.  If one practices<br/>\n&gt; this approach when developing, what additional benefit <br/>\n&gt; do assertions bring to the table?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; This is the example I have been using:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Say we have a Math class with a sqrt routine.  We want to make it <br/>\n&gt; clear to the outside world that our routine does not handle <br/>\n&gt; negative numbers.  If I were to write this class today using standard<br/>\n&gt; Java mechanisms for argument checking, the method would look <br/>\n&gt; something like this:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; public float sqrt(float number) {<br/>\n&gt; \tif (number &lt; 0) {<br/>\n&gt; \t   throw IllegalArgumentException(&quot;Number can not be <br/>\n&gt; negative.&quot;);<br/>\n&gt; \t}<br/>\n&gt; }<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; If we were to make this a precondition (ala Design By Contract) the <br/>\n&gt; assertion would look something like:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; public float sqrt(float number) {<br/>\n&gt; \tassert number &lt; 0 : &quot;Number can not be negative.&quot;;<br/>\n&gt; }<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Whats the difference?  Is one better then the other?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; How is the &#39;assert&#39; keyword affecting the code people are writing?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Jonathan </span></blockquote></div>",
