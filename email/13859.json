Could you do a little asking around?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I have spoken with Kent and we have talked about what would be in the<br/>\n&gt; next release of JUnit. I have 3.8.2 right now, and I don&#39;t know whether<br/>\n&gt; it&#39;s been released to the public -- the most visible change is better<br/>\n&gt; highlighting of the differences between unequal strings. :)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Expected: ab[c]def, but was: ab[dr]def<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The difference is in the brackets.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Ohhhh, nice. I could find a use for that. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Opening the kimono, Kent invited me to be involved in JUnit 3.8.x and<br/>\n&gt; JUnit 4.0, then asked me to do some code review for him, and I haven&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; done it, mostly due to low motivation. For this reason I&#39;m not too hard<br/>\n&gt; on them for keeping things under wraps: if I were really so intent on<br/>\n&gt; being involved, then I would do what they ask me to do, but since I<br/>\n&gt; didn&#39;t, I don&#39;t complain. :)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Understood. So there is some movement, albeit glacial in magnitude.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; Failing that, perhaps this group could decide what it really wanted<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and then make the changes and release a 3.8.2? I mean, it&#39;s not like<br/>\n&gt; &gt; we don&#39;t have some of the finest testing brains on the planet around<br/>\n&gt; &gt; here (self _not_ included), not to mention some very strong opinions<br/>\n&gt; &gt; (ok, I&#39;m in this category). Just a wild Friday afternoon kind of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; thought.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I strongly believe that even some of the best minds in this community<br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t share the core philosophy of maintaining a small, closed<br/>\n&gt; framework. For that reason, I&#39;m not too keen on &quot;opening it up&quot;. I don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; really trust myself with that, except for the fact that I&#39;ve never<br/>\n&gt; actually asked for an addition to JUnit. I just think more people need<br/>\n&gt; to use the JUnit-addons test runner. That would satisfy quite a few of<br/>\n&gt; them. :)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I actually agree with the substance of this. JUnit is extremely usable<br/>\nin it&#39;s current state, but I think that there are a few things that it<br/>\nwould be useful to add, such as a pass or success method and make sure<br/>\nthat the classloaders were rock-solid and that it didn&#39;t get into<br/>\nfights with ant. That&#39;s all I&#39;d ask to fix. (I know that a<br/>\npass/success method would be syntactic sugar, but I think it would be<br/>\nvery good documentary sugar, especially given the recent discussion on<br/>\nidioms for exception testing. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter those two things, I&#39;d wholeheartedly agree with encouraging<br/>\npeople to use add-ons or extensions. The only extension that I&#39;ve used<br/>\nis Mike Clark&#39;s JUnitPerf, and that was excellent.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for the information JB.<br/>\n<br/>\nSimon</div>",
