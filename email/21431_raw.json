We did indicate that\n10=\r\n0% passing unit tests were part of our development \nmethodology but that&#39;s =\r\nas far as it went. OTOH, we ran\nfull system acceptance tests manually and p=\r\nrovided reports \nof them to the FDA in reproducible form - that is all\nthe =\r\ninputs and outputs specified as the O.P. wants \nto do with a log. Reproduci=\r\nble is a watchword in this\nindustry.\n\nI&#39;ve heard of people automating these=\r\n acceptance tests\nwith FIT - in fact I know Ward did it for some clients.\nN=\r\note however that these are a different sort of \n&quot;acceptance tests&quot; from tho=\r\nse we talk about in XP. In\nfact, with one company, I had to come up with a =\r\n\ndifferent name for XP-style acceptance tests, since\n&quot;we have no authority =\r\nto accept anything.&quot; :-)\n\nIt seems to me that making unit test results avai=\r\nlable\non anything but an audit basis will lead to a lot of\nproject overhead=\r\n. In many companies, the developers\nhave little influence over the promises=\r\n made to the\nFDA as part of a certification plan, so it may turn\nout to be =\r\nnecessary to do it at this level. But if\nyou can influence it to only turn =\r\nover system,\nacceptance or integration tests, life may be easier.\n\nCharlie\n=\r\n\n&gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; From: junit@yahoogroups.com [mailto:junit@y=\r\nahoogroups.com] On \n&gt; Behalf Of David Saff\n&gt; Sent: Thursday, March 12, 2009=\r\n 7:06 AM\n&gt; To: junit@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Subject: Re: [junit] Re: A case for =\r\nadding logging of \n&gt; assertions to junit\n&gt; \n&gt; If anyone has direct experien=\r\nce on the FDA requirement in \n&gt; question, and it&#39;s direct application to un=\r\nit testing, I&#39;d \n&gt; certainly love to hear more.\n&gt; \n&gt;    David Saff\n&gt; \n&gt; On =\r\nWed, Mar 11, 2009 at 3:16 PM, Gilles Scokart \n&gt; &lt;gscokart@...&gt; wrote:=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; I was about to ask if it wouldn&#39;t it be suffisent to have a report \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; with only Pass/Failure stored with the sources of the test (without \n&gt; &gt; =\r\nwhich &quot;Smith&quot; =3D &quot;Smith&quot; in a report doesn&#39;t have any meaning).\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Bu=\r\nt actually I found one utility. =A0By tracing every \n&gt; assertion that is \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; checked, you can validate that the assertion that are written into \n&gt; &gt; =\r\nyour test are really executed, and that there is no bug in \n&gt; your unit \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; test that make the assertion skipped silently.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; If that&#39;s the reas=\r\non for such report, maybe you can suggest \n&gt; that the \n&gt; &gt; report is :\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n- Test ID Status\n&gt; &gt; - Source code\n&gt; &gt; - code coverage report of your unit =\r\ntest\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; But it is true that with regulations and laws, you can har=\r\ndly argue \n&gt; &gt; anything...\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Gilles Scokart\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; 2009/3/11=\r\n rsgmxw &lt;markwilhelm@...&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; =A0 One thing about the &quot;logging o=\r\nf assertions&quot; is reporting on the \n&gt; &gt;&gt; Actual/Observed results. I work at =\r\na company that makes Medical \n&gt; &gt;&gt; Devices. The FDA, as we&#39;re told by QA, r=\r\nequires the \n&gt; deposition of all \n&gt; &gt;&gt; tests. So even Pass&#39;ing tests must h=\r\nave their actual \n&gt; results reported \n&gt; &gt;&gt; on.

If the log is i=\r\nmportant, I have to go through \n&gt; it, or I miss \n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; something importa=\r\nnt. If it is not important (and I \n&gt; don&#39;t have to \n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; go through it)=\r\n I can skip it altogether. So what do \n&gt; you mean when \n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; you\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n say I\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; don&#39;t have to go through it?\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; I have =\r\nread carefully all the posts so far and I tend to \n&gt; agree with \n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Rob=\r\nert. I am wonder whether I miss something important too.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; I want to b=\r\ne clear, so I will take one step backward. \n&gt; What is the \n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; MAIN purp=\r\nose of JUnit? The answer is to be able to write \n&gt; AUTOMATIC \n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; unit t=\r\nest. Unit test should be written is the correct \n&gt; way, that is \n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; cor=\r\nrectly design. This has nothing to do with logging. \n&gt; Making unit \n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\ntest AUTOMATIC contradict using logging.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;you can skip the th=\r\nis paragraph&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; I want to step aside for a while. Let assume that you&#39;=\r\nre \n&gt; not using \n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; JUnit at all and write small main function to test.=\r\n I \n&gt; don&#39;t want to \n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; counter why you shouldn&#39;t do this, let focus on=\r\n what \n&gt; tools you do \n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; use in this approach. In the most cases you w=\r\nill add System.out \n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; both to the code and to the main. If you&#39;re usin=\r\ng C++, for \n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; instance, you will use preprocessor to switch on or off =\r\nthese \n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; output to the console. More advance option will be to \n&gt; use =\r\nlogging \n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; mechanism and to change it configuration depends on the \n&gt; =\r\nenvironment \n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; your program run (that is to turn on many of your log s=\r\ntatement \n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; only in development). Everything is great until your progr=\r\nam is \n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; actually fails. Again, from the experience it is almost \n&gt; al=\r\nways the \n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; case that existing System.outs are not enough, that you \n&gt;=\r\n need more \n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; information or you should add some more output early in =\r\n\n&gt; the code. \n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; So, in this point you have to option to run your progr=\r\nam \n&gt; AGAIN with \n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; debugger or to add more System.outs and to run it =\r\nas is. In both \n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; cases it can be the case that you should rerun your =\r\n\n&gt; program again \n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; (if you use debugger you could simply not pointed =\r\nout when some \n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; data changed and in the System.out case you can figur=\r\ne \n&gt; out that you need more System.outs).\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; From the paragraph =\r\nabove one should conclude that when one write \n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; unit test there is 2 =\r\ndifferent phases. First is to write \n&gt; them down \n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; in the hope that e=\r\nverything will be ok (it doesn&#39;t mean, \n&gt; that you \n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; design should be=\r\n poor or you shouldn&#39;t supply \n&gt; appropriate messages \n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; to assert sta=\r\ntements etc) and the second phase is to rerun your \n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; test if your tes=\r\nt fails. Lets see how logging will help you.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; In the first pha=\r\nse I see the only purpose using logs is \n&gt; for &#39;sanity \n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; check&#39; that =\r\nis to ensure that you actually test what \n&gt; your think is \n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; you test.=\r\n If you want to make something more than just &#39;sanity \n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; check&#39; you sh=\r\nould write unit test to your unit test, \n&gt; that is pretty silly.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Mor=\r\neover, you need to make such &#39;sanity check&#39; only when you \n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; actually =\r\nwrite this test. For this purpose logging is \n&gt; appropriate approach, IMHO.=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; In the second phase, when you rerun your unit test when \n&gt; i=\r\nt fails, \n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; you should consider to add more assert statement and \n&gt; mo=\r\nre clearly \n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; diagnostic messages first. When you done and you don&#39;t \n=\r\n&gt; see how to \n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; improve the design (recall I consider that design is \n=\r\n&gt; correct) you \n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; can add log statement manually. But in this case the=\r\ny \n&gt; will not be \n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; part of new mechanism, because no more asserts wil=\r\nl be added. So \n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; this new feature will not be in use!\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; U=\r\nsing logging in the assert statement ONLY for &#39;sanity check&#39; is \n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; ove=\r\nrkill, I think. As for me I make such &#39;sanity check&#39; in the \n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; followi=\r\nng way. First of all, I use log4j MANUALLY that is as \n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; addition to J=\r\nUnit asserts. They don&#39;t duplicate what \n&gt; asserts does \n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; they supply=\r\n additional information, such as what assertion was \n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; already done. I=\r\nn this case when assertion will fail afterwards I \n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; can look on the l=\r\nog to see in what part of unit test it happened \n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; and what tests pass=\r\ned. I go even further and use JDK 1.4 assert \n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; statement to document =\r\nprecondition, postcondition and invariants \n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; both in the code and in =\r\nthe unit test.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; The bottom line is that I see the sense using =\r\nlogs as a \n&gt; COMPLETION \n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; to the JUnit and only for &#39;sanity check&#39;. T=\r\nhis use is not \n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; duplicates JUnit assert statements and could be writ=\r\nten manually.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; [Non-text portions of this =\r\nmessage have been removed]\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; --------------------------------=\r\n----\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Yahoo!
