This way clients can still override \n&gt; y() and z(), and call them from the subclass, but they can \n&gt; not be invoked from outside the class.\n&gt; \n&gt; Keeping this on topic, the protected methods shouldn&#39;t be \n&gt; very difficult to test.  The test can create a MockMyClass \n&gt; that overrides y() and z() but change the modifier from \n&gt; protected to public.\n\nYes, making the methods protected instead of public would work for\nsubclassing. I didn&#39;t mention that because in order to write tests that\nlive in a different package you&#39;d have to wrap the methods as you\nshowed, which adds additional, and what I would consider unnecessary,\ninfrastructure.\n\nI guess for me the test for the utility of access protection is that in\nall the years and thousands of lines of Smalltalk code I&#39;ve written I&#39;ve\nwished for a number of things to be added to the language, but member\naccess protection was never one of them and it certainly doesn&#39;t make\ntesting any easier.\n\n---\nOutgoing mail is certified Virus Free.\nChecked by AVG anti-virus system (http://www.grisoft.com).\nVersion: 6.0.528 / Virus Database: 324 - Release Date: 10/16/2003\n \n\n\n",
