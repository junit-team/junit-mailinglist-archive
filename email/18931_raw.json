Granted t=\r\nhese books were published in 2004 and 2005\n&gt; respectively, so may be a bit =\r\noutdated.\n&gt; \n&gt; JUnit in Action uses DynaMock for its database testing examp=\r\nles in\n&gt; Chapter 11. Does DynaMock still exist or is JMock the new version =\r\nof\n&gt; it? But JMock doesn&#39;t contain any specific SQL classes, like\n&gt; MockCon=\r\nnection, or?\n&gt; \n&gt; EasyMock doesn&#39;t seem to have any SQL specific classes ei=\r\nther.\n&gt; \n&gt; So what&#39;s the latest recommendation of a mock object implementat=\r\nion\n&gt; when testing database applications?\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt; Deirdre\n&gt;\n\n\n\n",
