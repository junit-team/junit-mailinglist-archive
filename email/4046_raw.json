Then use \n  assertTrue(&quot;...&quot;,myFunction(obj,xml)) \nin your tests.  \nThis way your custom test code is still enclosed in the test class (or\nat least in the same package) and you don&#39;t have to override anything in\nthe testing framework.\n\nIf you were comparing two objects of the same class, I would recomend\njust putting the comparison code in the .equals() method, but it sounds\nlike you are comparing an object to an XML fragment.\n\nOn Tue, 2002-02-12 at 20:31, pisharath_k wrote:\n    I have a basic question. I have a set of classes whose values are set \n    from a file by a Reader object. Now I want to test whether these \n    values are set correctly. I can use preset values for testing \n    purpose. But due to the large number and complexity of these classes \n    it would be very difficult and cumbersome to create objects with \n    these preset values manually for testing against the ones created by \n    the Reader.\n    \n    I am thinking of creating a helper class for each of the above \n    classes. I will pass it the object to compare, and it will compare \n    the object&#39;s data against pre-defined values that will be stored in \n    the helper classes. I will need to extend junit&#39;s Assert class for \n    these helper class, since they will assert if there is a data \n    mismatch. So my question is,  is it okay to extend Assert in my own \n    classes ? Has anyone faced this problem before, and if so how did you \n    solve this ? Any help will be appreciated.\n    \n    Thanks,\n    - krishnan\n    \n    \n    \n    To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n    junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n     \n    \n    Your use of Yahoo!
