I am not proposing an answer <br/>\n&gt; myself but as a learning experience I would like to see an <br/>\n&gt; example of where you used something like a mock or in-memory <br/>\n&gt; database and then got caught out with the &quot;real thing&quot;.  <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Even without any specific example, it&#39;s not hard to see the risk in testing<br/>\ncode that is different from what your production machines are running.  The<br/>\ncost of a false positive (tests run but production breaks) is two-fold:<br/>\n<br/>\n- You need to fix the bug (might be unavoidable)<br/>\n- You have to pay the price of pushing a defective product in production<br/>\n(very high, and unacceptable in my book)<br/>\n<br/>\nDon&#39;t get me wrong, I&#39;m not opposed to the idea of mock objects, but it<br/>\nseems to me that if you want to do more than unit testing with JUnit (which<br/>\nis a mistake in my opinion), you are *forced* to use mock objects.  It&#39;s<br/>\njust the only way to solve this problem.<br/>\n<br/>\nMock objects are a fine solution if you have other alternatives and after<br/>\nyou considered them all, mock objects came out as the best solution, but<br/>\nthey come at a price (well, two prices:  the one I just mentioned and the<br/>\nfact that you need to maintain two parallel hierarchies).<br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I am thinking that if this happened to me it would show me <br/>\n&gt; where I should write another test perhaps?  <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Maybe.  Or you would use the exact same test on the real (non-mocked) code<br/>\nand the bug would show up right away.  I know which one I prefer...<br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; For example what are things that have gone wrong testing <br/>\n&gt; against Postgresql and then using against Oracle?  <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Plenty of things can go wrong since the chain is made of so many links:<br/>\n<br/>\n1) Bug in the database itself (more likely in Postgresql than Oracle IMO)<br/>\n2) Bug in your code<br/>\n3) Bug in the JDBC driver (there are many to choose from in boths cases)<br/>\n4) Bug in how you set up your environment<br/>\n5) Bug in the mock<br/>\n<br/>\nBy not using a mock, at least you eliminate risk 5).<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nCédric<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://beust.com/weblog\">http://beust.com/weblog</a></div>",
