But alas, I<br/>\nbelieve we are off-topic now.  You are correct in the sense that it<br/>\nreduces memory usage, but as a habit (personally) I feel it should be<br/>\navoided.  If I must optimize, this is surely a good optimization place. <br/>\nFor example:<br/>\n<br/>\n  BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(file));<br/>\n  String line = null;<br/>\n  while ( (line = reader.readLine()) != null ) {<br/>\n    doSomethingWith(line);<br/>\n  }<br/>\n<br/>\nis _MUCH_ cheaper (in terms of allocation) than:<br/>\n<br/>\n  BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(file));<br/>\n  while ( reader.ready() ) {<br/>\n    String line = reader.readLine();    <br/>\n    doSomethingWith(line);<br/>\n  }<br/>\n<br/>\n=jason<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Mon, 2004-04-05 at 15:44, Kathy Van Stone wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Strings are immutable, so I don&#39;t see that this can happen.

You<br/>\n&gt; &gt;then set your variable newLoginId to equal that, which is to say that<br/>\n&gt; &gt;there is some slot in memory (let&#39;s call it B) that now points to A.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Then you set your dupLoginId variable that lives at slot C in memory and<br/>\n&gt; &gt;tell it to point to slot B, which is pointing to slot A which is &quot;ABC&quot;.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Yes, strings are immutable, but that means nothing in this case.  You<br/>\n&gt; &gt;have 2 references to the same object in memory.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Yes, but if that object is guaranteed never to change (which is true of <br/>\n&gt; Strings), what is the harm? This is the type of aliasing that is considered <br/>\n&gt; beneficial, as it reduces memory usage.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Actually by the above model I believe that the dupLoginId points to A not B <br/>\n&gt; as &quot;value&quot; of a reference is the memory it points to and = copies <br/>\n&gt; values.  To check, run the following code:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; String a = &quot;abc&quot;;<br/>\n&gt; String b = a;<br/>\n&gt; a = &quot;cde&quot;;<br/>\n&gt; System.out.println(b);<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; It will print &quot;abc&quot;.  (At least it did when I tried it out in bsh).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; (Also see Item 4 of Effective Java).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -Kathy Van Stone<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kvs@...\">kvs@...</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; Yahoo!
