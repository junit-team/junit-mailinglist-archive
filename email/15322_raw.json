Plus, you normally don&#39;t write more\nthan one=\r\n @BeforeTest method per class. I also think(hope) that most\nprogrammers cho=\r\nose the modules they use depending on what those\nmodules do, not on how lon=\r\ng their names are... The shorter names may\nalso be the cause of misundersta=\r\nndings (since they are less clear)\nwhich can result in code being put into =\r\nplaces where it doesn&#39;t belong. \n\n\n\n\n\n",
