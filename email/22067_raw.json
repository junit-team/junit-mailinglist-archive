I understan=\r\nd that had I done this programmatically, I could have attached a RunListene=\r\nr, implementing the testRunFinished(Result) method.\n\nIs there any way to ac=\r\nhieve a similar effect within the JUnit runner in Eclipse?\n\nRationale: I ha=\r\nve actual unit tests, then bigger tests, then full-fledged &quot;integration tes=\r\nts&quot; or whatever one call them, where I take up my entire application-local =\r\nserver thingy and process a bunch of items, letting JUnit check after the d=\r\nust settles whether the items was processed correctly. However, the interna=\r\nls are multi threaded, and also, this being a Swing app, lots of Runnables =\r\nare sent over to the EDT. This is all good.\n\nHowever, I&#39;ve sometimes seen t=\r\nhat a thread crashes (uncaught exception), without this being noticed by an=\r\ny of the tests running (I&#39;ve e.g. seen a ConcurrentModificationException ta=\r\nke down the EDT, without having a clue as to why I got that - and the next =\r\nevent posted just brings up a new EDT, so I get a green bar, but with an un=\r\ncaught error). What I&#39;d want to achieve, is to install an uncaught exceptio=\r\nn handler, and then, as a final step to ALL permutations of tests (e.g. bot=\r\nh for a single unit test, and also for the project-wide test run), run a te=\r\nst that checks whether any thread-killing exception was caught by the handl=\r\ner, and if so, fails the run. (I&#39;d throw the exception that was caught, and=\r\n in any case also log-dump any and all such exceptions).\n\n(As a very simila=\r\nr question, I&#39;d also like to have a &quot;before any tests&quot; thing, like the RunL=\r\nistener.testRunStarted(Description) method, where I could set up logging. N=\r\now I do that by letting ALL tests have a static block that calls a specific=\r\n static method which has a static boolean that tells whether the log system=\r\n already is set up. This also works just nicely, but is a hassle neverthele=\r\nss. However, it is not possible, as I see it, to solve the above question i=\r\nn the same manner.)\n\n\n",
