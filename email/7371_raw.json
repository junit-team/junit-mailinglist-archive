If  \n&gt; anyone has a way to do that, please reply.\n\nI think the way to do this within the JUnit framework is to use the \nTestSuite to group tests.  Looks something like this:\n\npublic class DBTestCase extends TestCase {\n    String connectString\n    DB_Connection connection;\n    \n    DBTestCase(String name, String connectIn) {\n        super(name);\n        connectString = connectIn;\n    }\n    protected void setUp() {\n        // open connection\n    }\n    protected void tearDown() {\n        // close connection\n    }\n    protected void runTest(){\n        // grab all public methods starting with &quot;test&quot;\n        TestSuite allDBTests = new TestSuite(getClass());\n        allDBTests.run();\n    }         \n}\n\nThen you add a bunch of testXXXX() methods.  Better yet, you could \nextend DBTestCase, and just write all the testXXXX methods in the \nsubclass--that way you can have different sets of db tests, and \nreuse the DBTestCase. \n\n\n&gt; Another difference is really one of design taste I suspect. I \njust  \n&gt; found it non-intuitive that JUnit gave each test method invocation \nits  \n&gt; own instance, especially when they also provided the setUp() \nmethod.  \n\nWhen you say JUnit gives each test method invocation it&#39;s own \ninstance, I&#39;m assuming you are refering to the default way \nTestCase.runTest() works (trying to run a method with the same name \nas the test case).  I hardly ever use the default runTest()--my \nguess is that it is only left in there for backward-compatibility.\n\nI find the type of runTest() I showed above much more useful.\nWould this solution address the problems you were concerned with?\n\n\n\n\n\n",
