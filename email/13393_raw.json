We will probably want to have more than one test for\n&gt;&gt; each, which will likely lead to a &quot;combinatorical explosion&quot;\n&gt;&gt; if we test all the four steps together.\n&gt; \n&gt; The combinatorial explosion appears if you don&#39;t maintain\n&gt; state.  With this approach, your tests are going to look like:\n&gt; \n&gt; Test1:\n&gt; \t1\n&gt; Test2:\n&gt; \t1-2\n&gt; Test3:\n&gt; \t1-2-3\n&gt; Test4:\n&gt; \t1-2-3-4\n&gt; \n&gt; This is a huge waste of time.\n\nI agree that the above would be a waste of time. It seems to me as if you\ndidn&#39;t consider the decoupling I referred to above, though.\n\nThe approach I&#39;d prefer would more look like\n\nTest1:\n\t1\nTest2:\n\t1m-2\nTest3:\n\t2m-3\nTest4:\n\t3m-4\n\nwhere the Xm steps are mock steps which are presumly (with a well testable\ndesign) easier to set up than the real (production) ones.\n\nCheers, Ilja\n\n\n",
