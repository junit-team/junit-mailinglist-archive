I also have lots of test data, input files/ extected\nresults.  Also, developers keep adding to this list of files.\n I would like to write a testCase which would get all files from a\nfolder, and checked if the results are fine. (in a for/while loop).\nFor this, i will have a single test-case method. However, the problem\nis i would like the test&#39;s to \n 1) Run for all test-case and not stop if one fails.\n 2) Have more info in the TestResult. Not just details of the one\nmethod. Ideally, within the test case, i would like to add details\ninto the TEstResult indicating for which files the tests failed.\n How do i do this using junit ?\n\nThanks, \n ~preetham\n \n\n\n\n",
