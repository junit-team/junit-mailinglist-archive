Since JUnit 4 is not so new =\r\nanymore I thought that such a documentation already exists. If it is releas=\r\ned that year (a few class diagrams and a few sequence diagrams) than it wou=\r\nld be very good and make a lot of people happy I think.\n\nMainly since Kent&#39;=\r\ns XP and agile philosophy (nothing against that), which states that redesig=\r\nn and refactoring is preferred to documentation, I thought it would not be =\r\ndone.\n\nBye,\n\nHans\n\n--- On Sun, 10/26/08, David Saff &lt;david@...&gt; wrote:=\r\n\nFrom: David Saff &lt;david@...&gt;\nSubject: Re: [junit] Design documentatio=\r\nn for JUnit 4.x?\nTo: junit@yahoogroups.com\nDate: Sunday, October 26, 2008, =\r\n9:10 PM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n            Hans,\n\n\n\nI&#39;m truly sorry to have spoken =\r\nunclearly and accidentally send you on\n\na wild goose chase.

It is not the kind of documentation I meant.\n\n&gt;\n\n&gt; Such =\r\ntools just twist and twirl data and present it in a way which does not\n\n&gt; h=\r\nelp much to understand the design.\n\n&gt;\n\n&gt; A good documentation cannot be aut=\r\nomated away or roundtripped.\n\n&gt;\n\n&gt; You need some text and some diagrams. Bo=\r\nth need not be perfect. But as I\n\n&gt; said, that can&#39;t be automated, or at le=\r\nast is not valuable for understanding\n\n&gt; it quickly as it would be from a h=\r\numan who knows how man thinks and how the\n\n&gt; design is and what does matter=\r\n to know and what is unnecessary detail.\n\n&gt;\n\n&gt; But it seems no matter what =\r\nI would write, you mean that there will be no\n\n&gt; such manual documentation.=\r\n A little design documentation would be very good\n\n&gt; for understanding such=\r\n a widely used tool. Thousands of programmers should\n\n&gt; not need to downloa=\r\nd a specific tool and then discover that it does not help\n\n&gt; them understan=\r\nding JUnit&#39;s design.\n\n&gt;\n\n&gt; Just my opinion.\n\n&gt;\n\n&gt; --- On Thu, 10/23/08, Dav=\r\nid Saff &lt;david@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt; From: David Saff &lt;david@...&gt;\n\n&gt; Sub=\r\nject: Re: [junit] Design documentation for JUnit 4.x?\n\n&gt; To: junit@yahoogro=\r\nups. com\n\n&gt; Date: Thursday, October 23, 2008, 1:45 PM\n\n&gt;\n\n&gt; None published.=\r\n\n\n&gt;\n\n&gt; If someone wanted to download a trial copy of Structure 101 and\n\n&gt;\n\n=\r\n&gt; produce some, that&#39;d be cool, and I&#39;d be happy to answer questions.\n\n&gt;\n\n&gt;=\r\n David Saff\n\n&gt;\n\n&gt; On Thu, Oct 23, 2008 at 4:36 AM, Hans Schwaebli\n\n&gt;\n\n&gt; &lt;ha=\r\nns_schwaebli@ yahoo.com&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt;\n\n&gt;&gt; Is there any design documentation fo=\r\nr JUnit 4.x?\n\n&gt;\n\n&gt;&gt;\n\n&gt;\n\n&gt;&gt; I mean class diagrams and sequence diagrams?\n\n&gt;\n=\r\n\n&gt;&gt;\n\n&gt;\n\n&gt;&gt; __\n\n&gt;\n\n&gt;&gt;\n\n&gt;\n\n&gt;&gt;\n\n&gt;\n\n&gt;&gt;\n\n&gt;\n\n&gt;&gt;\n\n&gt;\n\n&gt;&gt;\n\n&gt;\n\n&gt;&gt;\n\n&gt;\n\n&gt;&gt;\n\n&gt;\n\n&gt;&gt;\n\n&gt;\n\n&gt;=\r\n&gt;\n\n&gt;\n\n&gt;&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n&gt;\n\n&gt;&gt;\n\n&gt;\n\n&gt;=\r\n&gt;\n\n&gt;\n\n&gt;\n\n&gt;\n\n&gt;\n\n&gt;\n\n&gt;\n\n&gt;\n\n&gt;\n\n&gt;\n\n&gt;\n\n&gt;\n\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message ha=\r\nve been removed]\n\n&gt;\n\n&gt; \n\n\n      \n\n    \n    \n\t\n\t \n\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\n    =\r\n  \n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n",
