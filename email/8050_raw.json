We do 3\n&quot;tests&quot; in one method Write test data, Retrieve that data, delete that\ndata.  That&#39;s 3 separate methods of the class that we are testing,\nhowever, we do all three things in a single test method.\n \nRobert Brown \nSinex Aviation Technologies\n \n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: Bryce Fischer [mailto:bryce@...] \nSent: Wednesday, May 14, 2003 12:41 PM\nTo: junit@yahoogroups.com\nSubject: [junit] Test Dependencies\n \nI&#39;ve got a fairly basic class (actually, its just a container for other\nclasses). This class needs to be serialized to a file and then reloaded\nat\nsome point.\n\n\n\nI&#39;m using this as an opportunity to learn more about JUnit (since its\nfairly\nsimple). My question is this\n\n\n\nGiven that I have two methods of my class I need to test, SaveLicense\nand\nLoadLicense, should I write this as two separate tests or as a single\ntest\nthat incorporates both? To clarify, to load a license, I would need to\nhave\na saved license. The load license would then verify that the information\nthat was saved was loaded correctly.\n\n\n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYahoo!
