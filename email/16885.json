A while back, as the project grew,<br/>\n&gt; there were times when we would break tests (or because we had<br/>\n&gt; external dependencies that we had to wait and had not yet mocked<br/>\n&gt; things out), tests would fail for a few days before we could get to<br/>\n&gt; them.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; This stopped our CI, so we introduced a helper class, TimeBomb. We&#39;d<br/>\n&gt; add a call to TimeBomb with a date and the test would stop failing<br/>\n&gt; until after the provided date.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; It was an active way to remind us go back and fix something in a few<br/>\n&gt; days.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; @Ignore has a message. What about adding a date? Ignore until the<br/>\n&gt; date, after which the test will fail by throwing a runtime exception?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Is that crazy?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Brett<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed] </span></blockquote></div>",
