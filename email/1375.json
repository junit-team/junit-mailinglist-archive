However I think I would be reluctant to change the way my<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;&gt; code was implemented just so that I could test it, as some of the other<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; My experience is different. I&#39;ve found that changing my coding style to make it testable (which doesn&#39;t mean just putting in lots of unnecessary accessors) also makes it better. The more I apply this to different targets, such as shell scripts, the more I&#39;m convinced. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Steve<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I concur.  I&#39;ve found that testable code exhibits certain composable <br/>\nproperties that foster interface-based design.  For example, the <br/>\nassembly of a few simple objects to perform a more complex task allows <br/>\nany of the objects to be mocked.  In turn, by refactoring designs to <br/>\nextract complex static relationships into interface-based compositions, <br/>\nthe design becomes more open to extension, but closed to modification. <br/>\nSo, I&#39;ll up the ante and claim that designs may change as a side effect <br/>\nof writing tests.  This is the essence of test-first design.<br/>\n<br/>\nMike<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nMike Clark<br/>\nClarkware Consulting, Inc.<br/>\nCustom Software Architecture, Design,<br/>\nDevelopment, and Performance Consulting<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.clarkware.com\">http://www.clarkware.com</a></div>",
