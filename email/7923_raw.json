A &quot;coverage measure&quot; is a measure -- it does not=\r\n cover anything.\n\nThere are different kinds of test coverage, measured by t=\r\nhe aspects of the program they cover. 100% line coverage seems to be the mo=\r\nst definite of the ones you list, although it does not take into account di=\r\nfferent data sets. It is possible to have 100% line coverage and still have=\r\n a defect because you have not written code to handle a particular case.\n\nI=\r\n do not like test coverage measurement. It is not smart enough. Obviously, =\r\n90% coverage is much better than 50% coverage, but the return on investment=\r\n goes down considerably up over 90%. My opinion.\n\nTake care.\n\n&gt;So said java=\r\ninsel on 2003-05-04 --------------------\n&gt;I read about Line Coverage, Branc=\r\nh Coverage, Condition Coverage, \n&gt;Path Coverage, Call Coverage, Loop Covera=\r\nge, Linear Code Sequence \n&gt;and Jump (LCAJ) Coverage and Data Flow Coverage.=\r\n And also I read \n&gt;something about Data Chains (same as Data Flow?).\n&gt;\n&gt;Is =\r\nthere a coverage measure which covers 100%?\n&gt;\n&gt;And is there a ranking of co=\r\nverage measures in terms of how much \n&gt;they cover compared to the other mea=\r\nsures?\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Yahoo!
