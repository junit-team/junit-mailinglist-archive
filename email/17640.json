That <br/>\nwas left to multi-tasking or other platform specific implementation details.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd on systems with separate JVMs on separate CPUs, some problems<br/>\ndon&#39;t show up on multi-CPU systems that are real on single-JVM systems <br/>\nwith heavy multi-threading.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt may be that JUnit is focused on single unit tests that are executed <br/>\nsequentially.
