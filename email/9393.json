Regression test prioritization is a <br/>\nmethod of organizing test cases such that those tests deemed to be <br/>\nmore effective by a test adequacy criterion are placed at the <br/>\nbeginning of a regression test suite.  The tool that I plan to build <br/>\nwill be implemented as an extension to JUnit.  As part of my <br/>\nanalysis, I shall run my prioritization tool on a set of test cases <br/>\nfor a real world Java application to see if the rate of fault <br/>\ndetection increases.  If anyone has a Java application with a <br/>\nsubstantial set of JUnit test cases or would like to suggest a site <br/>\nwith an application and test cases that I can download, I would <br/>\nappreciate the contribution.<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you for your consideration in this matter.</div>",
