My question was sparked<br/>\nbecause I was in what I would call a laborous position - multiple code paths<br/>\nso multiple test cases. I had 30 test cases for one method, amounting to 300<br/>\nlines of code. Is this tedious or difficult. In JUnit world, does tedious ==<br/>\ndifficult?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\nKevin.<br/>\n<br/>\n -----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: J. B.

As to whether you can conveniently refactor,<br/>\nthat is another issue.<br/>\n<br/>\nTry garden-variety Extract Method. If a method has too many codepaths,<br/>\nextract the smallest, innermost part you could reasonably test on its<br/>\nown, make it public, then test it in isolation.
