I don&#39;t see how that&#39;s <br/>\npossible, since &quot;this&quot; cannot be null. I read on. I found out that the <br/>\nbug is that some other code in this class assumes that this.type is not <br/>\nnull, and because someone was permitted to invoke _setType(null), there <br/>\nis a problem.<br/>\n<br/>\nI disagree.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe bug is in whatever code invoked _setType(null). Possibly, the real <br/>\nbug is in providing a way to change this property after object creation <br/>\nin the first place.<br/>\n<br/>\nI strongly doubt the programming error was not testing the setter; it <br/>\nwas not testing the code that tried to use it.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf we /do/ want to make the property writable and publish that API for <br/>\nanyone to use, then it might be worth programming more defensively, but <br/>\nin this case, the property isn&#39;t even directly writable, which makes me <br/>\nbelieve even more strongly that the bug is not in the setter. After <br/>\nreading your article more closely, the bug was in the non-trivial public <br/>\nsetType() method and not in the private and trivial _setType() method. A <br/>\nmethod like setType() that does data checks is certainly not Too Simple <br/>\nto Break and I would definitely test it.<br/>\n<br/>\nBased on that, I feel your argument is of the bait-and-switch kind: you <br/>\noffer up the _setType() example as code that should be tested, but <br/>\njustify it by concluding that setType() is the method really ought to be <br/>\ntested. This might be harsh, but that reasoning just doesn&#39;t work.<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course, this is just one man&#39;s opinion, and I&#39;m writing this more for <br/>\nthe audience than in any hope of changing your mind. I&#39;m OK with the <br/>\nfact that we have different thresholds for &quot;Too Simple to Break&quot;. I&#39;m <br/>\nnot OK with faulty reasoning.<br/>\n<br/>\nTake care.<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJ. B.
