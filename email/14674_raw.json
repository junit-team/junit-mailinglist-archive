However, we also \nfound that, in general, it helped us more in finding dead code than in \nidentifying new opportunities to test.\n\n    David Saff\n\nKent Beck wrote:\n\n&gt; Thomas,\n&gt;\n&gt; I don&#39;t think this coverage is off-topic at all, since the coverage \n&gt; testers\n&gt; I&#39;ve tried all use JUnit tests to initiate execution of the code.\n&gt;\n&gt; As it happens, Erich and I measured the coverage of our tests in JUnit 4\n&gt; today. We used Coverlipse first. I liked the user interface (you initiate\n&gt; coverage measurement with a new kind of launch configuration), but the\n&gt; results weren&#39;t accurate. We set breakpoints on lines that the tool \n&gt; claimed\n&gt; weren&#39;t covered and execution stopped there. We also tried Clover, \n&gt; which has\n&gt; a slightly less natural interface (you set an &quot;enable Clover&quot; flag on the\n&gt; project properties). The results, however, seemed much more accurate.\n&gt;\n&gt; The result of our testing was that we found two methods out of JUnit 4 \n&gt; that\n&gt; we felt needed tests. Our overall coverage is 68%, and it seems like it\n&gt; would be easy to get it up to 80%. However, the only functional code that\n&gt; really needed more tests were those two methods.\n&gt;\n&gt; Sincerely yours,\n&gt;\n&gt; Kent Beck\n&gt; Three Rivers Institute\n\n\n\n",
