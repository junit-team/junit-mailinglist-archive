Who said that? ;-)\n\n&gt; A much simpler approach is to create a test case extension\n&gt; which\n&gt; delegates it&#39;s execution to a session bean.\n\nWhy is it simpler? That&#39;s exactly Cactus&#39;s approach! :-). ATM cactus\nonly provides Filter, Servlet and Jsp extensions but we are working on\nproviding EJB redirectors (session beans, MDB, EB). I would love to be\nable to work with you on that if you&#39;re interested! It seems we could\neasily integrate your solution in Cactus :-)\n\nBTW, most person call their EJB from a Web layer and thus it makes sense\nfor them to use the ServletTestCase to write their unit test as the test\nis then more similar to production. But I agree that&#39;s not the only use\ncase which is why I am very keen to have the EJB redirectors implemented\nin Cactus!\n\n&gt; \n&gt; There is a package which provides this at\n&gt; http://www.junit.org/junit/download/ServerTestCase.zip\n\ncool. Maybe we can join forces.\n\n&gt; \n&gt; To use it, just deploy the session bean and extends ServerTestCase\ninstead\n&gt; of TestCase for tests you want to run inside the server.\n\nCool. Again, that&#39;s exactly in the same way as Cactus does it.\n\n&gt; \n&gt; The tests will behave like the client/standalone tests, so there will\nonly\n&gt; be one test suite to manage and there&#39;s no need to re-create all the\n&gt; features mentioned below specially for the server-side tests.\n&gt; \n\nYes, but I don&#39;t see how you test your web layer with your solution. If\nI remember correctly that was what I was answering to :-). In any case\nyou don&#39;t need to care as Cactus is hiding this for you. EJBs are\nwell-defined components and as such are much easier to unit test than\nweb components. Actually if you have remote EJBs, you don&#39;t even need to\nhave a session bean redirector, which is even simpler ... :-)\n\n&gt; ...Yeah, I know I&#39;m lagging somewhat  :-)\n\nI don&#39;t think so :-)\n\n-Vincent\n&gt; \n&gt; --\n&gt; Jon S Bratseth\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; &gt; From: Vincent Massol [mailto:vmassol@...]\n&gt; &gt; Sent: 13. juli 2002 12:49\n&gt; &gt; To: junit@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; &gt; Cc: mrettig@...\n&gt; &gt; Subject: RE: [junit] Testing a class inside an Application Server\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Hi Michael,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;biased&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; How different is what you have described from\n&gt; &gt; http://jakarta.apache.org/cactus/1.4/howto_tomcat.html ?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Actually, what you described is exactly JUnitEE\n&gt; &gt; (http://junitee.sourceforge.net/).\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I agree with you, it starts simple and then you need some more\nfeatures.\n&gt; &gt; For example, you need to automate the tests as part of a build (this\nis\n&gt; &gt; probably one of the most wanted feature). So you will start to have\na\n&gt; &gt; client part that calls your URL, parses the XML and display the\nresult.\n&gt; &gt; All is fine but then you also want to be able to execute the test\nfrom\n&gt; &gt; any of the existing JUnit integration tools (from IDEs, using Ant\njunit\n&gt; &gt; task, etc). So you will transform your client side into a TestCase\nso\n&gt; &gt; that it can be run by any test runner ...\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ... and this is Cactus ! :-)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; To summarise :\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; - yes Cactus can be a simple as what you describe (this is actually\na\n&gt; &gt; feature of version 1.4, which is not released yet - but soon to be)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; - it allow for more should you need it\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; - it is documented and there are resources on Cactus : website +\nbooks +\n&gt; &gt; articles\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; - BTW, Cactus integrates completely with Ant to automated start up\nand\n&gt; &gt; shutdown of application servers\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;/biased&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Yes, I am the original author of Cactus and thus I am biased :-) but\nas\n&gt; &gt; a user I would always go with existing framework if I find any that\n&gt; &gt; perform what I want. For example, I wouldn&#39;t dare write my logging\n&gt; &gt; framework, MVC controller one, XML to Java mapping one, etc.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; In the end it is your choice. I&#39;m just writing this email so that\nyou\n&gt; &gt; know Cactus does what you want and that you shouldn&#39;t skip it\nbecause\n&gt; &gt; you think it doesn&#39;t.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Cheers,\n&gt; &gt; -Vincent\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; &gt; &gt; From: Michael Rettig [mailto:mrettig@...]\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Sent: 13 July 2002 02:45\n&gt; &gt; &gt; To: junit@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Subject: RE: [junit] Testing a class inside an Application Server\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; From: &quot;Nicholas Lesiecki&quot; &lt;nick@...&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; What you describe sounds very similar to Cactus:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; http://jakarta.apache.org/cactus/\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Have you looked at it?\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Yes, and what I&#39;m describing is far simpler than Cactus. There is\nno\n&gt; &gt; &gt; framework to speak of. Just a servlet that knows how to run a test\n&gt; &gt; suite\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and return the results as xml. For instance, you would pass this\nURL\n&gt; &gt; to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; your browser to run the tests in a remote app server.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; http://localhost:8080/junit?classname=com.package.test.TestCase\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; It is very simple, but powerful. Since the test executes within\nthe\n&gt; &gt; &gt; servlet container you can access all the facilities of the app\nserver.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; We&#39;ve also automated the startup and shutdown of the app server,\nso\n&gt; &gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; entire test process is completely scripted. This makes it simple\nto\n&gt; &gt; plug\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the whole process into our cruise control build process.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Mike\n&gt; &gt; &gt; --\n&gt; &gt; &gt; __________________________________________________________\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Sign-up for your own FREE Personalized E-mail at Mail.com\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; http://www.mail.com/?sr=signup\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Save up to $160 by signing up for NetZero Platinum Internet\nservice.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; http://www.netzero.net/?refcd=N2P0602NEP8\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ------------------------ Yahoo!
