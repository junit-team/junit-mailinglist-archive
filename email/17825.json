Particularly in the area of visibility.. many developers assume <br/>\n&gt; that no written agreement can be sufficient if something is made <br/>\n&gt; public.  I think that the issue is that we are not used to thinking <br/>\n&gt; about agreements beyond the code and we&#39;re not used to holding people to <br/>\n&gt; them.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>An agreement might work. I&#39;ve never seen anyone try one. Instead what <br/>\nI&#39;ve seen is the developers issue pronouncements from on high about how <br/>\nusers must use their software and APIs, and then be appalled when users <br/>\nignore them. Actually sitting down and invoking the users in the design, <br/>\nand getting their explicit buy-in would be an interesting exercise. Hmm, <br/>\nyou know I have seen that and I have even done that, but only with a <br/>\nsmall subset of the user base. For a project with a large user base, I <br/>\ndon&#39;t think you could ever expect meaningful discussion and agreement <br/>\nwith each individual user.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow I&#39;m not objecting to pronouncements, mind you. I&#39;m a very <br/>\npatriarchical designer in my own APIs, and I make lots of pronouncements <br/>\nfrom on high. However I don&#39;t delude myself that the users have somehow <br/>\nagreed to this. That&#39;s why I enforce the pronouncements in code.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n﻿Elliotte Rusty Harold  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:elharo@...\">elharo@...</a><br/>\nJava I/O 2nd Edition Just Published!<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.cafeaulait.org/books/javaio2/\">http://www.cafeaulait.org/books/javaio2/</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0596527500/ref=nosim/cafeaulaitA/\">http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0596527500/ref=nosim/cafeaulaitA/</a></div>",
