Sorry.  I was really laughing at myself because I imagined you to\nbe a 5 ft. 165 lbs. man of French and Russian descent with a fairly\nthick salt and pepper beard and a thick French accent.  I think that\nimpression comes from a coworker who was 5 ft. 165 lbs. man of French\nand Russian descent with a fairly thick salt and pepper beard and a\nthick French accent, whose name was Vladimir Pierot.\n\nSorry again if I sounded offensive.\n\n=jason\n\nOn Thu, 2003-04-24 at 08:23, Jason Rogers wrote: Hee-hee...

Is it a presentation issue\n(which could be a strength)?  Are there other strengths?\n\n=jason\n\nOn Thu, 2003-04-24 at 00:41, Vladimir R.
