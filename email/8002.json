The name passed to the TestCase is originally <br/>\n&gt; the name of the test method that will be executed.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; so you see that overwriting runTest will not prevent the setUp and <br/>\n&gt; tearDown methods to be invoked.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It does not keep them from being invoked, but they only get invoked<br/>\nonce per TestCase, not before and after each test method. Perhaps I<br/>\nwas not clear when I stated what I was looking for. I want the behavior<br/>\nthat is:<br/>\n<br/>\nsetUp() -&gt; first test -&gt; tearDown()<br/>\nsetUp() -&gt; next test -&gt; tearDown()<br/>\n...<br/>\nsetUp() -&gt; last test -&gt; tearDown()<br/>\n<br/>\nBut overriding runTest() produces:<br/>\n<br/>\nsetUp() -&gt; first test -&gt; next test -&gt; last test -&gt; tearDown()<br/>\n<br/>\nOnly calling setUp() once before all testXXX() methods, and<br/>\ntearDown() once after all testXXX() methods. The JUnit 3.8.1<br/>\nJavaDoc for TestCase shows the overriding of runTest(), as well<br/>\nas at least one of the other HTML files in the doc/ directory<br/>\nof the 3.8.1 download (I don&#39;t remember which one off hand).<br/>\n<br/>\nI did see the TestCase source you mention above for runBare(),<br/>\nbut as usual it didn&#39;t register to me quite the way it did when<br/>\nyou put it here, isolated from the rest of the class. Don&#39;t you<br/>\njust love pair programming? &lt;G&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI think I have figured out how this is supposed to work regarding<br/>\noverriding runTest(). To get setUp()/tearDown() called once per test<br/>\nmethod, only one test method should be added to runTest(), but use<br/>\nof suite() is required to make this behavior fluid.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as the name passed to the TestCase not being the test method<br/>\nname, that does work as in my example, if you override runTest().<br/>\nThe test method name can be passed to the constructor to invoke a<br/>\nsingle test method by the programmer, or by the framework when it<br/>\nis executing a TestSuite. At least that&#39;s what I see in the source<br/>\nand when running in the debugger.<br/>\n<br/>\nOnce again, lest y&#39;all think I&#39;m completely nuts, I wasn&#39;t advocating<br/>\nthis approach, just trying to understand the behavior since it is<br/>\nboth possible and documented in the JUnit files.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for all the help. Sorry for bogging things down with this<br/>\nsomewhat off the wall question.<br/>\n-- <br/>\nThanks,<br/>\nDerek Lane<br/>\n=====================================<br/>\n--- The Gunslinger<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:quikdraw@...\">quikdraw@...</a></div>",
