Typically, objects were being saved \nwith a &quot;created&quot; Date. We ended up having to pass the date to the \nmethods in question instead of instantiating the date inside the method \nin order to test effectively. Our whitebox tests with mocks were usually \nsucceeding, but the live integration tests with the database failed. \nSomehow it seems like a code smell, but fudging the comparison of two \ndates to ignore the milliseconds didn&#39;t seem right either.\n\nJohn\n\nJ. B. Rainsberger wrote:\n\n&gt;Lewis, Grant wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;It was the stupid milliseconds. I called toString() to compare the date\n&gt;&gt;strings instead of comparing the objects. The database load caused a\n&gt;&gt;millisecond mismatch with the original that was saved.\n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;\n-- \n---------------------------------------------------------\n Jentro Technologies GmbH\n John L.
