I find they\nrarely run the tests that are there, often check in\ncode that breaks the tests (but not the build), and\nthey very frequently add new code that&#39;s untested.\n\nI&#39;m not sure what to do.  I value the tests, and am\ntrying to do test-first development, but I&#39;m playing\ncatch-up with testing the other developer&#39;s code, or\nmore likely letting the coverage suffer.  We use EMMA\nfor code coverage, but I think I&#39;m the only one who\nlooks at the reports.\n\nSome parts of the code are not easy to test, and I\nsympathize with my coworkers on that account.  I just\ngot started with easymock to get better coverage for\nthe hard-to-test bits, but I&#39;m afraid I&#39;ll alienate my\nnon-test-infected coworkers even more by using it.\n\nAnyway, I don&#39;t have any answers really, but to answer\nthe OP&#39;s question I am &quot;really using JUnit during\ndevelopment&quot;, but there are certain pains involved. \nOn the whole I still think it&#39;s worth the effort, but\nI do wish the effort required was less.\n\n--- &quot;James P. Gunderson&quot; &lt;gunders@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt; Scary to step into the discussion at this point.\n&gt; \n&gt; But....\n&gt; \n&gt; We test everything we can test. We strive for the\n&gt; goal that nothing \n&gt; ships without complete automated tests. As a Java\n&gt; shop, we use JUnit.\n&gt; \n&gt; However, we do not use testing as a design tool. We\n&gt; use a spiral model \n&gt; built around testing and design and coding. Some\n&gt; code is written test \n&gt; first, some code is tested after it is written. All\n&gt; code is designed \n&gt; into the software structure before it is committed\n&gt; to source code. As \n&gt; long as the code is tested before it ships, we are\n&gt; confident that it \n&gt; works. But we do not do test first design.\n&gt; \n&gt; Jim\n&gt; \n&gt; -- \n&gt; James P.
