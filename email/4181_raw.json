We have been \ndeveloping our product for about two years now, and have been trying \nto be pretty good about the developmental practices.  We have coding \nstandards, good architecture and frameworks in place, and allot of \ntallented developers. What we don&#39;t have is a solid suite of unit \ntests.\n\nWhat happened is at the beginning of the project management was \nonboard with the schedule that we demanded that included time for \nbuilding the unit tests.  For about 6 month now that is no longer a \ncase.  We have not written unit tests for the past 6 month.  The \ntests that have been written are long out of sync. with the codebase, \nto the point where everyone has them excluded from compilation.\n\nI really would like us to get back on track and developer a better \nquality product; alos, god knows our QA need some help.\n\nAnyway, to keep a long story short, what I am looking for is for best \npractices and guidlines on developintg unit tests for various types \nof classes (Regular classes, Servlets, EJBs, MDBs, XML processing).  \nIs there a framework that somebody has developed on top of the JUnit.\nIf not, I would be glad to build one, assuming it will not require \ntoo much time.  Being a great fan of reuse, I would rather use an \nalready created testing framework.  JUnit is great, but it is very \nsimple and does not have guidance on testing Data Access code, ...\n\nIf any of you can give me a list of books, articles, code samples, \nreferences to other web-sites; I will greatly appreciate it.\nI am realy glad that people like Erich Gamma and Kent Beck are out \nthere to help the rest of us get our acts together; however, there is \nstill some much more that could be done to make life easier for \nfast-pased development teams like the one I am working for.\n\nRegards, Mikhail Shnayderman.\n\n\n\n\n\n",
