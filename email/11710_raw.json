Some of the other \nframeworks (utPLSQL, for example) already do this, but TextRunner \nseems to output next to nothing.\n\nIs there some setting or addon that we can use to have this \ninformation output as well? (Short of modifying the Assert class, of \ncourse.)\n\n(I know there is discussion about whether such output has value. The \nenvironment I&#39;m working in requires FDA-specified validation, and at \nleast the values being compared have to be reviewed by a human being \nbefore a final approval signature can be applied. Therefore, a \nsimple &quot;OK&quot; is insufficient to to pass review.)\n\nThank you for your insight!\n\nJeff\n\n\n\n\n",
