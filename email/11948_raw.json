This is a classic source of e=\r\nrror in software, and\n&gt; I would hate to see you present it to students as a=\r\n good idea.\n&gt; \n&gt; Also, in your example, the price can be wrong by up to 1% =\r\nin either\n&gt; direction! Is this really what you want? If the price comes bac=\r\nk as\n&gt; 7.93, that&#39;s good enough?! No way.\n\nThat depends on your need. Using=\r\n longs to represent everything in pennies fails when you are attempting to =\r\nuse multiple currencies. As an example from our product taken at today&#39;s ra=\r\nte.\n\n1 USD =3D 3.36820 PEN (Peru Nuevos Soles)\n\nThus a $10.56 transaction i=\r\ns S/35,57 (rounds up according to our local contact). So now that I have ta=\r\nken 100 transactions throughout the day I have S/355,70 in my cash drawer, =\r\nbut someone seeing it from the USD side will think that there is $105.60 in=\r\n the drawer - which converts into S/355,68. Thus the drawer doesn&#39;t balance=\r\n.\n\tNow add in the complexity that the purchaser in question wants to give y=\r\nou $5 and pay the rest in PEN (S/18,73). The customer loves this because th=\r\ne more USD they get in the better off they are (stable currency and all of =\r\nthat). Thus at the end of the day they might have PEN, USD, and EUR in thei=\r\nr drawer.\n\tNow all of this could be avoided if you accept 4 decimal digits =\r\nfor money - 1 away from your significant should cancel any rounding errors,=\r\n or you can get each transaction as an individual. However, if you only get=\r\n a lump long for the amount then it won&#39;t work.\n\nI have found BigDecimal is=\r\n actually very accurate when you initially load values into them using Stri=\r\nngs [new BigDecimal(&quot;10.56&quot;)], so I have been using them.\n\n\n\nChip\n-----\n&quot;Th=\r\ne reason the mainstream is thought of as a stream is because it&#39;s so shallo=\r\nw&quot; --George Carlin\n \n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: J.

If it&#39;s a book, then =\r\n\ncall it a book.\n\n&gt; Sudents should write the set and get methods and set va=\r\nlues\n&gt; correctly so this test is passed.\n&gt; \n&gt; Problem : - I want them to wo=\r\nrk through the exercises and tests one\n&gt; at a time, but the test class will=\r\n obviously not compile until all\n&gt; of the correct methods are in place in t=\r\nhe Book class.\n\nWhy is this a problem? That&#39;s part of test-driven developme=\r\nnt: you write \na test, then write enough code to make it /compile/, then ru=\r\nn the test \nand watch it fail, then write enough code to make the test pass=\r\n. That&#39;s \n&quot;textbook&quot; test-driven development, and exactly the way I teach i=\r\nt.\n\n&gt; Is my approach to this incorrect. Is there better way?\n\nWell, your co=\r\nde needed some work, but your approach is solid.\n\n&gt; Hope you can help.\n\nYou=\r\n be the judge. :)\n-- \nJ. B.
