I guess that won&#39;t make much sense unless you&#39;re familiar with the<br/>\ntrilogy &quot;The Restaurant at the End of the Universe&quot; by Douglas Adams. IMHO a<br/>\npretty funny series of books, including the answer to everything (which is<br/>\nwhere the suggestion for changing your signature came from).<br/>\n<br/>\nJason Rogers wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I think this issue stems more from the habit of using JUnit as an<br/>\n&gt; acceptance or interaction testing framework rather than just a unit<br/>\n&gt; testing framework.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; As far as unit tests go, I am 110% with you.  However, the design of<br/>\n&gt; JUnit has made it extremely simple to use for the other two types of<br/>\n&gt; testing I referred to.  That being said, I don&#39;t believe this request<br/>\n&gt; should be embodied in JUnit-proper.  Let it be an add-on feature.  I<br/>\n&gt; would even argue to remove TestSetup once people get used to using<br/>\n&gt; Vladimir&#39;s Add-Ons project in SourceForge (or sooner, since most folks<br/>\n&gt; won&#39;t embrace change without some force to move them from their current<br/>\n&gt; path -- the 2nd law of thermodynamics I believe).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; =jason<br/>\n&gt; [:question | ^One]<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: kentlbeck [mailto:kentbeck@...]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Monday, September 23, 2002 2:20 PM<br/>\n&gt; To: junit@yahoogroups.com<br/>\n&gt; Subject: [junit] Re: Adding setUp() and tearDown() to TestSuite<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --- In junit@y..., &quot;David Vydra&quot; &lt;yahoogroups@v...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I would like to get the group&#39;s opinion about adding setUp() and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; tearDown() methods to the TestSuite class. I think it has several<br/>\n&gt; &gt; advantages:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 1. It makes it similar to TestCase<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 2. It makes it easier for QA engineers, who may not feel<br/>\n&gt; comfortable<br/>\n&gt; &gt; with a decorator like TestSetup (no offense meant to QA engineers<br/>\n&gt; who<br/>\n&gt; &gt; do)<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 3. Sometimes you need to access the suite in the composite after<br/>\n&gt; it<br/>\n&gt; &gt; was wrapped in TestSetup.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The first design principle of xUnit (good or bad) is independence of<br/>\n&gt; tests. TestSetup is a step away from that, which I regret. The need<br/>\n&gt; for shared setup is IME always a design problem. Solving it by<br/>\n&gt; writing tests differently is the first step on a slippery slope to<br/>\n&gt; making the tests less valuable to programmers.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Kent<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Yahoo!
