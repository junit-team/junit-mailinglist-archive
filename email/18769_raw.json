Please look at this:\n   \n  import junit.framework.TestCase;\n  import org.junit.Test;\n  \n  public class MyTest extends TestCase {\n  @Test\n  public void foo() {\n  }\n  \n  }\n   \n  When I start this test, I get this error message: junit.framework.AssertionFailedError: No tests found in MyTest\n   \n  I run it on Eclipse 3.3 M4 with JUnit 4.2 in classpath.\n\n  As soon as I remove &quot;extends TestCase&quot;, the test runs with no error! But this behaviour is deadly for migrating from JUnit 3 to JUnit 4!\n   \n  I don&#39;t believe that Beck and Gamma did cause such migration problems. Or did they? If not, what is the solution?\n   \n  \nDavid Saff &lt;saff@...&gt; wrote:\n          Hans,\n\nThere may be ways to do what you want. I&#39;d like to be sure I know\nwhat that is, though. It sounds like you&#39;d like to use JUnit 4 to run\nJUnit 3 tests, but having the @Ignore annotation observed. Is this\ntrue? Are there other features you&#39;d like to be able to use? Thanks,\n\nDavid Saff\n\nOn 1/23/07, hans_schwaebli &lt;hans_schwaebli@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Our old JUnit tests are written for JUnit 3.8.1.\n&gt;\n&gt; They first extended TestCase. After we introduced JMock, all our\n&gt; TestCases extend MockObjectTestCase.\n&gt;\n&gt; This is because we extend from our own JUnit test helper class which\n&gt; extends from MockObjectTestCase.\n&gt;\n&gt; Now we use the .jar file from JUnit 4.2 and JMock 1.1.\n&gt;\n&gt; But only if we write new tests, which don&#39;t extend MockObjectTestCase\n&gt; and TestCase and insert the method below for Eclipse 3.1.2, the tests\n&gt; are run as JUnit 4 tests. Otherwise they are run as JUnit 3 tests.\n&gt;\n&gt; public static junit.framework.Test suite()\n&gt; {\n&gt; return new JUnit4TestAdapter(MyTest.class);\n&gt; }\n&gt;\n&gt; It would be much work to refactor our old test. I thought it would be\n&gt; easy to use the new JUnit 4 features on them like @Ignore.\n&gt;\n&gt; Why are our tests always run as JUnit 3 tests if they extend from\n&gt; TestCase? Does anyone has a solution for us for using the new JUnit 4\n&gt; features without refactoring our tests very much?\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
