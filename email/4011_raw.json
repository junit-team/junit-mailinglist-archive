You then \ninsert the data you will test.  Your data is not time dependant anymore. \nRemember that you are &quot;unit&quot; testing your application (i.e. testing that \nit does what it should do) and that your database can be in a \nnon-dynamic state.\n\nDatabase dependent: normally inserting data into a database if pretty \nsimple but it&#39;s true that if you plan to support Sybase, Oracle and \nmySQL, you may have to write 3 different scripts to populate your 3 \ndifferent databases.  But it must be done only once.\n\n&gt;     There is a line of thought that all you need to do is make sure your SQL\n&gt;     is valid. beyond that you&#39;re testing your database, not your method...\n\n\nIt also depends what you mean with a &quot;valid SQL statement&quot;.  Having a \nvalid SQL statement and having a SQL statement that does what it has to \ndo are two different things (or you never makes any mistake writing a \ncomplex SQL statement...).\n\nIf you have an object that can be saved, updated and retrieved from a \ndatabase, a nice way to test your SQL statement and your database is to:\n\n1. create an object with valid data\n2. store the object into the database\n3. retrieve from the database into another object\n4. compare that these two objects are equal\n\nYou haven&#39;t directly test your database, but how your objects are \nsaved/modified/retrieved from the database.  It will be easier to find \nproblems when the database model changes.\n\n-Vladimir\n\n-- \nVladimir Bossicard\nwww.bossicard.com\n\n\n",
