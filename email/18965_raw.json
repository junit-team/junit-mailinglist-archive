Another\n&gt; example.. a while ago\n&gt; &gt;&gt;I was talking to Ivan Moore (of Jester fame) and\n&gt; he was saying that he\n&gt; &gt;&gt;had an idea for a tool that would go through your\n&gt; Java code and\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&#39;privitize&#39; it; that is, make all methods private\n&gt; that could be\n&gt; &gt;&gt;private.  In the spirit of the thing he was\n&gt; thinking of calling it\n&gt; &gt;&gt;Thatcher :-)  We were talking about it with a few\n&gt; other people who, like\n&gt; &gt;&gt;me, are very annoyed by the fact that private gets\n&gt; in the way when its\n&gt; &gt;&gt;in someone else&#39;s mangled code and you don&#39;t have\n&gt; the opportunity to\n&gt; &gt;&gt;peel it off, and we thought, well, wouldn&#39;t it be\n&gt; nice if your\n&gt; &gt;&gt;environment just told you which methods weren&#39;t\n&gt; used elsewhere in the\n&gt; &gt;&gt;system?  Sort of, &quot;this one could be private if\n&gt; you wanted it to be.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;    \n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Michael,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Very interesting.  Are you suggesting this tool\n&gt; would allow you to\n&gt; &gt;make more things private, or allow you to leave\n&gt; fewer things private,\n&gt; &gt;while still having the documentary benefit from the\n&gt; IDE of an &quot;only\n&gt; &gt;used locally&quot; marker?\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; You could use it either way and as long as a\n&gt; language has private, \n&gt; people would probably move to one or the other\n&gt; style.\n&gt; \n&gt; I think that the core issue behind all of this is\n&gt; what we choose to \n&gt; think of as the program.  For languages like Java\n&gt; which are file-based, \n&gt; that have representation outside the IDE, I suppose\n&gt; there will always be \n&gt; people who want to see those semantics in the\n&gt; source.  The thing that is \n&gt; interesting to consider, though, is that if our IDEs\n&gt; can infer this \n&gt; information, is there much merit in the idea of\n&gt; having the programmer \n&gt; specify it?  Could it be enough to say, well, you\n&gt; can access whatever \n&gt; you want, but the uses will be immediately apparent\n&gt; when people look at \n&gt; the code.\n&gt; \n&gt; Typing &#39;private&#39; is a like a little ritual.  You are\n&gt; documenting a \n&gt; decision.  But, if you have control over the code,\n&gt; you can &quot;untype&quot; it \n&gt; whenever you want to.  This is pretty much the same\n&gt; as having the IDE \n&gt; infer it for you.  The only way that private has\n&gt; teeth is when you don&#39;t \n&gt; have control over the code that uses it.  And, as a\n&gt; guy who runs into \n&gt; testing dilemmas all the time, I have to say that\n&gt; those teeth feel very \n&gt; sharp.\n&gt; \n&gt; One way out of this might be to let IDEs manage\n&gt; private the way that \n&gt; Eclipse manages imports.  I haven&#39;t thought that\n&gt; through yet.. might be \n&gt; neat though.\n&gt; \n&gt; Michael Feathers\n&gt; http://www.objectmentor.com\n&gt; http://michaelfeathers.typepad.com\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n\n \n____________________________________________________________________________________\nNow that&#39;s room service!
