But, in the spirit of our mythical \nprogrammer who writes her code and then presses the &#39;Generate Tests&#39; \nbutton; it would not be unlikely for the entire package to have 5000 \ntests generated. This is great - we want lots of tests - provided we \ndon&#39;t have to go through all the passing tests to see which are \ncorrectly testing invalid code. Clearly she is going to do incremental \nbuild and test, but all those tests have to be looked at eventually. \nThat is why I proposed the guidance to tell the test generator &#39;I don&#39;t \ncare what I actually wrote, this is what the code is supposed to do.&#39; \nWith the inclusion of that kind of guidance, the 100% testing with zero \n(programmer) effort may be possible.\n\n &gt; This fits well with the notion that testing is about\n &gt; good design.\n &gt;\n &gt; Good design is easy to validate by the developer.\n\nOn an academic note, are you sure that &quot;good design is easy to \nvalidate&quot;?  I&#39;ve certainly been in some animated discussions in which it \nwas hard to reach agreement :-)\n\nThanks,\nJim\n-- \nJames P.
