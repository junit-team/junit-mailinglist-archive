Assuming that I have such a servlet, what do <br/>\nI need to do to capture the results at some instance.  Right now I am <br/>\nusing TestResult class to store the results and then passing them as <br/>\nresponse to the browser after all the test cases are run.  But in <br/>\nthis case do I need to use TestListener interface and then use the <br/>\naddListener method of TestResult class.  Please let me know.<br/>\n<br/>\nthanks,<br/>\nSri<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In junit@y..., Jason Rogers &lt;jacaetev@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --- sramaswa007@y... wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Hi All,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;   I am designing a project to run junit test cases from the <br/>\nbrowser.  <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Basically the user is given a form where in he types in the test <br/>\n&gt; &gt; class he wants to run and clicks the submit button. <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; The test case class is called and the results are returned back <br/>\nto <br/>\n&gt; &gt; the browser.  I am fine till that part as I am able to call the <br/>\n&gt; &gt; appropriate test case entered by the user and am able to display <br/>\nthe <br/>\n&gt; &gt; results on the browser.  <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; What I also need is that, is there a way to determine and print <br/>\nwhat <br/>\n&gt; &gt; test case methods are being run.  As in case of the swingui <br/>\n&gt; &gt; (junit.swingui.TestRunner) we have the progress bar indicator <br/>\nthat <br/>\n&gt; &gt; tells us how many test cases are run, the failures and errors and <br/>\nthe <br/>\n&gt; &gt; stack trace.  Right now I am able to get all the results but once <br/>\nall <br/>\n&gt; &gt; the test cases have finished running, till then the page <br/>\ndisplayed to <br/>\n&gt; &gt; the user is blank.  Is there anyway to dynamically show which <br/>\nmethod <br/>\n&gt; &gt; in the test case is running and whether its a failure or error or <br/>\n&gt; &gt; success.  Please let me know.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Thanks,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Sri<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Sri,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Sure this is possible.  But you are limited here by things <br/>\nextraneous to JUnit.<br/>\n&gt;  For instance, the success of the dynamic updating (i.e. the client <br/>\nseeing it<br/>\n&gt; in realtime) is going to depend on the speed of both the webserver <br/>\nand the<br/>\n&gt; browser.  So, you may never really reach a realtime effect in the <br/>\nbrowser. <br/>\n&gt; However, I suspect that this will generally be run in a business <br/>\nenvironment,<br/>\n&gt; so the speeds of the machines should be sufficient enough to <br/>\n_simulate_<br/>\n&gt; realtime.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; To dynamically update a page requires that you have a little more <br/>\nmagic than<br/>\n&gt; normal going on.  There will of necessity be some software on the <br/>\nclient side<br/>\n&gt; that will cause the client&#39;s browser to &quot;continuously&quot; reload.  You <br/>\ncan feed<br/>\n&gt; pages up to the server until your heart is content, but if the <br/>\nclient never<br/>\n&gt; requests them, it does no good.  I am not sure whether you can <br/>\naccomplish this<br/>\n&gt; through an applet, having never used them.  It seems to me that you <br/>\ncould write<br/>\n&gt; some script or a servlet to update every 5 seconds or so, or you <br/>\ncould just do<br/>\n&gt; this in the HTML (which is not so clean).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; All of that being said, is it really necessary to to have this kind <br/>\nof<br/>\n&gt; interface?  What&#39;s the motive?  Are the tests running on a server <br/>\nthat you want<br/>\n&gt; all clients to be able to see?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -jason<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; =====<br/>\n&gt; Jason Rogers<br/>\n&gt; [mailto: jacaetev@y...]<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Keep it simple...<br/>\n&gt; (1 Corinthians 2:2, Galatians 2:20, 6:14)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; __________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; Do You Yahoo!?<br/>\n&gt; Make a great connection at Yahoo!
