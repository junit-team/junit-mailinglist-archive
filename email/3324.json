But somehow moving the clases into another project broke <br/>\nsomething in junit.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe packagenames of these classes are still the same as they were <br/>\nbefore. I read the FAQ about problems people have had with the <br/>\nswingui testrunner not working when the textui testrunner works <br/>\nfine... Last week, I had the same problem (classcast exception - with <br/>\nObjectivity, not ObjectStore) that was described in the FAQ, and so I <br/>\nmade up an exclude.properties file which fixed that problem already.<br/>\n<br/>\n#<br/>\n# The list of excluded package paths for the TestCaseClassLoader<br/>\n#<br/>\nexcluded.0=sun.*<br/>\nexcluded.1=com.sun.*<br/>\nexcluded.2=org.omg.*<br/>\nexcluded.3=javax.*<br/>\nexcluded.4=sunw.*<br/>\nexcluded.5=java.*<br/>\nexcluded.6=com.objy.*<br/>\nexcluded.7=com.archiserve.*<br/>\nexcluded.8=COM.odi.*<br/>\n<br/>\nBut now, when I try to run a test under the swingUI,<br/>\nI get the following error, printed in the bottom status bar, in red.<br/>\n<br/>\nFailed to invoke suite():java.lang.VerifyError:<br/>\n(class:com/archiserve/dal/test/TestOid, method: putObject signature()<br/>\nV) Incompatible object argument for function call<br/>\n<br/>\njust fyi, testOid is a test suite in its own right, and I was trying <br/>\nto run a suite of suites there via TestEverything.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I try to run TestOid directly, it just hangs when trying to load <br/>\nthe test case.<br/>\n<br/>\nClicking the &quot;reload classes every run&quot; doesn&#39;t seem to do anything.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut again, all works fine under the textui testrunner.<br/>\n<br/>\nAny other ideas?</div>",
