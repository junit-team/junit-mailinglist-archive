JUnit is maintained by volunteers=\r\n, and\nsometimes our day jobs get busy. I was waiting for David to respond (=\r\nI am a\nsometimes contributor) but here are my thoughts.\n\nThis is an interes=\r\nting idea. Note that you could get what you want with a\ncustom runner.\n\nMy =\r\nconcern with adding Rules via system properties that someone running the\nte=\r\nsts in their IDE would see different results compared to the test runs\nfrom=\r\n Maven. Sure, you could tell your IDE to run the tests with the same\nsystem=\r\n properties, but it would be unexpected for most people to have to\ntake a s=\r\npecial step to make the tests run the same way as they did in the\ncontinuou=\r\ns build.\n\nCould you find some way to define the global rules via code? Perh=\r\naps you\ncould add a DynamicRule to all of your tests that could apply the a=\r\nddition\nrules. Alternatively, you could have a class in the same package as=\r\n the\ntests that defined the global rules for tests in that package (though =\r\nI&#39;m\nnot sure there is a platform-independent way to scan all of the classes=\r\n in\na package that works for all runtime/deployment environments)\n\n-- Kevin=\r\n\n\n\nOn Mon, Apr 29, 2013 at 7:09 AM, Henning Gro=DF &lt;igaffai@...&gt;=\r\nwrote:\n\n&gt; **\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi!\n&gt; I have a use-case where I need to enable rules bas=\r\ned on external\n&gt; parameters. Therefore I cannot activate them in code. I ha=\r\nve submitted a\n&gt; pull request:\n&gt;\n&gt; https://github.com/junit-team/junit/pull=\r\n/668/files\n&gt;\n&gt; There are some little things to fix but its an easy and func=\r\ntional\n&gt; extension. Anyone mind to fix the code to a state that will get me=\r\nrged? I\n&gt; did not get any feedback until now. Whole team in holidays?\n&gt;\n&gt; A=\r\nlso I am wondering when 4.12 will be released. Any plans?\n&gt;\n&gt; Regards and t=\r\nhank you!\n&gt; Henning.\n&gt;\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been remov=\r\ned]\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n",
