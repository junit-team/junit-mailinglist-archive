I think the best way to present my\n&gt;  confusion is to show to you an example where I think it would be perfectly\n&gt;  reasonable to not run some tests, because I know the _will_ fail if one\n&gt;  other fails:\n&gt;\n&gt;  I&#39;m developing a system that handles (among others, but quite extensively)\n&gt;  persistence of java objects to a database. I&#39;ve built test cases for some\n&gt;  (far too few, but that&#39;s another problem) of the functionality, most of\n&gt;  which of course need a properly configured Database conection. Now I also\n&gt;  got a test that checks to see if the system can successfully connect to\n&gt;  the database. If this case fails then there are about 130 other tests that\n&gt;  will not produce anything useable. It would probably be possible to mock\n&gt;  the Database, but I can&#39;t really imagine how (without makeing the Mock so\n&gt;  unstable, that it won&#39;t help).\n&gt;\n&gt;  What would you do about these tests in this case? Or am I talking about\n&gt;  something completely different?\n\nI would mock it.  Hopefully, the database access is isolated enough that you \ncan do this.  The point is that there is code that is &quot;figuring&quot; out what \nneeds to be persisted and how.  You want to test that.  Your test of that \nisn&#39;t interested in whether or not the database actually received said \npersistence (those are other tests).  So, I would want those tests to \npass/fail on their own merit, not based on whether or not a DB was properly \nconfigured.  But again, perhaps I am just old-fashioned. ;)\n\n-- \nJason Rogers\n117 N. First Street\nSuite 90\nAnn Arbor, MI 48104\n\nTel 734.302.7694\nFax 734.302.7694\nCel 734.846.5089\n\n",
