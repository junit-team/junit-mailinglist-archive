First, the naming convention tells<br/>\n&gt; &gt; you that a method is a constructor. Understanding Java should tell you<br/>\n&gt; &gt; everything you need to know about why that method is there. A<br/>\n&gt; &gt; constructor&#39;s job is to ensure that an object is usable and &quot;ready to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; rock&quot; when it&#39;s handed off. Part of an object being &quot;ready to rock&quot;,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; is that it should be fully loaded and in a guaranteed valid state.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Telling people to do the least amount possible in a constructor is<br/>\n&gt; &gt; encouraging them to hand out objects that are (potentially) in an<br/>\n&gt; &gt; invalid internal state. That will get you a &quot;reading of the riot act&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; on any project that I&#39;m leading. An object must _always_ have a valid<br/>\n&gt; &gt; internal state. As programs run in more and more multithreaded<br/>\n&gt; &gt; environments these days, this rule becomes even more important. You<br/>\n&gt; &gt; _never_ know when your object might be accessed, therefore it should<br/>\n&gt; &gt; _always_ be ready for access.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; You know, I almost said this myself, but I think point 5 implicitly<br/>\n&gt; addresses this. I suspect this could be made a little clearer in the<br/>\n&gt; article, but I&#39;m not really sure the author and you actually disagree here.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Point five does agree with the second half of my statement. But I<br/>\nremain resolute that a constructor&#39;s _responsibility_ is to return an<br/>\nobject that is ready to be used _and_ that has a valid internal state.<br/>\nPoint five does not address this specific aspect.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Point five. I agree up to a point. There will always be some things<br/>\n&gt; &gt; that need to be done in specific sequences. Opening and closing files<br/>\n&gt; &gt; leaps to mind at this point.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; However this can conflict with your response to point 1. What if a<br/>\n&gt; constructor needs to open a file? And for that matter why do files have<br/>\n&gt; to be opened anyway? Perhaps file writes and reads should auto-open and<br/>\n&gt; close files as necessary. We used to think we had to explicitly allocate<br/>\n&gt; and free memory, but we don&#39;t do that any more. Why do we treat files<br/>\n&gt; the same way?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t see how this conflicts with my first point, but the rest of<br/>\nyour thought is an excellent point and one that many scripting<br/>\nlanguages have been pushing with the behaviour of closures operating<br/>\nagainst files. There may be times when you want to do some funky file<br/>\nhandling logic, but most of the time, you just want to process each<br/>\nbyte/character/line and be done with it.<br/>\n<br/>\nSimon<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nwww.simonpeter.org</div>",
