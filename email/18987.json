I just want them tested with minimum effort<br/>\nrequired to test them, while keeping the tests tightly<br/>\nlinked with the build process, so that the tests are<br/>\nalways testing what will run in production.<br/>\n  <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; a) as already mentioned by others, see if there is<br/>\n&gt; some way you can<br/>\n&gt; structure your code so that you can implicitly test<br/>\n&gt; whats private with<br/>\n&gt; little effort. <br/>\n&gt;As has already been suggested your<br/>\n&gt; *Helper may want to<br/>\n&gt; have different names, some may want to be merged,<br/>\n&gt; some broken up. And<br/>\n&gt; according to my taste stop being static and then<br/>\n&gt; injected to the class<br/>\n&gt; you want to test.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I usually inject the *Class, but the *ClassHelper has<br/>\nall static methods.  It&#39;s methods receive all<br/>\narguments from the *Class.  It&#39;s a &quot;Private&quot; utility<br/>\nlibrary so to speak.  Only the *Class stores state.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; A lot of good stuff can be found here:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote><a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.objectmentor.com/resources/publishedArticles.html\">http://www.objectmentor.com/resources/publishedArticles.html</a><br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; (click on by topic  | design)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Thanks for the link.  I&#39;ll have a look.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I would start looking at the single responsibility<br/>\n&gt; principle. That is<br/>\n&gt; in my experience the principle that had the biggest<br/>\n&gt; impact on my<br/>\n&gt; unit-testing (together with the depenency inversion<br/>\n&gt; principle).<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yes - I think Dependency Injection rocks.  I also like<br/>\nseparation of concerns and single responsibility.  A<br/>\nfew of the reasons I like Class + ClassHelper is that<br/>\nClassHelper is unique to Class, and ClassHelper<br/>\nmethods can be easily moved to a utility library<br/>\nlater, with a minimum amount of refactoring, along<br/>\nwith the corresponding tests.  It also keeps Class<br/>\nvery clean and focused.  When I look at Class, I see<br/>\nprecisely what it does, without a lot of clutter.  It<br/>\nstores state, and has a few methods that are focused<br/>\non it&#39;s core concern/responsibility/role.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; b) consider making them package-private or default<br/>\n&gt; if you prefer to<br/>\n&gt; call it that (remove the private, protected, public<br/>\n&gt; modifier<br/>\n&gt; entirely). This is just above private, these methods<br/>\n&gt; are only<br/>\n&gt; accessible by other classes in the same package. Not<br/>\n&gt; even subclasses<br/>\n&gt; can access them if they are in a different package<br/>\n&gt; (there is a common<br/>\n&gt; misunderstanding that default  less restricted than<br/>\n&gt; protected, it&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; really the other way around.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Thanks for the review :-)  I think it would be great<br/>\nto have cheat sheet for that one :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nI like to have my tests in separate packages<br/>\nsometimes, and sometimes in separate projects, so that<br/>\nmakes it a little trickier.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; c) perform securitymanager stunts to acces the<br/>\n&gt; actual private methods.<br/>\n&gt; I would consider this a bit paranoid.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yeah - I think even if the the private / protected /<br/>\ndefault access constraints could could be turned off<br/>\nin the JVM for testing, I may still stick with Class +<br/>\nClassHelper for reasons I specify at the end.<br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I look at both b) and c) as workarounds. Sometimes<br/>\n&gt; we need workarounds<br/>\n&gt; until we figure out how everything should fit.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Of course, if you are comfortable with the helper<br/>\n&gt; style, by all means<br/>\n&gt; continue with that. From where I&#39;m standing it looks<br/>\n&gt; like it is the<br/>\n&gt; design part of TDD that wants to be listened to. I<br/>\n&gt; am standing quite<br/>\n&gt; far away though so I may be wrong.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I think you hit the nail on the head :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nI think designs that result from test driven<br/>\ndevelopment are clean, simple, and easy to work with<br/>\nand improve.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe tests are also a great source of documentation.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also prefer to minimize the amount of code in the<br/>\n&quot;Core Project&quot; and utilize utility libraries as much<br/>\nas possible.  This means less documentation effort and<br/>\nmore utility libraries for everyone to use.  Less<br/>\ncoding too.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I try to move methods to utilities as much as<br/>\npossible.  Using the Helper makes it easy for myself<br/>\nand others to do this, when working in teams.  Also,<br/>\nthe overhead  of wondering &quot;How should we structure<br/>\nthis so we can test everything&quot; is eliminated.  We<br/>\njust say <br/>\n<br/>\nClass + Helper :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers,<br/>\n- Ole<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; /J<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; On 2/21/07, Ole Ersoy &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ole_ersoy@...\">ole_ersoy@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Yes - I assumed parts of the &quot;All Methods Public&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; thread in here.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; To summarize:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; By putting methods on a Helper and making them<br/>\n&gt; public<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m simulating being able to turn off<br/>\n&gt; &gt; private/protected checking on methods in the JVM,<br/>\n&gt; so<br/>\n&gt; &gt; that all methods can be easily tested and receive<br/>\n&gt; the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; benefits of test driven development, while keeping<br/>\n&gt; the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; tests tightly linked to the methods they are<br/>\n&gt; testing.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Cheers,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; - Ole<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; --- CÃ(c)dric Beust â&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:cbeust@...\">cbeust@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; On 2/20/07, Ole Ersoy &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ole_ersoy@...\">ole_ersoy@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Or do it in reverse.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Declare private methods on the Class, and have<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; builder create the ClassHelper.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I&#39;m a bit confused where this discussion is<br/>\n&gt; going.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; If my class needs helper methods that it will be<br/>\n&gt; the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; only one using, I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; make them private on that same class (ideally,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; static private if they<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; don&#39;t modify any state).<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Only if these helper methods can be useful to<br/>\n&gt; other<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; classes would I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; consider extracting them in a separate Helper<br/>\n&gt; class.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; --<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Cédric<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://testng.org\">http://testng.org</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>__________________________________________________________<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; Never miss an email again!<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Yahoo!
