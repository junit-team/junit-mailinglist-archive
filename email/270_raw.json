One was from the\n&gt; ClassLoader (which is different in 3.4 than earlier revs) and could be\n&gt; environmental. My suggestion: disable the class loader using the\n&gt; excluded.properties.\n&gt;\n&gt; The other two errors were bad returns that look just like the result of\n&gt; a bug in the current Linux JVM from Sun. JVM bugs do not necessarily\n&gt; cause crashes. This is a known bug at java.sun.com.\n&gt;\n&gt; Regards,\n&gt;\n&gt; Rob\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; __________________________________________________\n&gt; Do You Yahoo!?\n&gt; Yahoo!
