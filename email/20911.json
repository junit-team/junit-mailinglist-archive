Since simply the level of the tests is not<br/>\nsufficient to decide where to test, I thought a bit more about how I should<br/>\ndecide where to test. I came to three criteria:<br/>\n  * The cost of writing and running the test<br/>\n  * The stability of the interface the test is, errr..., testing<br/>\n  * The reliability of the code satisfying the test<br/>\n<br/>\nI wrote this up in a little paper:<br/>\nwww.threeriversinstitute.org/WhereToTest.html. Comments welcome.<br/>\n<br/>\nKent Beck<br/>\nThree Rivers Institute</div>",
