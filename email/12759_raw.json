I was looking to create a data-driven test\nsuite  but the Ant reporting options aren&#39;t able to represent this\nhierarchy. \n\nSo I looked at the Swing UI Test Runner source, which has it&#39;s own\nimplementation, as does the Eclipse version as well, which build their\nown hierarchy. I had a look at the code in JUnit and it looked as\nthough adding appropriate methods to TestSuite, TestResult and\nTestListener could easily create a way of representing hierarchies to\nall listeners. Obviously, you may want to provide a a new\nTestListener2 interface, or something to maintain binary\ncompatibility, but I was wondering it anyone else has ever hit this? I\ncould of course provide a patch and tests to interested parties.\n\nCheers,\n\nJames\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
