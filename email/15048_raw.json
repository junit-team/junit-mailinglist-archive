So, it would \nmake sense to have these parameters passed to the test method (like it \nis done in TestNG).\n\n  Second limitation is that user don&#39;t have will have to declaratively \nspecify test data sets without writing custom @Parameters method and use \nsome system property to differentiate between tests. Perhaps you can add \nsome &quot;name&quot; property to Parameters annotation, so test runner can match \nthis name with declared test data. Such name property would also allow \nto have multiple @Parameters methods and match them with @Test methods \nif you&#39;ll have same name there too. The last would allow to have several \ntest methods with different kinds of test parameters without creating \nseparate test classes (so you&#39;ll have single test class for class under \ntesting).\n\n  The last thing I&#39;d like to mention is that current @Parameters methods \nwon&#39;t scale to large data sets (the same limitation also exists in \nTestNG). I&#39;ve seen JUnit3 suite() methods that produced thousands of \ntest permutations and that required lots of memory memory when running \ntests. So, It think that it would make sense to introduce an interface \nsimilar to JDBC ResultSet, so test runner can create iterate trough test \ndata without loading it completely into memory and also have option to \nget number of tests as well as jump to Nth test. You can also provide an \nadapter that will take Object[][] and provide all that functionality for \nusers who don&#39;t want to create test data dynamically.\n\n  regards,\n  Eugene\n\n\n&gt; Elliotte,\n&gt;\n&gt; Parameterized tests violate an assumption in JUnit that some of which \n&gt; JUnit GUIs\n&gt; depend on, that tests can be uniquely identified by a class and method \n&gt; name.\n&gt; However, I can see that they are potentially useful. One question is \n&gt; whether to\n&gt; add functionality to JUnit only at a speed the test runners can match \n&gt; or march\n&gt; ahead, accepting that temporarily-poor GUI support is the price of \n&gt; architectural\n&gt; progress. Having not changed JUnit much in years, I am ready to move \n&gt; forward.\n&gt;\n&gt; Here is a revised parameterized test proposal for comment. Three \n&gt; things have\n&gt; changed.\n&gt; * The class is now annotated with a class used to run it:\n&gt; @Factory(Parameterized.class). This seems like a very general \n&gt; mechanism to me.\n&gt; For example, I was able to write a test runnerlet to run JUnit 3.x \n&gt; AllTests in a\n&gt; few minutes. Would JUnit extenders find this annotation generally helpful?\n&gt; * The data comes from a static method instead of a static field. A method\n&gt; seemed more general than a field and is evaluated later, when the test \n&gt; is run\n&gt; instead of when the class is loaded. Totally static data can be simply\n&gt; implemented by a method which just returns that data.\n&gt; * Parameters are passed to a constructor instead of stuffed into \n&gt; fields. This\n&gt; seems more general as well as reducing the number of annotations by \n&gt; one. One\n&gt; limitation of the current implementation is that parameterized test \n&gt; classes can\n&gt; only have a single constructor.\n&gt;\n&gt; Here is an example:\n&gt; @Factory(Parameterized.class) //TODO This shouldn&#39;t be called Factory, \n&gt; because\n&gt; it doesn&#39;t create anything. &quot;Runner&quot;, perhaps?\n&gt; public class FibonacciTest {\n&gt; @Parameters public static Object[] data() {\n&gt; return new int[][] {{0, 0}, {1, 1}, {2, 1}, {3, 2}, {4, 3}, {5, 5}, \n&gt; {6, 8}};\n&gt; }\n&gt;\n&gt; private int input;\n&gt; private int expected;\n&gt;\n&gt; public FibonacciTest(int input, int expected) {\n&gt; this.input= input;\n&gt; this.expected= expected;\n&gt; }\n&gt;\n&gt; @Test public void test() {\n&gt; assertEquals(expected, fib(input));\n&gt; }\n&gt;\n&gt; private int fib(int x) {\n&gt; return 0;\n&gt; }\n&gt; }\n&gt;\n&gt; Comments?\n\n\n\n\n\n",
