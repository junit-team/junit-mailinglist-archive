The parameterized tests are a bit more o=\r\nf a pain to set up;\n&gt; but they provide a little more control over how thing=\r\ns get matched up.\n&gt; Of course, theories allow for much more robust data set=\r\ns by combining\n&gt; all the data points in every way. This can provide an orde=\r\nr of\n&gt; magnitude more tests automatically, but care has to be taken. For\n&gt; =\r\nexample, the number of actual tests run is D^P where D is the number of\n&gt; d=\r\nata points and P is the number of parameters on any given theory. This\n&gt; ca=\r\nn generate a lot of tests quickly, and the &quot;runDiscretely&quot; option I\n&gt; hacke=\r\nd together for theories would definitely not be a preferable.\n&gt;\n&gt; I now kno=\r\nw that assumptions are filtering devices for theories, so it\n&gt; does not mar=\r\nk the test as failed. Essentially, the reason that an\n&gt; assumption is marke=\r\nd as passing for the theory is that the assumption\n&gt; successfully filtered =\r\nout that data combination. I get that now, but I\n&gt; probably will use that f=\r\neature very sparingly.\n&gt;\n&gt; The question I have is what problem was the reas=\r\non parameterized tests\n&gt; supposed to solve, and how is that different than =\r\nthe problem that\n&gt; theories are supposed to solve?\n&gt;\n&gt; [Non-text portions o=\r\nf this message have been removed]\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\n\n\n-- \n***C=E9dric\n*\n\n\n[Non-text =\r\nportions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n",
