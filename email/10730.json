If you desire to have his<br/>\n&gt; personal input it would behoove you to offer him payment for his<br/>\n&gt; services.  As I am sure you do not want to do that I respectfully<br/>\n&gt; suggest that you take what you can get.  This is a public forum and we<br/>\n&gt; all participate on a voluntary basis.  If you aren&#39;t getting an answer<br/>\n&gt; that satisfies then rephrase the question (as has been suggested).<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>That&#39;s what I was too lazy to say.
