Currently, I\n&gt; have static ArrayLists in my TestCase class. In the setUp method, I\n&gt; check if those ArrayLists are null, and if they are, load the test\n&gt; data. So, I only load the test data once but it seems messy to have\n&gt; test data loaded for the whole suite in a method intended to setup a\n&gt; single test method. I guess this data loading can be moved to the\n&gt; suite() method?\n\nAs the suite() method only gets invoked once per test class, this would be a\nplace you could do it. If you do so, you&#39;ll have to manage the test-suite\nyourself, however; the automatic discovery of tests via reflection will no\nlonger work.\n \n&gt; However, I still have to hardcode the name of the data file. The\n&gt; TestCase class has a main method and I tried passing the test file\n&gt; name as an argument to that however that simply runs TestRunner\n&gt; which creates a new instance of the TestCase and undoes my data\n&gt; loading. Is there a way to pass the name of the data file as an \n&gt; argument to TestRunner so it can be loaded when TestRunner calls\n&gt; suite()?\n\nNot in this version.\n \n&gt; If not, I guess I&#39;m looking for a setUp method for suites as well as\n&gt; test methods.\n\nWe implemented such a utility at my last place of employment. In hindsight,\nwhile it was fun and interesting, I consider the solution we used as\noverkill (but then, we had a lot of time on our hands).\n\nWhat I&#39;d suggest, with the benefit of hindsight, is a Singleton-like\npattern. Provide a utility class (possibly an inner class of the test class)\nwhich provides static methods for obtaining your data. The first time that\nthe methods are called (or via a static initialisor, if you prefer), read\nyour data in, and cache it for future requests.\n\nIf you are worried about hard-coding the name of the data file, don&#39;t be;\nfor your automated tests, you&#39;ll want the data in a known location. If you\nwant some configurability over the test, you can always store the location\nof the data file in a properties file.\n\nIf you&#39;re going to be using a known location for your automated test, but\nyou want to be able to override it (say, you&#39;ve got a data file that\nreproduces a problem and you want to look into it), I&#39;d suggest writing a\nmain() method in your test class that configures the Singleton object. If\nyou invoke the test case manually, you&#39;ll be able to provide the location.\nIf you invoke it via JUnit or via another suite(), you won&#39;t.\n\nRobert.\n\n-- \n     &quot;Duct tape is like the Force: it has a light side, a dark side,\n                   and it holds the universe together&quot;\n  Robert Watkins     robertdw@...     robertw@...\n\n\n\r\n------_=_NextPart_001_01C08FDC.7A177A70\r\nContent-Type: text/html;\n\tcharset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD HTML 3.2//EN&quot;&gt;\n&lt;HTML&gt;\n&lt;HEAD&gt;\n&lt;META HTTP-=\r\nEQUIV=3D&quot;Content-Type&quot; CONTENT=3D&quot;text/html; charset=3Diso-8859-1&quot;&gt;\n&lt;META N=\r\nAME=3D&quot;Generator&quot; CONTENT=3D&quot;MS Exchange Server version 5.5.2653.12&quot;&gt;\n&lt;TITL=\r\nE&gt;RE: [junit] passing arguments to TestRunner?&lt;/TITLE&gt;\n&lt;/HEAD&gt;\n&lt;BODY&gt;\n\n&lt;P&gt;&lt;=\r\nFONT SIZE=3D2&gt;Andy Kriger writes:&lt;/FONT&gt;\n&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT SIZE=3D2&gt;&gt; &lt;/FONT&gt;\n&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&lt;FONT SIZE=3D2&gt;&gt; I want to load a text file that contains data to test=\r\n.
