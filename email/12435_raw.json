The logging in the test cases is easy if you inherit fro=\r\nm their abc,\nit&#39;s just info(...), warn(...), etc. and there is other good s=\r\ntuff like\npartially ordered tests and closure exceptions. But there may be =\r\nother\nthings out there that I don&#39;t know about (fitness?)\n\nThe consensus se=\r\nems to be that jdk logging sucks big time (seems fine to me\nthough at first=\r\n blush)) and one should therefore use\nhttp://jakarta.apache.org/commons/log=\r\nging/ as it wraps log4j and jdk. \n\nI also have to deal with webmacro and it=\r\n&#39;s logging.\n\nMy first priority is doing the architecture for testing in a g=\r\nood way, so\nwhat do you guys think about this diasparsoft stuff? Have you f=\r\nound\nsomething better or equal but different? (I am introducing junit into =\r\na\nsmall .bomb that is not terribly agile (i.e. *no* tests) and has lot&#39;s of=\r\n\nyour typical many kloc servlets. So I can&#39;t get too carried away, but I\nwo=\r\nuld like to have some of the helper stuff in junit in whatever I can foist\n=\r\nupon them).\n\nAfter that, does the commons logging seem best and has anyone =\r\nused it with\nwebmacro? Or should I byte the bullet and say jdk all the way?=\r\n\n\nAny pointers will be appreciated.\n\nthanks \n---\nray tayek &lt;http://tayek.co=\r\nm/&gt;, co-chair &lt;http://www.ocjug.org/&gt;, actively \nseeking telecommuting work=\r\n.\n\n\n",
