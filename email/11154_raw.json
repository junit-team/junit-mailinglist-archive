So closer\n&gt;&gt;&gt; inspection of (1) I noted that I was actually wrapping a number of\n&gt;&gt;&gt; DocumentListeners to get the effect I desired - unfortunately I\n&gt;&gt;&gt; was add them in the wrong order.\n\nThomas L Roche Mon, 7 Jun 2004 13:40:42 -0400\n&gt;&gt; You might consider\n\n&gt;&gt; 4) expose API to getEffectDesired(...) and then \n&gt;&gt;    testGettingEffectDesired(...)\n\nJonathan Oddy Tue, 8 Jun 2004 09:34:39 +0100\n&gt; I&#39;m probably being thick, but I am not sure what you&#39;re getting at\n&gt; here, could you expand please?\n\nActually, presuming I guess correctly about what happened, you almost\nget it below:\n\n&gt; My confusion comes (I think) from the fact that I am trying to make\n&gt; my UI &quot;lightweight&quot; in terms of functionality embedded within it. So\n&gt; from that viewpoint the effect I am interested in is that my edit\n&gt; control behaves correctly. So the UI code becomes responsible for\n&gt; instantiating and using this text contol. Perhaps a better (more TDD\n&gt; friendly?) approach would be to realise that I needed a text control\n&gt; to be have in a certain manner and extract that from my UI and drive\n&gt; that? Having said that I&#39;d still probably have nested the\n&gt; construction of the DocumentListeners, so I&#39;d still end up with the\n&gt; same [quandary]\n\nRight, but presumably \n\n* there is a reason why you needed to&quot;nested the construction of the\n  DocumentListeners&quot; as you did. Presuming that non-atomic operation\n  is goal-directed, let&#39;s call its goal &quot;foo-optimality.&quot;\n\n* there is (at least one) right way and wrong way to attain\n  foo-optimality (as you have found)\n\n* your UI seeks to cause foo-optimality (bring to foo-ition ?-), and\n  possibly report on some aspect of foo-ness to the user.\n\nTherefore I&#39;m suggesting that you might want to consider if it&#39;s worth\nthe effort to\n\n&gt;&gt; 4) expose API to getEffectDesired() \n\n0 write some expressive, relatively-atomic API, e.g.\n  attainFooOptimality(...) that does what your UI wanted, and does it\n  correctly (darn those pesky DocumentListeners !-) This would\n  presumably be reusable in future (or is foo-optimality some passing\n  fancy?)\n\n&gt;&gt; and then testGettingEffectDesired()\n\n1 red/green/refactor that API\n\n2 call that API from your UI (&quot;lightening its weight&quot;)\n\nas well as keeping your implementation-neutral UI testcase, keeping in\nmind the correct, general rule that\n\nJ. B. Rainsberger Mon, 07 Jun 2004 18:11:30 -0400\n&gt; in the long run, and as a general practice, you /want/ both tests.\n\nas well as the facts that all practices are specific, and in the long\nrun, we&#39;re all dead :-)\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n",
