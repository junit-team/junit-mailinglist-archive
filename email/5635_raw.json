Just wanted to mention that \non the current project I&#39;m working on we just passed the 1000 test \nmark. :)  The tests take about two or three minutes to run, but \nthat&#39;s because we haven&#39;t gone back to refactor some of the tests \nthat are still nailing the database instead of using mocks or \nsomething.  Back when we were at the 400-500 mark, tests took almost \nsix minutes.  I went in, found the three tests that took the most \ntime, and changed them to use MockObjects...which reduced the time to \nrun considerably.\n\nI figure we&#39;ll probably hit the 2K mark before we&#39;re finished with \nthe initial project, and add even more tests when we go in and do \nsome major cleaning up.\n\n\n-Eric\n\n\n",
