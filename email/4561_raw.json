I don&#39;t see how JUnit is respon=\r\nsible for this smell,\n&gt; or a JUnit-based solution \n&gt; (like, say, hacking it=\r\n to use reflection in order to break access \n&gt; control) that doesn&#39;t bring =\r\nalong serious code smells of its own.\n\nThis problem is definitely not a JUn=\r\nit problem.  It is just that it\nwould be nice if JUnit could handle this pr=\r\noblem (Works Out of The\nBox[1]).\n\nAnother tension is that of consistency: i=\r\nf you code ALL your test\nclasses as Inner classes, you may well use them to=\r\n test private access\nmethods also.  If you don&#39;t, however, you add an extra=\r\n smell and\ninconsistent use of Inner/Test classes.  This could become a mai=\r\nntenance\nproblem.\n\n&gt; I rather liked JB Rainsberger&#39;s idea that the need to =\r\ntest a private \n&gt; method directly suggests refactoring it into a collaborat=\r\ning \n&gt; class. I&#39;m not sure it&#39;s universally applicable, but i do prefer \n&gt; =\r\nlooking for smells in my code rather than my tools.\n\nI also think that extr=\r\nacting some private behaviour into its own class\nis a good idea, and a good=\r\n design decision (at times).  It helps in\nmaintaining coherence: if a metho=\r\nd doesn&#39;t quite fit, move it to another\nclass.\n\nAnd although I also prefer =\r\ntaking the time going through my code, not\nthrough my tools, sometimes I wo=\r\nuld like to extend my tools with some\nfeatures that would help me work even=\r\n quicker (the reason I have tools\nin the first place).  This is why we shar=\r\ne our thoughts with others, to\nsee if it does seem like a useful feature (d=\r\nepending on votes in\nfavour).\n\n[May I add:  I actually practice testing pub=\r\nlic (i.e. non-private)\nmethods, and do not require the private testing func=\r\ntionality.  But I\nbelieve that it should be considered for those who may pr=\r\nefer to code\nthat way.  \n\nOT-- On this note: another topic that props up fr=\r\nequently is that of\nparallel source trees.  Some readers seem to have diffi=\r\nculties\nunderstanding this concept.  Is this mentioned in any of the existi=\r\nng\ndocumentation, and could a link be added on the welcome letter?  ]\n\n---\n=\r\n[1] The Selfish Class (http://www.laputan.org/selfish/selfish.html) or\nsear=\r\nch Google for the PDF.\n\n\nManuel Amago.\nmailto:mamago@...\n\n\n",
