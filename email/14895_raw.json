I cherish the discussion on this list\nabout meat=\r\ny topics of unit testing and using and extending JUnit.  There\nare some ver=\r\ny smart people here!\n\nHowever, I frankly have reached the limit of my toler=\r\nance for stupid\nquestions in this list.  And by &quot;stupid questions&quot; I mean t=\r\nhe opposite\nof Eric Raymond&#39;s &quot;smart questions&quot;\n(http://www.catb.org/~esr/f=\r\naqs/smart-questions.html).  There seems to be\nno end to the steady stream o=\r\nf new members who sign on and immediately\nask a question that&#39;s already ans=\r\nwered in the JUnit FAQ, which every new\nmember automatically receives.  I k=\r\nnow hitting the delete key 5 or 10\ntimes a day isn&#39;t a huge deal, so I gues=\r\ns it&#39;s just the principle of it\nall.  I consider it rude for people to not =\r\nhave the courtesy to at least\nmake an effort to help themselves.\n\nBut I tho=\r\nught that rather than just unsubscribing from the list, I&#39;d\ntoss this messa=\r\nge out to see if anyone else is in the same boat as me.\nThere are supposedl=\r\ny over 6000 subscribers, which sure sounds like a big\nenough population to =\r\nallow some specialization.  Alternatively, if\ndividing the junit@yahoogroup=\r\ns.com list isn&#39;t likely to happen, does\nanyone know of a similar forum for =\r\n&quot;intermediate-to-advanced&quot; users of\nJUnit with a better S/N ratio?\n\n\nThanks=\r\n for listening,\nTodd.\n----\nTodd Bradley - Polycom, Inc.\nTest Lead, Proximo =\r\nProjects\n\nVisit me at my WebOffice for IM and app sharing:\nhttp://www.polyc=\r\nomweboffice.com/todd.bradley@... \n\n\n\n",
