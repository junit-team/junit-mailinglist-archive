One of the concerns that I (and<br/>\n&gt; developers) have is that we will end up with thousands of test cases, many<br/>\n&gt; of which will involve using substantial amounts of MockObjects to set up<br/>\n&gt; test cases and that all this will become too much of an overhead to manage &<br/>\n&gt; maintain. Specifically,  that changing code in the future will involve<br/>\n&gt; analysis of not only the project code but also the junit test code - an<br/>\n&gt; overhead we don&#39;t have today of course.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Tests are not overhead; they are the safety net that /enables/ you to <br/>\nmake changes confidently. They /save/ you time & effort. Without tests, <br/>\nhow do you know that a change you made didn&#39;t break something?<br/>\n<br/>\nIf a simple change to code results in a tedious change to tests, then <br/>\nyou have a design problem that needs to be addressed. It&#39;s tough to be <br/>\nmore specific without discussing a specific case. In that case, call in <br/>\nan expert.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Has anyone applied junit on a large scale such as this? I&#39;d love to hear<br/>\n&gt; comments about pros & cons and lessons learned etc.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Bottom line: do you want it to work or not? If you want it to work, you <br/>\nhave to test it. If you can find a better way than JUnit, then do it. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes it just requires a lot of work. Big systems require big work <br/>\n-- that makes sense to me. The tricky part is distinguishing these two <br/>\nsituations:<br/>\n<br/>\n1. It takes big work because it&#39;s big.<br/>\n2. It takes big work because the design sucks in a specific way.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow do you learn to distinguish them? With experience.<br/>\n<br/>\nStart slowly, and when you get into trouble, call in the experts. <br/>\nInformally you can use the mailing list, and if your company needs a <br/>\nlarger level of support, then let me know and we can explore more <br/>\ncost-effective means of providing better support.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck!<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJ.
