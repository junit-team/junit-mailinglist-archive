    "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1562696360\"><blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">&gt; hehehehe....sorry you&#39;re sounding like Ron, not sure I<br/>\n&gt; can help there ;)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You could shoot me.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Thinking about it more, I guess I&#39;d have to agree with<br/>\n&gt; the thinking that the people working with you *should*<br/>\n&gt; know better and do the right thing.  If they don&#39;t,<br/>\n&gt; you replace them.  Unfortunately, this isn&#39;t always<br/>\n&gt; the case (at least where I&#39;ve been) so I&#39;ve had to<br/>\n&gt; develop some defensive coding technique.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Exactly; and so the question has to be asked: why the hell not?! Removing <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t necessarily mean firing; it can mean reassigning to another <br/>\ndepartment, changing role, and so on. I firmly believe that any seemingly <br/>\nentirely incompetent person is really just someone in the wrong role. This <br/>\nnotion is reinforced at least once per project.<br/>\n<br/>\nI need to find projects with fewer idiots. :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Also, from your remark about having to change code<br/>\n&gt; because of the checked versus unchecked exceptions, it<br/>\n&gt; sounded like you were merely moaning about some part<br/>\n&gt; of your body hurting.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>&quot;Doctor, it hurts when I declare which exceptions I&#39;m going to throw...&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nUsing unchecked exceptions appears to pass the &quot;doctor, it hurts...&quot; test!<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I, for one, don&#39;t mind having<br/>\n&gt; to go through and change a bunch of code because of<br/>\n&gt; some refactoring I&#39;m doing.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t consider the exception list &quot;code&quot;. Maybe that&#39;s the reason we don&#39;t <br/>\nquite agree on this one. I see it as part of the contract, and I&#39;m not <br/>\naccustomed to explicitly state contracts. To me, that&#39;s what the tests are <br/>\nfor. If I were a heavy-duty Design by Contract guy, I might think differently.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf *all I&#39;m changing* are method signatures, that&#39;s crappy. Period.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Really, on the whole, I would tend to agree with you. <br/>\n&gt; I mainly wanted to get that viewpoint out there to get<br/>\n&gt; the discussion a little broader, just in case anyone<br/>\n&gt; was thinking that the unchecked exceptions were the<br/>\n&gt; end all, be all of coding (in Java anyway).<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>If they follow the Wiki link, they should get ample helpings of both sides of <br/>\nthe issue. :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Fear (of my crappy code and/or design) makes me write<br/>\n&gt; tests.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Me, too.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Fear (of my coworkers or even sometimes of myself)<br/>\n&gt; makes me tend to use checked versus unchecked<br/>\n&gt; exceptions.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Fear of wasting my time makes me tend to use unchecked versus checked <br/>\nexceptions. :)<br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Mindkiller?  Sure...but as long as the fear is<br/>\n&gt; controlled, and you use the response productively, it<br/>\n&gt; can be a good thing. ;)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Fear is good, but only in moderation.<br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; P.S. Ah, something else I just thought of after<br/>\n&gt; re-reading.  We are also using exceptions for flow<br/>\n&gt; control on occasion (for the web-based app we&#39;re<br/>\n&gt; converting from VB).  In those instances, the<br/>\n&gt; exception is thrown and we absolutely must notify the<br/>\n&gt; user and/or do something about it to recover.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I can see where a compile test for that situation would seem better than a <br/>\nruntime test, but I think I prefer the runtime tests, all things being equal.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJ.
