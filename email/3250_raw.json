Mostly they were\nprovided as a test of the installation environment and helped troubleshoot\nconfiguration problems. I have never received an off-the-shelf package\nthat came with unit-tests, but it would make my job easier.\n\nOn Tue, 13 Nov 2001, Rogers, Jason wrote:\n\n&gt; perhaps... but I some how think it is overrated.  These are all\n&gt; assumptions (good ones, most likely).  Has anyone had real-world\n&gt; experience with this?  I am not trying to be a skeptic just for\n&gt; skepticism&#39;s sake.

By looking at their test code and\n&gt; comparing it to your code (which maybe isn&#39;t working), you can get an\n&gt; idea\n&gt; where you or the vendor are making unwarranted assumptions.\n&gt;\n&gt; On Mon, 12 Nov 2001, David Stagner wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Rogers, Jason&quot; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;David Stagner&quot; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; Unit tests document API usage very well, for starters.  And they\n&gt; &gt; &gt; suggest\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; where any bugs encountered might be, even by their absence (a\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; problematic condition may not be tested, and a set of tests\n&gt; could\n&gt; &gt; &gt; rule\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; out a bunch of possible causes for a bug).\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; This seems like a pretty weak argument to me.  They only document\n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; set of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the API that the authors chose to test, and they only test to the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; authors&#39;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; degrees of comfortability.  Truth be known, just because JUnit is in\n&gt; use\n&gt; &gt; &gt; does\n&gt; &gt; &gt; not mean that the code is being tested thoroughly.  Right?  You may\n&gt; be\n&gt; &gt; &gt; right\n&gt; &gt; &gt; that it could show you what isn&#39;t tested, but not necessarily why.\n&gt; And\n&gt; &gt; &gt; it only\n&gt; &gt; &gt; gives you a clue as to what is not tested and what is.  There may\n&gt; not be\n&gt; &gt; &gt; a one\n&gt; &gt; &gt; to one mapping of the public API to the tests.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Granted.  I was assuming that the set of unit tests theoretically\n&gt; &gt; provided by our imaginary vendor (has anyone ever seen a non-open\n&gt; source\n&gt; &gt; vendor do this?) would be reasonably thorough, complete, and\n&gt; &gt; representative.  If the unit tests don&#39;t exercise all the documented\n&gt; &gt; methods and boundaries of the API, they&#39;re incomplete anyway.  The\n&gt; hard\n&gt; &gt; part comes with testing coupling, interaction, and state changes\n&gt; between\n&gt; &gt; components, where the non-trivial bugs often lurk.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; On a more philosophical level, i&#39;d suggest that most unit testing is\n&gt; &gt; either very useful, or mostly useless, depending on the confidence of\n&gt; &gt; the programmer in the testing process.  Cowardly testing is a sign of\n&gt; a\n&gt; &gt; lack of confidence in the code.  Once a programmer gets in the habit\n&gt; of\n&gt; &gt; serious unit testing, the programmer will almost always be more\n&gt; &gt; confident in the code - and thus more likely to test thoroughly.  Good\n&gt; &gt; unit testing is a self-reinforcing feedback loop.  And if i were given\n&gt; a\n&gt; &gt; set of unit tests from a vendor that clearly did not thoroughly test\n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; public interface of the software, i would immediately distrust the\n&gt; &gt; software in question.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n-- \nEric Vought\nChief Technical Officer - QLUE Consulting, Inc.\n\nevought@... toll-free: 888-771-3538  RTP area: 919-816-9901\n\n\n",
