I did need it\n&gt; to be static and didn&#39;t intially conceive that JUnit invokes all the\n&gt; testXXX methods in quick succession (In their own threads?), this did\n&gt; cause some &#39;interesting&#39; contention issues within the reused object\n&gt; (resolved with the addition of a small synchronisation block).  The\n&gt; sync issue means some more tests are needed.  Oh joy 8).\n\nI&#39;m glad you found a solution, but just as a note, the tests run in \nsingle-threaded mode, so it might just be that they&#39;re running quickly. \nThis can be a problem if, for example, one test is deleting from the \nfile system and the next test wants to create the same file. In this \ncase, you usually need to tell your tests to sleep a little. :)\n\nTake care.\n-- \nJ. B.
