(Or disabling the network card if you don&#39;t want to leave your\n&gt; keyboard...)\n&gt;\n&gt; But how do I make sure that no tests depend on anything else outside\n&gt; the JVM? I am looking for a simple and full-proof way to disallow file\n&gt; system access, registry access and the like. (No need for fancy\n&gt; programmatic approaches, manual steps are fine.)\n&gt;\n&gt; Any ideas? Thanks.\n&gt;\n&gt; /Martin\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\n\n\n-- \nJan Kroeze\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n",
