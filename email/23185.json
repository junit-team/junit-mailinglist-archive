I hate myself. And it still uses the soon-to-be-obsolete MethodRule interface instead of the new TestRule abstract class.)<br/>\n<br/>\nAt very least, it might give you some ideas of how to do what you&#39;re trying to do.<br/>\n<br/>\nDale<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",
