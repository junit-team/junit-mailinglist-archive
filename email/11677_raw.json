As far \nas I can tell they can be more accurately described as beeing \nfunctionality tests as they usually test one use case end-to-end. That \ncame into beeing, since when I joined the project there were no tests at \nall (aside from a few bit-rotted functionallity tests) and I started \nwriting what I thought at that time to be unit tests.\n\nFor example there are several tests that define a query (defined in OQL \n(similar to SQL, but working on an object level)) that get&#39;s converted to \nSQL, run on the database, the result retrieved, converted to java objects \nand then my test checks wether the objects are exactly the objects that \nwere expected. I think I do have a rather clean idea how this could be \nsplit into unit tests, only the system I&#39;m testing is not modular enough \nto allow this. (And to refactor it I&#39;d need more tests, that I can&#39;t write \n&#39;till it&#39;s refactored ... a classical catch-22).\n\nFortunately there is some heavy refactoring in the future of this project \nthat will allow me to introduce more &quot;real&quot; unit tests ...\n\nThe reason I write all this down is that I&#39;d like to hear wether anyone of \nyou has any experience/good advice for this kind of unit-test-free legacy \nsystem. I&#39;d be interested how you use functionality tests (in addition to \nunit tests?) and wether anyone knows any tools that are better suited for \nthis kind of job than JUnit.\n\nregards\nJoachim Sauer\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\n",
