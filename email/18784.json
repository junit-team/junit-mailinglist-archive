Unit tests. Acceptance tests. Tests<br/>\nup the wazoo.<br/>\nThey&#39;ll be asked to make some trivial change to a sub-system and tests will<br/>\nfail - as well they should.<br/>\nThey will be shocked and surprised by the test failures and will scramble<br/>\naround looking for functional specs and detailed designs.<br/>\nThey will blame all of the ills of the industry on the paucity of<br/>\ndocumentation.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere will be a great backlash to plan-driven, up-front design intensive<br/>\nmethodologies and the cycle of history will start anew.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nKevin<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.junitfactory.com\">http://www.junitfactory.com</a><br/>\nYou send us code.
