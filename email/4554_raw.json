Is anybody\n&gt; &gt;else is doing this and how they are implementing DBC (iContract? JASS? or\n&gt; &gt;merely at a documentation level?)\n&gt;\n&gt;JBR\n&gt;\n&gt;Test-Driven Development drives a programmer towards DBC on a test-by-test\n&gt;basis. As a result, although I don&#39;t use DBC tools, I believe I&#39;m doing DBC\n&gt;\n&gt;by simply writing the tests first. In a way, JUnit is my DBC tool.\n&gt;\n&gt;From: steven.hale@...\n&gt;\n&gt;I can see your point from a component manufacturer&#39;s point of view - I can\n&gt;test that I can fullfil my contract using JUnit.\n&gt;\n&gt;From a component user view point I&#39;d still like to see a concise\n&gt;description of the prerequisites without having to dig into the component\n&gt;code or even the unit testing code...\n&gt;... though I realise I&#39;m in danger of reopening the javadoc v unit test\n&gt;discussion :-)\n\nIndeed. Not only that, as a component user, I find that Javadoc is \nsufficient to my purpose most of the time. It is rare that I need the level \nof detail that a class&#39; contract gives me. When I do need it, I want it in a \nformal notation, since natural languages are ambiguous. At that point, Java \ncode is the preferred formal notation, since Java is the language I program \nin the most. I&#39;ll accept Smalltalk and muddle through with Ruby. Any way you \nslice it, I wanna see code. The best code is self-verifying executing code. \nSounds like a JUnit test. :)\n\nJ. B.
