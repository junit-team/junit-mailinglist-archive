To be specific, let suppose<br/>\n&gt;that there is 3 different teams with team leader in each one and<br/>\n&gt;project manager makes status meeting once a week. If I was a project<br/>\n&gt;manager that is what would I say. But if I was team leader and heard<br/>\n&gt;this from my project manager, than I would think that there is<br/>\n&gt;definitely problem with my managing.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;1) Perhaps, I don&#39;t know what everybody does on daily basis, so I<br/>\n&gt;spend a lot of time to get it out once a week.<br/>\n&gt;2) Perhaps, I involve my team excessively in preparation to the status<br/>\n&gt;meeting and I should just live them along. I should use information<br/>\n&gt;that I receive from them on daily basis.<br/>\n&gt;3) Perhaps, I report just too many details of what&#39;s going on and I<br/>\n&gt;should cut it off.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;So, potentially this highlights some managing problem.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--- In junit@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Kent Beck&quot; &lt;kentb@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; I had no idea the weekly meeting was cost 20% of our capacity.

You<br/>\n&gt;could cut your prep time in half without losing any of the value to me<br/>\n&gt;or, I think, to the team.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;&gt; Cheers,<br/>\n&gt;&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;&gt; Kent Beck<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Three Rivers Institute<br/>\n&gt;&gt; <br/>\n&gt;&gt;   _____  <br/>\n&gt;&gt; <br/>\n&gt;&gt; From: junit@yahoogroups.com [mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com] On Behalf<br/>\n&gt;Of mfeathers@...<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Sent: Tuesday, June 10, 2008 9:40 AM<br/>\n&gt;&gt; To: junit@yahoogroups.com<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Subject: Re: A Note On Data-Gathering (Was Re: [junit] A case for<br/>\n&gt;adding logging of assertions to junit)<br/>\n&gt;&gt; <br/>\n&gt;&gt; <br/>\n&gt;&gt; <br/>\n&gt;&gt; <br/>\n&gt;&gt; I think that metrics are fine when people just treat them as a<br/>\n&gt;source of information. The place where people mess up is when they<br/>\n&gt;reflexively assume that particular numbers indicate problems and that<br/>\n&gt;there is some sort of moral imperative to confront all perceived<br/>\n&gt;problems. The fact is, there is no linkage there other than what we<br/>\n&gt;bring to the table. People and teams have natural rhythms and we have<br/>\n&gt;to take care when we decide what to optimize. <br/>\n&gt;&gt; <br/>\n&gt;&gt; The fact that people are less productive on one particular day out<br/>\n&gt;of the week would not surprise me. If someone told me that a team was<br/>\n&gt;uniformly productive every day of the week, I&#39;d actually be rather<br/>\n&gt;scared of what I might find if I was to visit them.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; <br/>\n&gt;&gt; Michael<br/>\n&gt;&gt; <br/>\n&gt;&gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;From: Mike Hill &lt;mike@industriallogi<br/>\n&gt;&lt;mailto:mike%40industriallogic.com&gt; c.com&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;Sent: Jun 10, 2008 11:39 AM<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;To: junit@yahoogroups. &lt;mailto:junit%40yahoogroups.com&gt; com<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;Subject: A Note On Data-Gathering (Was Re: [junit] A case for<br/>\n&gt;adding logging of assertions to junit)<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;On Tue, Jun 10, 2008 at 10:07 AM, Kent Beck &lt;kentb@earthlink.<br/>\n&gt;&lt;mailto:kentb%40earthlink.net&gt; net&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; This is what DevCreek (www.devcreek.com) does, and the results<br/>\n&gt;are often<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; surprising. For example, we noticed that on Wednesdays the<br/>\n&gt;DevCreek team<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; itself wrote a quarter of the tests it wrote on other days. Turns<br/>\n&gt;out they<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; were spending most of the day preparing for the weekly status<br/>\n&gt;meeting.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;So. Side topic, and favorite horse-floggee of mine: did the metric<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;do anything for us that simply knowing the team well wouldn&#39;t have<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;already done? I&#39;m assuming, here, dangerous habit, that there was no<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;team-perceived process-weakness on Wednesdays prior to the metric. If<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;that&#39;s a valid assumption, dangerous habit admitted, then this would<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;seem to be a case where a metric -- not free -- gave us a false<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;positive -- not free -- requiring at least a little bit of<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;investigation to determine root cause -- not free. Metrics are<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;scarily complex to me, and I wish my world had either fewer of them,<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;or fewer people relying on them.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Teams<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; using DevCreek don&#39;t seem to change their behavior much on the<br/>\n&gt;basis of the<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; feedback, though, which I find surprising. Perhaps the feedback<br/>\n&gt;isn&#39;t really<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; all that useful, perhaps we don&#39;t have the right presentation of the<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; information, or perhaps people just need to get used to the idea<br/>\n&gt;that the<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; information is there for them.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;Or, another favorite equine victim of mine, perhaps people are<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;decidedly less rational than we routinely realize.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;Of course, once having typed this in, I immediately jump to another<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;way of seeing it: put scare quotes around &#39;rational&#39;. To make this<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;second idea more clear, I&#39;ll say I might have theorized that the team<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;would respond (incorrectly) by &#39;rationally&#39; honoring feedback that<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;didn&#39;t meet its -- what words to use here? -- gestalt self-image. In<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;fact, the team responded (correctly) by &#39;irrationally&#39; ignoring<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;feedback that didn&#39;t meet that gestalt self-image.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;A third way in to the puzzle: information is not useful until it is<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;integrated into a framework of meaning. At any given time, any such<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;framework has a loose boundary (the so-called hermeneutic horizon),<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;which represents the only possible locations where new information can<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;be fit. If the boundary is not situated where the new information can<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;be fit in, it will be ignored, hence useless. So it pays to focus<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;one&#39;s attention not just on generating data, but on generating the<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;data that will fit the current boundary for the current group and<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;enable that group to become what it wants.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;This is why I am so negative about quests for ever-more-detailed<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;metrics, or one-size-fits-all approaches to measuring progress in<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;human enterprise. Down this road lies Taylor, and a reversion of some<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;particularly hard won 20th century knowledge. When someone posts<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;about &quot;what metric is best?&quot;, I wish we could all post back &quot;the one<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;that helps your team&quot;.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;I&#39;m reminded of a magnificent insight granted to me by Jerome Bruner,<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;who somewhere remarks that the purpose of therapy is not to reveal the<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;truth, but to construct a story which enables the patient to move<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;towards his or her goal.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;Cheers,<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;Hill<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;Wanna learn XP skills the hard way?
