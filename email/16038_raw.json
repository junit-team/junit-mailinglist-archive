However, for=\r\n commercial software development, is this\nstill possible ?\n\n\nAlthough I kne=\r\nw JUnit and other JUnit-based open-source tools for a\ncouple of years, my c=\r\nompany and team never really enbrace it. The\nmajor reason is Product Manage=\r\nrs always want to add cool features to\nthe system quickly while programmers=\r\n find the schedule is always too\ntight to spend any extra time to write tes=\r\nting. \n\nI know from the mail list and books that we can take lots of advant=\r\nage\nof JUnit-based testing, I myself have no real hands-on experience on\nit=\r\n. So here are my questions: \n\n* Will Junit-based testing make the project t=\r\nime longer or shorter ?\nAny hard statistic data ? ( Here I mean commercial =\r\nproject rather than\nopen-source project. )\n\n* One intersting point I found =\r\nis that after Junit-based testing is\nintroduced, programmers tend to use ID=\r\nE debugger much less than\nbefore.  This would save lots of time. Is that tr=\r\nue ?\n\n* Some guys say JUnit is good for biz / util code testing. But for we=\r\nb\napplication development, where HTML/javascript would be root cause of\nlot=\r\ns of bugs, Junit is not so powerful. Any comments ? \n\n* How can I convince =\r\nmanagers and programmers that JUnit-based is\nreally possible for commercial=\r\n software development ? Any differnece\nfrom open-source projects ?\n\n\n \nCan =\r\nsome Junit gurus shed some light here ?\n\nThanks, \n- Frank\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
