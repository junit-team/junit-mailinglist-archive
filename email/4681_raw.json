It shows my classes being loaded by the VM&#39;s class loader.  From wh=\r\nat I understand, JUnit uses it&#39;s own class loader in certain situations.  I=\r\n&#39;m wondering if it&#39;s a problem with JUnit&#39;s class loader.  \n\nI&#39;m running my=\r\n tests by creating a main method in my test class which creates a \nTestSuit=\r\ne object and calls the run method on the suite.  In other words, I&#39;m not us=\r\ning the TextRunner to run my tests.  I had the same problems with the TextR=\r\nunner.\n\nI&#39;m also hardcoding the servialVersionUID in my classes.  The way t=\r\nhe serialVersionUID is calculated is by creating a hashcode based on the de=\r\nfinition of the class.  I&#39;m making an educated guess here that it&#39;s somehow=\r\n getting an empty class definition which yields an ID of 0.  (As I said bef=\r\nore, I&#39;m hard coding the ID so that also leads me to believe that somehow t=\r\nhe class def is not being loaded properly).\n\nVery strange.  \n\n-----Original=\r\n Message-----\nFrom: smangal [mailto:smangal@...]\nSent: Saturday, Apr=\r\nil 13, 2002 01:20\nTo: junit@yahoogroups.com\nSubject: RE: [junit] Problems t=\r\nesting an app that uses java\nserialization\n\n\nCheck ur classpath, Its possib=\r\nle when you run them from cmd line, classpath\n(may be old one) still has ol=\r\nd version of your classes.

My app is distributed=\r\n and uses\nserialization to send java objects over the wire.  When I run my =\r\ntests from\nwithin Forte they work fine.  When I run them from the command l=\r\nine I get a\nInvalidClassException stating the serialVersionUID of my class =\r\nis 0, which\ndoesn&#39;t match the receiving version ID of the class.  The id of=\r\n 0 makes me\nthink that for some reason my serialized classes aren&#39;t being l=\r\noaded\nproperly.  For one thing I&#39;m defining the serialVersionUID myself and=\r\n it&#39;s\nnot 0.\n\n  My application seems to work perfectly except for the class=\r\n version\nproblem so the classes are being loaded at least by the VM&#39;s defau=\r\nlt class\nloader (and it works from within forte!?).\n\n  Has anyone ever seen=\r\n this behaviour?\n\n  Any ideas would be greatly appreciated.\n\n  Thanks,\n  Ri=\r\nch\n\n\n\n  -------------------------------------------------------------------=\r\n-\n  Rich Bolen\n  Senior Software Developer\n  GretagMacbeth Advanced Technol=\r\nogies Center\n  79 T.
