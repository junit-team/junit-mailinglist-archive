We should start keeping score :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nBTW, I can definitely recommend two of the books. I wasn&#39;t aware &quot;Next<br/>\nGeneration Java Testing&quot; of before now, but I&#39;ll definitely have to take a<br/>\nlook. Anything co-authored by Cédric and the Bileblogger should contain<br/>\nsome good gems.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers,<br/>\nJoe<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Mon, 22 October, 2007 5:22 pm, ovisual12 wrote:<br/>\n&gt; My name is Vince and I am looking for a reliable solution to testing<br/>\n&gt; EJB&#39;s.

Can anyone give me some suggestions and point me<br/>\n&gt; in the right direction.  Any help would be greatly appreciate, a tutorial<br/>\n&gt; anything that will help get me started.  I would preferable like a<br/>\n&gt; solution that can fit into a night build and test enviornment.  We use<br/>\n&gt; Continuum to build and test our companies code everynight.  If I could<br/>\n&gt; drive the EJB test cases from a Maven pom that would be a bonus.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thanks in advance,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Vince </span></blockquote></div>",
