The problem is: if one fails, the other two will run <br/>\n&gt;anyway. But if the creation or getter methods fail, it doesn`t make <br/>\n&gt;sense for me to test the deletion method, as it depends on the <br/>\n&gt;correctness of the other two. I know calling one test inside another <br/>\n&gt;is not recommended. What should I do in this case? <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>There are a few options, depending on the kind of tests you&#39;re running.<br/>\n<br/>\n1. Change your tests so that they can run independently. This is the best overall approach.<br/>\n<br/>\n2. Make your test fixture &quot;self-repairing&quot;. Add logic to your test fixture so that it puts itself into the expected state even when a test fails. If you can do this, then you can probably do #1.<br/>\n<br/>\n3. Place your tests into one, single test. You lose the ability to report on each test separately, but then I would argue that you really have one large test and not three smaller tests.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne question to ask: what are you trying to test? If you are testing business logic that, as a side-effect, calls these methods you mention, then separate data access from business logic. If you are testing your integration with a database, then you may be testing the database driver and not your code!<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope this helps.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nJ. B.
