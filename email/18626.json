I&#39;m sure you can<br/>\neasily find similar code in your own applications (two ifs, two booleans in<br/>\neach if and a try/catch).<br/>\n<br/>\nEach branch multiplies the number of code paths by two, and that&#39;s not even<br/>\ntaking exceptions into account, which add multipliers of their own.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe bottom line is that in average, I would expect that a typical Java<br/>\nmethod probably requires 10-20 test cases to be 100% branch covered, hence<br/>\nmy belief that trying to achieve this number is not just a bad idea, it&#39;s<br/>\nunprofessional :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nCédric<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://testng.org\">http://testng.org</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On 1/3/07, Mike Bria &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:bria526xp@...\">bria526xp@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; On 1/3/07, Cédric Beust ♔ &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:cbeust@...\">cbeust@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; {snip}<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  Consider the following simple code:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  public URL createUrl(int a, int b) {<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  try {<br/>\n&gt; &gt;    if (a == 0 || b == 0) {<br/>\n&gt; &gt;    }<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  if (c == 0 && d == 0) {<br/>\n&gt; &gt;    }<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  }<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  catch(IOException ex) {<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  }<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  catch(MalformedURLException ex) {<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  }<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Do you really feel it&#39;s useful to write 16 test cases for these 6<br/>\n&gt; lines of code?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Cedric --<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I don&#39;t quite understand your example.  Why would that code ever be<br/>\n&gt; written?  It doesn&#39;t do anything at all (at least as written).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I assume there is implied code that has been omitted to save<br/>\n&gt; keystrokes and eye movement?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; If in that case I were to be imaginative and dream up some [also<br/>\n&gt; simple] additional code that would, at the least, birth c, d, and/or a<br/>\n&gt; URL or give rise to the possibility of the two stated exceptions, then<br/>\n&gt; yes, to me this method appears to have enough margin for error that I<br/>\n&gt; would want it protected with unit tests.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Did I miss your point?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Cheers...<br/>\n&gt; --MB<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Yahoo!
