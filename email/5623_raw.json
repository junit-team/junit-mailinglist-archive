(LNG-MBC) wrote:\n\n&gt;\tI was thinking more along the lines of a weekly build type of\n&gt;process, where everyone puts their updated code into a central location and\n&gt;the buildmaster compiles and tests everything. I can easily envision a case\n&gt;where someone either forgets to test their code or checks in the wrong code.\n&gt;If a suite of tests was represented within a single test, you would get a\n&gt;single confusing error rather than a flurry of errors which might give you a\n&gt;better idea of what&#39;s going on. \n&gt;\n&gt;\tYes, it would be nice if we were all in an agile/extreme world where\n&gt;everyone was testing their code multiple times a day and builds were a daily\n&gt;occurrence, but some of us are in traditional with the &quot;fragile&quot; way of\n&gt;doing things and are doing the best we can ;-)\n&gt;\n\nKeep doing the best you can.  :-)  \n\nIn my experience, if you attempt to mask a problem it will never get \nresolved.  I&#39;d be inclined to let all the tests fail once the first one \ntrips up.  Then I get an opportunity to feel the pain.  In response, I \nhave to make a decision about whether building more often would be more \nor less painful.  Without that feedback, I find it&#39;s difficult for me to \nimprove the process because I miss opportunities for minor course \ncorrections.\n\nMike\n\n-- \nMike Clark\nClarkware Consulting Inc.\nhttp://www.clarkware.com \n(720) 851-2014\n\n\n\n\n",
