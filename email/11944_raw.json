This is a classic source of error in software, and \nI would hate to see you present it to students as a good idea.\n\nAlso, in your example, the price can be wrong by up to 1% in either \ndirection! Is this really what you want? If the price comes back as \n7.93, that&#39;s good enough?! No way.\n\nAt least for now, use an integer to express price in cents, so you would \nhave this:\n\npublic void testPrice()\n{\n       Book book = new Book();\n       book.setPrice(799);\n       assertEquals(799, book.getPrice());\n}\n\nThere&#39;s also no reason to call the variable &quot;b1&quot;. If it&#39;s a book, then \ncall it a book.\n\n&gt; Sudents should write the set and get methods and set values\n&gt; correctly so this test is passed.\n&gt; \n&gt; Problem : - I want them to work through the exercises and tests one\n&gt; at a time, but the test class will obviously not compile until all\n&gt; of the correct methods are in place in the Book class.\n\nWhy is this a problem? That&#39;s part of test-driven development: you write \na test, then write enough code to make it /compile/, then run the test \nand watch it fail, then write enough code to make the test pass. That&#39;s \n&quot;textbook&quot; test-driven development, and exactly the way I teach it.\n\n&gt; Is my approach to this incorrect. Is there better way?\n\nWell, your code needed some work, but your approach is solid.\n\n&gt; Hope you can help.\n\nYou be the judge. :)\n-- \nJ. B.
