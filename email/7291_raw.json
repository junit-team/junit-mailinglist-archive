Running each test method in its own\n&gt;&gt; instance shields you from any problem.\n&gt;\n&gt; e.g. static class members are not safely initialized if you share \n&gt; instances.\n&gt;\nI&#39;m not sure what you mean. Perhaps you could clarify? The static \nvariables will be initialized once when the class is first &quot;actively&quot; \nused, not when each instance is created. If you&#39;re using JUnit&#39;s Swing \nrunner and reloading classes each time, the static members will be \ninitialized once per run.\n\nhttp://www.artima.com/insidejvm/ed2/lifetype.html\n\nOn the other hand, your comment made me realize that perhaps test \nmethods in a TestCase could share a fixture by storing that fixture in \nstatic variables. If the fixture includes an expensive database \nconnection, for example, could that connection not be created by the \nfirst test method and stored in a static variable for all subsequent \ntest methods to share? Not sure how you could close the connection at \nthe end of the last test method executed, though. Has anyone used \nstatic variables to share fixture objects among multiple test methods?\n\nbv\n--\nBill Venners\nArtima Software, Inc.\nhttp://www.artima.com\n\n\n\n",
