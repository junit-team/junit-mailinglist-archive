    "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-181049674\">Hey all,<br/>\n<br/>\nI am building a plugin engine (www.platonos.org) where<br/>\nI would like to provide some unit tests to test the<br/>\nability of the engine handling threaded plugin<br/>\ncreation requests. In a nutshell, when a plugin, which<br/>\nis loaded by its own classloader, is being<br/>\ninstantiated, it is possible another thread from<br/>\nanother plugin that depends on it is ALSO trying to<br/>\naccess it. The very first time any class within the<br/>\nclasspath of a plugin is asked for by the JVM, the<br/>\nplugin lifecycle class is created first.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I want a way to try to simulate several threads<br/>\naccessing the same one plugin, and some way to &quot;test&quot;<br/>\nthat the first thread to access it &quot;locks&quot; the plugin<br/>\nduring creation and the other threads wait (we have<br/>\nsynchronized the block of code that creates the<br/>\nplugin) until the creation is done. THEN, they should<br/>\nnot be able to cause the plugin they are acessing to<br/>\nbe created again, because it&#39;s state now indicates its<br/>\nalready created.<br/>\n<br/>\nWithout diving any further into the engine, feel free<br/>\nto check out the source. Is there any way to test<br/>\nthis? I am thinking in the constructor of the plugin<br/>\nbeing accessed by many threads, put a sleep call to<br/>\n&quot;delay&quot; how fast the plugin is created, so that the<br/>\nother threads have time to try to access it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n__________________________________ <br/>\nDo you Yahoo!? <br/>\nYahoo!
