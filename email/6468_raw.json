[mailto:mamago@...]\n  Sent: vrijdag 13 december 2002 16:53\n  To: junit@yahoogroups.com\n  Subject: [junit] OT: OO Newcomer\n\n\n  OFF TOPIC\n  Disclaimer:  see below\n\n  Bringing a newbie into OO\n  =========================\n\n  I would like to ask the people on this list for recommendations of the\nbest\n  literature to bring an OO newbie up to speed.\n\n  The programming language in question is Java, which means that there is a\n  splendid wealth of online material for someone to learn the language.  The\n  important thing, however, is to instill the notion of OO purity, which is\n  harder, perhaps, than just teaching the language.\n\n  For example: the GoF patterns book is a must, but I think it is not a text\n  that you can give to someone until they have a grounding in OO techniques.\n\n  Your thoughts?\n\n  Manuel Amago.\n\n  -----------------------------------------------\n  DISCLAIMER\n  I know this group is not for this type of question, which is why I\n  explicitly labelled this thread as OT (Off Topic).  I hope you will\nforgive\n  my impertinence.  ;)\n  But, I greatly value the opinions of the people on this list, and I trust\n  your opinion on this particular issue.\n\n  --------------------------------------------------------------------\n  mail2web - Check your email from the web at\n  http://mail2web.com/ .\n\n\n\n  To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n  junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n\n\n  Your use of Yahoo!
