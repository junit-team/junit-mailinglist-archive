We may find ourselves performing <br/>\n&gt; checks at the edge of a system, say at the client interfaces, but I <br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t find much value in precondition checking inside application code.  <br/>\n&gt; I prefer to write my code so that usage is obvious and documented with <br/>\n&gt; test cases.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>The boundary I would pick is the public API. If a method is public (or <br/>\nprotected) then there&#39;s really nothing you can do about who calls it and <br/>\nnothing you can assume about what they will pass beyond the types of the <br/>\narguments. Internal classes not meant for public consumption need not <br/>\nrigorously verify each precondition if substantial testing demonstrates <br/>\ntheir correctness *provided* that they are not public. If they are <br/>\npublic, all bets are off.<br/>\n<br/>\nFar too much code in Java is made public without adequate foresight. <br/>\nAgain this is partially a defect of the language since packages are <br/>\neffectively private to each other. Following this principle usually <br/>\nmeans you restrict yourself to a single package. It would be nice if <br/>\nJava had a little more flexibility here, and we may indeed get that in <br/>\nJava 7. Until then, though, non-verified classes should be non-public <br/>\nand usually all in a single package.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n﻿Elliotte Rusty Harold  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:elharo@...\">elharo@...</a><br/>\nJava I/O 2nd Edition Just Published!<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.cafeaulait.org/books/javaio2/\">http://www.cafeaulait.org/books/javaio2/</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0596527500/ref=nosim/cafeaulaitA/\">http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0596527500/ref=nosim/cafeaulaitA/</a></div>",
