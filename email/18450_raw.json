I&#39;ve found TDD to be a good teaching \ntool in itself. The book introduces OO design concepts throughout (not \nin a heavy-handed fashion, however), my attempt to make a more seamless \nlearning experience.\n\nMost programmers learn Java separately from OO concepts. Most Java \nbooks, sadly, teach it largely from a syntactical standpoint. Few books \ndo a good job of both. Same with TDD--new programmers learn Java&#39;s \nsyntax of, then come back and have to rethink how to construct their \ncode. Seems wasteful to me. I see the pain constantly from old dogs \n(like myself)--it&#39;s a real struggle to change your approach to \ndeveloping software after so many years of ingraining code construction \ntechniques.\n\nAgile Java still uses JUnit 3.8 (it was written mostly in 2004, and \nfirst appeared in Feb 2005), but (a) JUnit 4 is a reasonably easy \ntransition, (b) most programmers will need and want to know both for a \nwhile yet, and (c) the tool ain&#39;t the thing--I&#39;d also like to think that \nsomeone could quickly adapt the code in the book to TestNG. Agile Java \nhasn&#39;t sold gobs of copies, although it got some very good reviews. I \nthink that&#39;s because it was at least a year ahead of Java 5 starting to \ntake off, which it seems to have finally been starting to do this year.\n\nOne thing I&#39;m pretty proud of is how the book is crafted to introduce as \nfew &quot;forward references&quot; as possible, and how it emphasizes OO \ndevelopment over procedural. I don&#39;t talk about arrays ([]) until pretty \nfar into the book.\n\nJB, your best strategy is to probably buy a few thousand copies. That \nway no one will know if you ended up rewriting it.\n\nI think there&#39;s a market for an &quot;agile ruby...&quot;\n\nJeff\n\n-- \nLangr Software Solutions\nhttp://langrsoft.com\nAgile Java: Crafting Code With Test-Driven Development\n\n\n\nJ.

Agile Java &lt;http://www.bookpool.com/sm/0131482394 \n&gt;&gt; &lt;http://www.bookpool.com/sm/0131482394&gt;&gt; by Jeff\n&gt;&gt; Langr?\n&gt;&gt;     \n&gt; I wondered how much overlap there would be between my book and his. I \n&gt; haven&#39;t read Jeff&#39;s from beginning to end. I think we probably have \n&gt; similar content in spots, but slightly different goals. Part of me wants \n&gt; to read it to make sure I&#39;m not rewriting it; part of me wants to avoid \n&gt; it so that I don&#39;t subconsciously rewrite it. I don&#39;t know how to deal \n&gt; with it.\n&gt;\n&gt; Jeff, maybe we should talk about my idea and you can tell me whether I&#39;d \n&gt; be rewriting your book. I feel no need to do that.\n&gt;\n&gt; In the worst case, I would write mine in another language, which I was \n&gt; probably going to have to do, anyway.\n&gt;   \n\n\n",
