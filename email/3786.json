The last project I was on applied many of the XP <br/>\npractices (test first,<br/>\nunit testing).<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen designing our classes, we would write tests (contracts) <br/>\nverifiying the functionality<br/>\nof our classes.  If one practices this approach when developing, what <br/>\nadditional benefit <br/>\ndo assertions bring to the table?<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is the example I have been using:<br/>\n<br/>\nSay we have a Math class with a sqrt routine.  We want to make it <br/>\nclear to the outside<br/>\nworld that our routine does not handle negative numbers.  If I were <br/>\nto write this class<br/>\ntoday using standard Java mechanisms for argument checking, the <br/>\nmethod would look <br/>\nsomething like this:<br/>\n<br/>\npublic float sqrt(float number) {<br/>\n\tif (number &lt; 0) {<br/>\n\t   throw IllegalArgumentException(&quot;Number can not be <br/>\nnegative.&quot;);<br/>\n\t}<br/>\n}<br/>\n<br/>\nIf we were to make this a precondition (ala Design By Contract) the <br/>\nassertion would look<br/>\nsomething like:<br/>\n<br/>\npublic float sqrt(float number) {<br/>\n\tassert number &lt; 0 : &quot;Number can not be negative.&quot;;<br/>\n}<br/>\n<br/>\nWhats the difference?  Is one better then the other?<br/>\n<br/>\nHow is the &#39;assert&#39; keyword affecting the code people are writing?<br/>\n<br/>\nJonathan</div>",
