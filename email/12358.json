Long story short, the GUI harness helps in building<br/>\n&gt; test suites. Part of this harness is allowing the user to add new<br/>\n&gt; testcases in a graphical tree, define the class name, and the methods<br/>\n&gt; of the class. All of this is embeddable within existing applications,<br/>\n&gt; such as a Swing GUI app to allow a developer to quickly assemble and<br/>\n&gt; execute individual tests without having to drop to the command line.<br/>\n&gt; All of this works presently. My one BIG problem is trying to get the<br/>\n&gt; test results from the test cases that are ran, so that I can embed<br/>\n&gt; something similar to the &lt;junitreport&gt; task that ant has. After a<br/>\n&gt; single test, or a group of tests run, I want my harness to show the<br/>\n&gt; output.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; My initial thought was that I did not have to execute a junit TestCase<br/>\n&gt; through the junit run(TestResult) method. Basically, I was hoping I<br/>\n&gt; could somehow get the assertXxx() output directly. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Essentially you are looking at writing your own test runner. You can<br/>\nlook at numerous examples of this - look at how ant implements the<br/>\njunit task, look at the open source project JUnitEE or the<br/>\nJUnitServlet included with HttpUnit - all are examples of custom test<br/>\nrunners which can produce their results as xml.</div>",
