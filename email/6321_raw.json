(Axis does web \nservices, i.e. SOAP.) One of the archives Axis code needs is \ncommons-logging.jar, which has classes in the package \norg.apache.commons.logging and subpackages.\n\nMy client class&#39; constructor calls the default constructor for an Axis \nclass, org.apache.axis.client.Service. This causes an exception to crop up:\njava.lang.ExceptionInInitializerError\nat org.apache.axis.client.Service.&lt;init&gt;(Service.java:108)\n...\nCaused by: org.apache.commons.logging.LogConfigurationException: ... \norg.apache.commons.logging.impl.Jdk14Logger does not implement Log\nat \norg.apache.commons.logging.impl.LogFactoryImpl.newInstance(LogFactoryImpl.java:555) \n\n...\n\nNow, Jdk14Logger does implement Log; both are in commons-logging.jar. At \nfirst, I thought this was a simple classloading issue, that somehow an \ninconsistent version of the class or interface was being picked up. But \nafter moving common-logging.jar to the head of my classpath list for \ninvoking JUnit, I still got the error. And anyway, I don&#39;t see Jdk14Logger \nor Log elsewhere in the classpath.\n\nThen I suspected this issue had something to do with JUnit because I saw \n&quot;Jdk14Logger does not implement Log&quot; had made its way to the Cactus mailing \nlist. Sure enough, when I run my Axis client directly rather than through \nJUnit, the exception does not appear.\n\nThe funny (weird) thing is, the only difference between the classpath for \nrunning the client directly and the classpath for running the client \nthrough my TestCase subclass is the addition of junit.jar. And that doesn&#39;t \nhave any classes related to commons-logging.\n\n\n\n",
