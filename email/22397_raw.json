Under this approach I \n&gt; definitely want the test marked ignored if the assumptions failed.\n&gt; \n&gt; What I really don&#39;t like is how do you know when an \n&gt; assumption fails the way the theory is implemented now?

A test that never executes because its assumption is \n&gt; &gt; never satisfied is counterproductive.  In this case, a \n&gt; failure would \n&gt; &gt; alert the user could fix the assumption, update the test data, or \n&gt; &gt; remove the test entirely if it&#39;s no longer needed.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Rocco\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; From: junit@yahoogroups.com [mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com] On \n&gt; &gt; Behalf Of Charlie Poole\n&gt; &gt; Sent: Thursday, February 11, 2010 2:28 AM\n&gt; &gt; To: junit@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; &gt; Subject: RE: [junit] Something is bothering me about assumptions\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; It seems to me that the behavior you are asking for is \n&gt; &gt; appropriate if an assumption fails in a normal test as \n&gt; &gt; opposed to a theory.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Charlie\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; &gt; &gt; From: junit@yahoogroups.com&lt;mailto:junit%40yahoogroups.com&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; [mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com&lt;mailto:junit%40yahoogroups.com&gt;] On \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Behalf Of Berin\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Sent: Tuesday, February 09, 2010 2:29 PM\n&gt; &gt; &gt; To: junit@yahoogroups.com&lt;mailto:junit%40yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Subject: [junit] Something is bothering me about assumptions\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I&#39;ve seen in a few places that if an assumption fails, the test \n&gt; &gt; &gt; automatically passes. I then ran into the test case that \n&gt; &gt; confirms that \n&gt; &gt; &gt; action. Coming from the aspect that I want to have \n&gt; &gt; confidence that my \n&gt; &gt; &gt; code and tests are functioning properly, I honestly think \n&gt; &gt; that is the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; wrong action.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; If an assumption is violated then it should be either a \n&gt; &gt; failure or at \n&gt; &gt; &gt; best ignored. To say the test passes because something \n&gt; &gt; failed is like \n&gt; &gt; &gt; saying you don&#39;t have a cavity because the dentist \n&gt; doesn&#39;t have the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; right tool. You don&#39;t know one way or the other, and the \n&gt; &gt; test won&#39;t be \n&gt; &gt; &gt; able to run properly when the assumption is violated.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; It&#39;s partly that reason that I don&#39;t use assumptions to \n&gt; &gt; begin with. If \n&gt; &gt; &gt; there needs to be a certain precondition to the test \n&gt; &gt; passing, I will \n&gt; &gt; &gt; add those assertions before I perform the action that needs to be \n&gt; &gt; &gt; tested. To me, it is a failure if the test could not be set up \n&gt; &gt; &gt; properly.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; If you want something a little softer, then I recommend \n&gt; &gt; that a failed \n&gt; &gt; &gt; assumption is equivalent to the @Ignore annotation.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; You&#39;ll see in the summary that X number of tests were run, \n&gt; &gt; Y number of \n&gt; &gt; &gt; tests ignored, and Z number of tests failed.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Although, for ignored tests I&#39;d like to see what the reason was \n&gt; &gt; &gt; (failed assumption or manually ignored through the attribute).\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Making a test pass because of a failed assumption gives \n&gt; you a false \n&gt; &gt; &gt; sense of security about your code. What is happening is \n&gt; &gt; that the test \n&gt; &gt; &gt; just wasn&#39;t run, and there may be a legitimate problem \n&gt; &gt; hiding. To me \n&gt; &gt; &gt; that is the most dangerous part of that solution. I&#39;d \n&gt; &gt; rather get the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; bad news straight than trust faulty information.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Am I making sense?\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Yahoo!
