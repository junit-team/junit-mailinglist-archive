Excess complexity<br/>\n&gt;  &gt;<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; They make receiving a message more complex, it&#39;s true. They make<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; sending a message much simpler. Or rather, they add more lines of<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; code on the receiving side; but they eliminate dependencies on the<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; sending side. The benefit of those eliminated dependencies is very<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; powerful.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m not sure I believe the second part. In practice, replacing a<br/>\n&gt; concrete-class based solution with an interface-based solution expands<br/>\n&gt; the complexity for the caller. What used to require a single class now<br/>\n&gt; typically requires three: a factory to create the factory, the factory<br/>\n&gt; itself, and the interface you&#39;re actually trying to create. I&#39;m not sure<br/>\n&gt; you really need all that, but you need at least two pieces where you<br/>\n&gt; previously needed one, and in practice three is what we usually seem to<br/>\n&gt; end up with. (Think of DocumentBuilderFactory, DocumentBuilder, and<br/>\n&gt; Document in JAXP/DOM for example). And of course there are still<br/>\n&gt; concrete classes for each of these. We&#39;ve turned what could have been<br/>\n&gt; one concrete class (Document) into six separate pieces! What could have<br/>\n&gt; been this:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Document doc = new Document();<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; is now this:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; DocumentBuilderFactory factory = DocumentBuilderFactory.getInstance();<br/>\n&gt; DocumentBuilder builder = factory.newDocumentBuilder();<br/>\n&gt; Document doc = builder.newDocument();<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Be careful! The Builder pattern is by no means needed to create an <br/>\ninstance of an interface. JAXP/DOM combines, for whatever reason, the <br/>\nSingleton, Abstract Factory and Builder pattern, when all you really <br/>\nneed is this:<br/>\n<br/>\n     Document document = new WritableDocument();<br/>\n<br/>\nI could see using the Builder pattern to simplify the interface for <br/>\nconstructing a document, separating creating a document from reading it, <br/>\nbut by no means does JAXP/DOM do what it does because of /interfaces/.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s true that if you have a bunch of related interfaces (like in a GUI <br/>\ntoolkit), you might want an Abstract Factory, but neither Singleton nor <br/>\nBuilder enter the picture just because you have interfaces.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I fail to see how that&#39;s simpler.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It&#39;s not, and interfaces didn&#39;t make it more complex: the Singleton, <br/>\nAbstract Factory and Builder patterns did. If this is a representative <br/>\nexample of why you find interfaces unnecessarily complex, then I really <br/>\nbelieve you&#39;re blaming the wrong part of the design.<br/>\n<br/>\nTake care.<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJ.
