    "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1982166547\">On 09/27/2005 04:22 AM, Andrew Wilson apparently said:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Hi,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Ive written an HTML JUnit test runner.  Like the text runner, but<br/>\n&gt; generates HTML.  Obviously, this is implemented by the ANT tasks but,<br/>\n&gt; since we use a make build, this isnt terribly useful to me.  Its<br/>\n&gt; prototype code at the moment, but it works.  Ive implemented<br/>\n&gt; TestListener.  My columns currently include:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; - Test name<br/>\n&gt; - Output (with stderr coloured differently to stdout)<br/>\n&gt; - Problem (ie. Exception or Assert)<br/>\n&gt; - Time<br/>\n&gt; - Memory delta<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I use Velocity to do the formatting and stick some summary data at the<br/>\n&gt; top.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Has anyone else done one of these?  Is anyone else interested?  Should<br/>\n&gt; I publish the code?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Sure, publish it in the Files section of the group.  If anyone is truly <br/>\ninterested they will grab it.  I would suggest putting it in some <br/>\narchive format (jar/zip, tar, etc.) with whatever documentation is <br/>\nneeded to get one up and running.  Make sure to include the version <br/>\nnumbers of 3rd party libs you are using.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJason Rogers<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I,<br/>\nbut Christ liveth in me: and the life which I now live in<br/>\nthe flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved<br/>\nme, and gave himself for me.&quot;<br/>\n    Galatians 2:20</div>",
