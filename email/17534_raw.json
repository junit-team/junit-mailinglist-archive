Mike&#39;s chapter was very good, but it was  \nalmost pointedly devoid of TDD.  The test-later approach that the  \nchapter took left the example relatively untested.\n\nNevertheless I am very pleased with the testing orientation of Rails,  \nand am looking forward to seeing that very active and energetic  \ncommunity continue to embrace the disciplines of TDD.\n\n\n----\nRobert C.
