If you&#39;re mentioning the &quot;excluded.properties&quot; \nproblem, I \n&gt; bet you use the SwingRunner and this runner is well know to have \nseveral \n&gt; problems with the loading of classes.  So first try to execute your \n&gt; tests with the TextRunner.\n&gt; \n&gt; I haven&#39;t had a look at the eclipse junit runner but it may be \nbased on \n&gt; the TextRunner and not the SwingRunner.  If anyone can clarify this \n&gt; point, I&#39;d be thankfull (giving the cvs entry where I can have a \nlook at \n&gt; the implementation would be even better).\n&gt; \n&gt; -Vladimir\n&gt; \n&gt; -- \n&gt; Vladimir Bossicard\n&gt; www.bossicard.com\n\n\n",
