Well kinda. In HTML.\n\nTake a look at:  http://www.conco=\r\nrdion.org/\n\nReadable JUnit tests are difficult to write. You can put a desc=\r\nription\nof the behaviour in the name of the test method. E.g.\ntestStrikeDef=\r\naultsToSpotPrice()\nBut the internals of the method still tend to be a mess =\r\nof test data\nand plumbing code.\n\nThis is where Concordion steps in...\n\nBasi=\r\ncally the tool lets you write a requirement specification in plain\nEnglish =\r\nand then turn it into an automated JUnit test. It separates\ntest data and t=\r\nhe plumbing code.\n\nPlease try it out. The tutorial takes about 5-30 mins (d=\r\nepending on\nhow fast you type). The software is new and may have some rough=\r\n edges,\nbut I would really like some feedback about the idea, and gather\nsu=\r\nggestions for future enhancements etc.\n\nDavid\n\n\n\n\n\n",
