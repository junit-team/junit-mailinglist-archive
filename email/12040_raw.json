If not,\n&gt; can you picture how it must be done? Once all the stones are in place,\n&gt; they stay there because none of them can fall through the others. But\n&gt; how do you get them there in the first place? Image trying to hold all\n&gt; the stones in place simultaneously while you try to get the keystone\n&gt; set. You would drop a lot of them and get really frustrated. But a\n&gt; mason first builds a simple wooden form shaped like the interior of\n&gt; the arch and piles the stones on it. Then he takes it away when they\n&gt; are in place. Even though he has done this &quot;extra work&quot; of building\n&gt; the form, it is faster and more reliable to do it that way. It is the\n&gt; same thing with developer unit tests.\n\nHy,\n\nalthough I think you miss the original posters point (as he knows about \ntest-first and seems to use it when possible but asks what to do when he&#39;s \nforced to test-last) I like that analogy a lot. It really captures the \nessence of test-driven development and can probably be successfully used \nto describe tests-first to non-developers (PHB & Co).\n\nregards\nJoachim Sauer\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\n",
