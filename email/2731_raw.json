This is working great now, I&#39;ve\nimproved my testing coverage, and I got some refactoring experience.\n\n\nPCM (Paul Michali)\n\nCarrier Voice Gateway Business Unit (CVGBU)\nCisco Systems, Inc.\n250 Apollo Drive\nChelmsford, MA 01824\n\nPhone : (800) 572-6771 x 45817  (978) 244-5817 [direct]\nPaging: (800) 365-4578 [voice]  pcm@...
