I know I&#39;m getting a little philosfical here :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n    How can you guard against the unexpected? I mean, how at all is that<br/>\npossible?<br/>\n<br/>\nIn my point of view, as soon as you guard against something, that something<br/>\nwould no longer be unexpected, would it?<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, if you can insert an assertSomething(someVariable) method in your code,<br/>\nthe situation that the assert checks for is no longer unexpected, is it? And<br/>\nif it&#39;s no longer unexpected, you can throw a checked exception. But what<br/>\nhappens then if something _really unexpected_ happens? Well, your program<br/>\ncrashes, and it&#39;ll be hard to say how you should recover from such a<br/>\nsituation. I&#39;d prefer logging the incident to a file, and then stop<br/>\nexecution until some human intervention can be done.<br/>\n<br/>\n... but that&#39;s just my view of things... :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nJakob Jenkov</div>",
