I have a method on a class \nof mine that creates a jdom document from a file and gets the root \nelement name.  when i run my test using the junit.awtui.TestRunner it \nfails with a vague SAXBuilder.build error. when i run my test using \nthe junit.textui.TestRunner it runs fine.\n\nThe only reason I found this is because I kept running into problems \non something I know was working yesterday.  But yesterday I was not \nusing Junit to do the test.  I had my own test class.  So I went back \nand ran my test class... it still worked.\n\nAny ideas as to why this is happening?\n\nThanks,\nLiz\n\n\n",
