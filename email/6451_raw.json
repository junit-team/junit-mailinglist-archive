Please tone it down.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Oh, but it&#39;s my approach that was attacked with a groundless claim.  \n&gt; Sorry for wondering why.\n&gt; \n&gt;&gt;am asking you to tone it down. Just because we do not write\n&gt;&gt;novel-length, in-depth answers to your question does not mean that \n&gt; \n&gt; we\n&gt; \n&gt;&gt;are evading anything. It means that we are busy.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; HAHAHAHAHAHA!!  You guys are too much ...\n\nTo me Mike, you&#39;re coming across as rude. Someone saying they&#39;re too \nbusy to write an article right now is perfectly good reason - no-one \nhere has to answer your questions in your timeframe. Yet, I haven&#39;t \nseen any explanation as to what is inferior in your approach - \nasserting it&#39;s inferior does not make it so. I also found the waving \nof the moderator stick distasteful; it&#39;s far too early for that.\n\nA suggestion - stop posting for 24 hours on this thread, then come \nback to it.\n\nBill de h�ra\n\n\n\n",
