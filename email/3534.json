I have looked a lot of places for the answer, and<br/>\ni can&#39;t find a solution to my problem.  I have read the Junit best<br/>\npractices article (It deals with this issue) but it doesn&#39;t answer my<br/>\nspecific question.  I want to get access to a directory? Has anyone come<br/>\nacross this problem?<br/>\nDoes anyone have any advice or ideas on where to look?<br/>\nCheer&#39;s,<br/>\nCormac</div>",
