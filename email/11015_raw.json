You will not be able to specific everything (your  \nfirst attempts try to specify only what you think could break) and not  \neverything you have specified will be done so correctly (bugs in yours  \ntests).  Using other techniques like code coverage will help - as well  \nas the prescribed test-driven approach of making things fail before  \nthey pass.  If I am changing working (i.e. the associated tests pass)  \ncode - then I usually re-introduce the red bar prior to getting the  \ngreen bar.  No (at least almost no) line of code in the application is  \nadded unless it&#39;s role is to make a test pass.\n\nandrew f\n\n\nOn 7-May-04, at 10:19 AM, Reginald Braithwaite-Lee wrote:\n\n&gt; &quot;Code is frequently rewritten in ways that do not change its\n&gt; behaviour. A better algorithm is chosen, or the code is modified to\n&gt; fix a bug. Accepted wisdom is that the continued running of the\n&gt; existing unit-tests is sufficient proof that the code continues to\n&gt; work as intended. However, changing the code is likely to move the\n&gt; important edge-cases in ways that render existing tests pointless,\n&gt; and additional tests necessary.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; http://fishbowl.pastiche.org/2004/04/27/where_bugs_come_from\n&gt;\n&gt; --\n&gt; Reginald Braithwaite-Lee\n&gt; http://www.braithwaite-lee.com/\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------ Yahoo!
