Actually let me qualify that. It is not a good book unless\n&gt; =\r\nyou are heavily into EJB. It angles itself towards EJB using\n&gt; several diff=\r\nerent tools; however in each case you just get started\n&gt; and it jumps topic=\r\ns. So in that sense it is an intro book - just a\n&gt; bit too much intro and n=\r\not enough meat (using the word mastering is\n&gt; just a cruel joke). \n&gt; \n&gt; A m=\r\nore correct title would have been &quot;EJB using XP and Open Source\n&gt; Tools&quot;. \n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; A very disappointing book.\n\nJust wanted to make clear that you seem to=\r\n be talking about &quot;Java Tools\nfor Extreme Programming&quot; here, not about the =\r\nbook in the subject?!\n\nIlja\n\n\n\nTo unsubscribe from this group, send an emai=\r\nl to:\njunit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n \n\nYour use of Yahoo!
