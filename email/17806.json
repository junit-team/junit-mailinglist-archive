I release an extension of IAccount<br/>\ncalled IAccount2, that has a few extra methods, but I want to be able to<br/>\npass these IAccount2 objects to clients that expect IAccount, and the only<br/>\nway to do this is to have IAccount2 extend IAccount.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhich is why I was saying that since the Interface Segregation Principle<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t respect the is-a relationship, it&#39;s of little help for upgrade<br/>\nproblems, and the technique that I described in my initial message was the<br/>\nonly viable way to add methods to existing interfaces without breaking<br/>\nclients.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nCédric<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://testng.org\">http://testng.org</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",
