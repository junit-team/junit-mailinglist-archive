The\nmajority of the hamcrest matchers are in hamcrest-library, which can\nbe downloaded separately.  So, to get all of JUnit and all of\nHamcrest, without overlaps, you would download junit-x.x.jar, and\nhamcrest-library-x.x.jar.\n\nThere are downsides to this arrangement.  My initial guess is that the\nnumber of people who will find themselves with classpath problems\nbecause they&#39;re using an incompatible version of hamcrest-all will be\nless than the number who would have found themselves with classpath\nproblems because they don&#39;t have hamcrest, or couldn&#39;t figure out\nwhich junit jar to download.\n\nOf course, experience has a way of proving me wrong.  We&#39;ll see.\n\n   David Saff\n\nOn 7/29/07, Mauro Talevi &lt;mauro.talevi@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; David,\n&gt;\n&gt; David Saff wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; - To allow compatibility with a wide variety of possible matchers,\n&gt; &gt;   we have decided to include the classes from hamcrest-core,\n&gt; &gt;   from the [Hamcrest][] project.  This is the first time that\n&gt; &gt;   third-party classes have been included in JUnit.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; [Hamcrest]: http://code.google.com/p/hamcrest/\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Bundling classes from a dependent library in the jar will lead to classloader hell unless you\n&gt; change package name for the bundled classes.  jMock has Hamcrest as a mandatory but separate\n&gt; dependency.   Any reason you did not consider to do the same?  The compatibility motivation you cite\n&gt;   is not clear.  It is exactly for compatibility reasons that jars should be kept separate.  If a\n&gt; user wants to upgrade to a different version of hamcrest, it will conflict with the classes bundled.\n&gt;\n&gt; Alternatively, you could provide a *separate* jar (eg junit-all.jar) which bundles with the\n&gt; dependencies, but keeping junit.jar without dependendencies bundled.\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks and regards,\n&gt; Mauro\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; -------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; This SF.net email is sponsored by: Splunk Inc.\n&gt; Still grepping through log files to find problems?
