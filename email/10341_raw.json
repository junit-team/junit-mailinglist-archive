There seems to be a bug in the reporting of \nthose tests however, in that it will report a test run more than once even \nthough it really only runs it once.  I spent a few minutes stepping \nthrough the code to figure out where this behavior comes from but to no \navail (the truth is it wasn&#39;t worth my time).  I validated the tests \nweren&#39;t being run more than once though by putting breakpoints in the \ntests that were reported more than once -- the breakpoints only got hit \nonce.\n\nOn Thu, 29 Jan 2004 12:25:31 -0000, ernsthlg &lt;ernsthlg@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt; Hello,\n&gt;\n&gt; Is a tool out there, which generates suites for each package? Each\n&gt; suite should contain all tests of its package and all suites of the\n&gt; direct subpackages. Furthermore it should be able to update the\n&gt; relevant suites, if anywhere a new test was added.\n&gt;\n&gt; I seek for such a tool, because i am going to intigrate TestCases one\n&gt; by one to an existing large project. For now only a few tests exist,\n&gt; but they are spread over all the packages. To be able to execute these\n&gt; tests i want a root-suite which contains all existing tests. But i\n&gt; don´t want to write suites for each package by hand.\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks in advance,\n&gt;\n&gt; Helge\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
