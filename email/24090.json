That site has been<br/>\noperated and maintained by 8thlight.com for several years, and by Object<br/>\nMentor before that.  But it recently had a rather nasty failure, and it&#39;s<br/>\nnot clear when the content that had been hosted only there will come back.<br/>\n<br/>\nRather than spend a lot of effort recreating the old situation, I&#39;d like to<br/>\nmove us to a new situation, in which the team that develops JUnit is the<br/>\nsame one that develops the primary information sources about JUnit.  Along<br/>\nthose lines, I&#39;d like to get the github pages for JUnit ready to be a good<br/>\nnew home for junit.org.  These pages are hosted at<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://kentbeck.github.com/junit.\">http://kentbeck.github.com/junit.</a>  They&#39;re currently pretty sad, but they<br/>\ncan be edited by opening pull requests against<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://github.com/KentBeck/junit/tree/gh-pages.\">https://github.com/KentBeck/junit/tree/gh-pages.</a>  Ideally, it would be a<br/>\nvisually clean single page, with a short description of what JUnit is, and<br/>\nlinks to downloads, javadoc, mailing list, and the wiki (<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://github.com/kentbeck/junit/wiki)\">http://github.com/kentbeck/junit/wiki)</a>, which is itself incomplete, but<br/>\ngetting better day by day as a source of user documentation.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf anyone feels like rolling up their sleeves and give this a try, it would<br/>\nbe a great step forward.  I&#39;m out of the office all next week, but am happy<br/>\nto move quickly getting the pieces in place upon my return.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks, all,<br/>\n<br/>\n   David Saff<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",
