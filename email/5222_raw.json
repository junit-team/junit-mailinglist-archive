Indeed, it wasn&#39;t as clear as I intended.\n\nHere&#39;s another attempt at that FAQ.  I&#39;ve chosen to test some IO classes \nthat can possibly throw checked exceptions.  This demonstrates that \nunexpected checked exceptions are declared in the &#39;throws&#39; clause of the \ntest method.  It also tries to clarify what happens when unchecked \nexceptions are raised.\n\nIs this clearer?\n\n----\n\nQ: What&#39;s the difference between a failure and an error?\n\nA:\n\nAssertions are used to check for the possibility of failures, therefore failures are anticipated.  Errors are unanticipated problems resulting in uncaught exceptions being propagated from a JUnit test method. \n\nIn the following example, the FileNotFoundException is expected and checked with an assertion.  If the expected exception is not raised, then a failure is produced.  If any other unexpected IOException or unchecked exception (e.g. NullPointerException) is raised, the JUnit framework catches the exception and signals an error. \t\n\n    public void testNonexistentFileRead() throws IOException {\n        try {\n\n            File file = new File(&quot;doesNotExist.txt&quot;);\n            FileReader reader = new FileReader(file);\n            assertEquals(&#39;a&#39;, (char)reader.read());\n\t\t\t\n            fail(&quot;Should have thrown FileNotFoundException&quot;);\n\t\n        } catch (FileNotFoundException success) {}\n    }   \n\nIn the following example, an IOException is not expected.  The JUnit framework will signal an error if an IOException (e.g. FileNotFoundException) or any unchecked exception (e.g. NullPointerException) is raised. \t\n\n    public void testExistingFileRead() throws IOException {\n\n        File file = new File(&quot;exists.txt&quot;);\n        FileReader reader = new FileReader(file);\n\t\t\t\n        assertEquals(&#39;a&#39;, (char)reader.read());\n    }\n\nBoth failures and errors will cause the test to fail.  However, it is useful to differentiate between failures and errors because the debugging process is slightly different.  \n\nIn the first example, the use of fail() will not generate a complete stack trace including the method that raised the exception.  In this case that&#39;s sufficient since we anticipate that the exception will be raised.  If it&#39;s not raised, then it&#39;s a problem with the test itself.  \n\nIn the second example,  the JUnit framework catches the exception and generates an error with a complete stack trace for the exception.  Since we don&#39;t expect this exception to be raised, a complete stack trace is useful in debugging why it was raised.\n\n----\n\nMike\n\n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n",
