I might even declare them final and skip<br/>\nthe @BeforeClass and @AfterClass completely.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for the rest of the discussion which I really wish I could follow during<br/>\nthe day, but have to wait until I get home in the evening, I like the idea<br/>\nof trying the more test driven approach. Not totally convinced that&#39;ll work<br/>\nin this example, but worth a try. Also, I&#39;m trying to get up to speed on the<br/>\nnew Theories as they might fit some of the invariant nature of the<br/>\nmathematics involved with fractions. (I&#39;m still stuck in a timewarp back at<br/>\nJUnit 4.0)<br/>\n<br/>\n(As an aside, this is why I teach JUnit using simple objects, because then<br/>\nthe object is simple enough to fade into the background, leaving just the<br/>\nunit testing principles and approaches to be mentally wrangled.)<br/>\n<br/>\nDavid: on first inspection, I found your code to be very terse. This is a<br/>\ngood thing in some situations, but this code was/is designed for teaching<br/>\nand that&#39;s why I created variables with names like oneHalf and threeFifths,<br/>\nso that the lines of code would read better. There&#39;s method to my madness!<br/>\n<br/>\nI like the concept of valuing more than just code coverage in our tests and<br/>\nthe thought of domain coverage through well chosen test data is an appealing<br/>\none. I&#39;ll give that some more thought.<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you for a most interesting discussion.<br/>\n<br/>\nSimon<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n2010/8/22 Cédric Beust ♔ &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:cedric@...\">cedric@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Simon,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Actually, I was wrong: using @BeforeClass will break your tests. Since<br/>\n&gt; JUnit<br/>\n&gt; reinstantiates a brand new class before each test method, only the first<br/>\n&gt; method will get the correct values for these fields. Subsequent methods<br/>\n&gt; will<br/>\n&gt; see null.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>-- <br/>\nsimonpeter.org | simonpeter.com | newlife-upc.org<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",
