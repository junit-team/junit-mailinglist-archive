A\ndedicated integration tester or end-to-end tester seems about right.\n\nI feel appropriately inspired. Let me write the article, then I&#39;ll be\nback. :)\n\nSo said  Jeff Tulley  on  2/21/2003 --------------------\n\n&gt;How do you do TDD with a separate, independent tester?\n&gt; That goes against what TDD is, unless the tester is\n&gt;pair programming with the developer.\n&gt;\n&gt;I do sometimes worry though that my testcode doesn&#39;t\n&gt;test the boundary cases too well since it is not my\n&gt;dedicated job to make the code break.  But, with TDD\n&gt;my code is 90-100% tested whereas otherwise it would\n&gt;be 10% (if that).  That is such a marked improvement\n&gt;that I think it is well worth it, even without\n&gt;independent testing.\n&gt;\n&gt;---- Lauren Bish wrote: -----\n&gt;I should have added that I find it useful to have both\n&gt;TDD and Unit \n&gt;testing\n&gt;that is done by a dedicated unit tester. Not many\n&gt;developers have the \n&gt;proper\n&gt;attitude for testing; testing takes a somewhat\n&gt;destructive attitude, \n&gt;while\n&gt;writing code is a creative process. Also, many\n&gt;developers don&#39;t have \n&gt;the\n&gt;aptitude or expertise for testing. This is not a slam\n&gt;on developers, \n&gt;just a\n&gt;recognition that testing and developing (both of which\n&gt;I have done) are \n&gt;two\n&gt;different areas of expertise.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;__________________________________________________\n&gt;Do you Yahoo!?\n&gt;Yahoo!
