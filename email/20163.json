    "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1259361054\">I&#39;m using Eclipse 3.3 with JUnit 4.4.  In the olden days, with Eclipse<br/>\n3.0 and JUnit 3.8, I could select a single test method in the Outline<br/>\nview and run just that method.  Nowadays, whenever I try to do that,<br/>\nEclipse&#39;s test runner runs all the tests in the class.  The results are<br/>\nshown in a tree, and the tests I didn&#39;t ask to be run are all under a<br/>\nnode called &quot;Unrooted Tests [Runner: JUnit 4]&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, I figured there must be some simple explanation, and immediately did<br/>\na Google search.  And it found nothing on topic.  So I searched the<br/>\nEclipse documentation and website for &quot;unrooted tests&quot; and again got<br/>\nnothing.  So I searched on this Yahoo Group&#39;s message archive, and again<br/>\nfound nothing.<br/>\n<br/>\nAm I the only person in the world who has ever had this problem with<br/>\nrunning a single test method from Eclipse?  Or am I searching for the<br/>\nweb&#39;s most suppressed secret?<br/>\n<br/>\nSomeone please tell me you&#39;ve seen this problem too!  And why is there<br/>\nnothing written up about these mysterious &quot;Unrooted Tests&quot; in all the<br/>\nplaces I looked?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers,<br/>\nTodd.<br/>\n----<br/>\nTodd Bradley - Polycom, Inc.<br/>\nReadiVideo QA Lead</div>",
