Something like this\n&gt;\n&gt; public class MyClassTest extends RegressionTest {\n&gt; @Test\n&gt; public void myIntegrationTest() {\n&gt; MyClass myOutput = Whatever.StoryTest();\n&gt;\n&gt; // This is a standard assertion, part of the story test.\n&gt; // It always gets executed.\n&gt; assertTrue(&quot;A reasonable amount&quot;, output.GetAmount() &lt; 50);\n&gt;\n&gt; // This does something different depending on what &quot;mode&quot; the test is\n&gt; running in.\n&gt; // The last argument is the tolerance for float comparisons\n&gt; assertNoRegression(&quot;Regression-testing myOutput&quot;, myObject, 10e-2);\n&gt; }\n&gt; }\n&gt;\n&gt; Do you think this can be achieved in Java?\n&gt;\nI think so, though I haven&#39;t tried it. Here&#39;s an approach that occurs to me:\n\n- Declare the mode via a property on the command line.\n\n- Do assertions using objects rather than static methods. One asserter\nobject does nothing. Another saves the actual result without comparing. The\nthird compares actual to saved.\n\n- Use a factory to supply the appropriate asserter object, depending on the\nmode.\n\nDale\n\n-- \nDale Emery\nConsultant to software teams and leaders\nWeb: http://dhemery.com\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n",
