The moment there&#39;s a great,<br/>\nauthoritative master location to link to, I&#39;ll do what it takes to<br/>\nkill sourceforge and point it there.<br/>\n<br/>\njunit.org is an oddity.  For reasons that predate me and I only dimly<br/>\nunderstand, junit.org was registered back in 2000 by Object Mentor.<br/>\nTo my knowledge, it has never been actively maintained by any of the<br/>\nactive maintainers of the JUnit source.  The site currently there<br/>\n(developed by Ben Rady and a merry crew roughly four years ago) is one<br/>\nof the better incarnations of the site.  However, its design<br/>\npresupposed that the junit.org site itself would serve as an active<br/>\ncommunity, and I think that never fully materialized, with this<br/>\nmailing list and, now, github, being the main points of vibrancy.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo me, I think the ultimate solution would be a site accessible at<br/>\nhttp://junit.org, backed by github pages at<br/>\nhttp://junit-team.github.com/, making available a superset of the<br/>\ninformation available at the current junit.org site.  I&#39;d have to talk<br/>\nto a couple of stakeholders to see if this can be made to happen.<br/>\n<br/>\n   David Saff<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Thu, Sep 8, 2011 at 5:43 PM, Stefan Birkner &lt;mail@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; The information about JUnit is across three different places: junit.org, junit.sourceforge.net and github.

This makes it easier to find the information and JUnit would look more professional. IMHO the github pages are a good place for the JUnit documentation, because we can use all the git(hub) features for creating the documentation.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; What do you think?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Stefan Birkner<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Yahoo!
