I have to get a suite of automated tests done by the end of this week\nso I did it without completely understanding junit but I knew what I wanted\nto get out of it.  The tests I need to run are highly specialized (they&#39;re\nthe same with different inputs).\n\nI wanted a list of test cases so I know what test cases I&#39;ve run against a\nbuild (hey I&#39;m a qa person, I have to know what&#39;s in there not only what\nfailed - esp. from a test coverage perspective).  I also wanted it in a\nformat anyone could easily view, so I store the test results in a vector\nthat I dump out in an html format at the end (the location is hardcoded for\nnow but it&#39;ll eventually come from a property file).\n\nAnyway, I confronted the same issue you had with the listener so I made my\nown testresult object that the testcase class initializes and the listener\ngrabs it from it.\n\nI&#39;ll send it to you but I don&#39;t think it fits into the junit way of\nthinking.\n\n\n\n\n  -----Original Message-----\n  From: Jesse Marlin [mailto:jlm@...]\n  Sent: Tuesday, April 15, 2003 03:36 PM\n  To: junit@yahoogroups.com\n  Subject: RE: [junit] Identify name of the TestCase\n\n\n  J.

Upload it to the file section. Get your\nname in lights.\n\n  I agree.  I am having a difficult time finding substantive examples,\n  and am currently struggling with TestListener.  I don&#39;t understand\n  the relationship between a TestResult and a TestCase.  TestResult\n  actually has the addListener method which I need, but I am not sure\n  what to do to get a TestResult from the context of a TestCase.\n\n        Yahoo!
