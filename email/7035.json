Currently<br/>\n&gt; some of these tests fail with the<br/>\n&gt;     [junit] Problem creating<br/>\n&gt; javax.swing.plaf.metal.MetalLookAndFeel with method<br/>\n&gt; getMenuTextFont and args { : java.lang.reflect.InvocationTargetException<br/>\n&gt; error and some of them I have &quot;fixed&quot; to catch that error and not fail.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I like neither of these solutions. I would like to catch the error and<br/>\n&gt; throw an &quot;inconclusive&quot;-error to the JUnit framework because conceptually<br/>\n&gt; these tests have neither passed, nor found any problem.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Whoa -- what you have described is the essence of the distinction between an<br/>\nerror and a failure.  An error is a test that does not pass because of an<br/>\nunexpected problem, like a screwed up environment.  I think your errors are<br/>\nlegit and you shouldn&#39;t treat them as failures.  They&#39;re legit because they<br/>\nsignal a problem with the test harness environment.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; The alterative solution would be to just have two set of tests, one that<br/>\n&gt; are runnable without the window system and one that is not and run them<br/>\n&gt; both when a window system is available and just the one of them when it<br/>\n&gt; is not but this is a lot more complicated since we then risk to forget<br/>\n&gt; running some of the tests some of the times.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>What if you solve the environment problem by either using JDK 1.4, which<br/>\nsupports AWT in a windowless environment (may require a runtime setting --<br/>\nsee the JDK docs), or install Xvfb (X virtual frame buffer) to emulate a<br/>\nrunning X server?  You may have Xvfb installed already.  If not, it can<br/>\neasily be found via Google.<br/>\n<br/>\nScott Stirling</div>",
