When I test, I want to be able to configure the environment o=\r\nf my\ncode as much as possible.  My test code creates many different situati=\r\nons\nfor my code under test.  This way I know that my code under test can pe=\r\nrform\nin different scenarios.  To enable this ability, I like to limit my\nc=\r\nonfiguration, so my code under test is as nimble as possible.  It should\nwo=\r\nrk under many configurations and not depend &quot;too much&quot; on resource files,\np=\r\nroject configurations, the weather, a specific server...\n\nI think number 2 =\r\n& 3 are the same.  Where I work, we are leaning towards\nshipping the test c=\r\node in our distributable.  It is an option to install,\nwhich shows the conf=\r\nidence we have in our code base.  All the tests pass,\nand you know what&#39;s u=\r\nnder test will work.  I&#39;ve seen some companies required\nto show coverage an=\r\nalysis along with the tests to prove the code is\nexercised before it is ins=\r\ntalled. We are lucky that our customer is\ninternal.\n\nFor reason number 4...=\r\n  If I had to maintain two sets of libraries, I&#39;d have\nproblems figuring ou=\r\nt which version of a jar I&#39;m using.  Especially when my\ntest code calls int=\r\no my code under test with one of the shared jars.  (Is\nthis the &quot;jar hell&quot; =\r\nmany speak of?)  If one follows the apache version\nnumber conventions... th=\r\nere are problems with changing the x and y numbers\nin a x.y.z version schem=\r\ne between projects.\n\nWhy should the test code have additional functionality=\r\n that the code under\ntest can&#39;t.  Is the test code performing the same work=\r\n as the production\ncode.  I like to limit my test code to set up, tear down=\r\n, and assertions\nlogic.  If I&#39;m doing something that the code under test sh=\r\nould do, I wonder\nwhy it is so hard to test.  (In those cases maybe I wrote=\r\n a bad API for\nmyself.)\n\nBasically, when it comes down to it... I&#39;m lazy an=\r\nd hate having to set up\ntwo environments.  I already pull my hair out when =\r\nant and eclipse function\ndifferently because someone, &lt;cough &quot;myself&quot;/&gt; for=\r\ngets to make the\nclasspaths match.\n\n\nOn Thu, Feb 11, 2010 at 3:28 PM, willm=\r\ncqueen &lt;willmcqueen@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi,\n&gt;\n&gt; Has anyone out there t=\r\nried moving all of your JUnit test cases into a\n&gt; separate Eclipse project,=\r\n rather than keeping them within your main project?\n&gt;\n&gt; I couldn&#39;t find any=\r\n info on this option when I searched on google for\n&gt; &quot;junit separate eclips=\r\ne project&quot; and &quot;junit different eclipse project&quot;. I\n&gt; looked through the JU=\r\nnit FAQ, and found this:\n&gt; http://junit.sourceforge.net/doc/faq/faq.htm#org=\r\nanize_1\n&gt; ...which describes having parallel source folders within the same=\r\n project\n&gt; -- one for main code, and one for test code. But nothing found a=\r\nbout having\n&gt; separate projects.\n&gt;\n&gt; I see the following advantages in havi=\r\nng a separate Eclipse project for the\n&gt; JUnit tests:\n&gt;\n&gt; 1) The ability to =\r\nset your project-specific settings for your test project\n&gt; to something oth=\r\ner than what is set for the main project. Not all project\n&gt; settings are av=\r\nailable in the runtime configs (such as builder\n&gt; configurations), and so m=\r\noving the test code to a separate project would\n&gt; allow for setting whateve=\r\nr test-specific project settings are desired. The\n&gt; main project can be add=\r\ned as a project dependency of the test project, and\n&gt; so the parallel sourc=\r\ne dirs design can still exist and the test project can\n&gt; continue to access=\r\n all of the main project&#39;s code.\n&gt;\n&gt; 2) Reduced risk in having your main co=\r\nde accidentally depend on a test (not\n&gt; likely to happen, but possible with=\r\n single project).\n&gt;\n&gt; 3) Reduced risk in accidentally shipping test-specifi=\r\nc jars with your\n&gt; production code.\n&gt;\n&gt; 4) The freedom to add any version o=\r\nf a lib that you need for your tests.\n&gt; For example, let&#39;s say that your ma=\r\nin code depends on\n&gt; google-collections-0.9.jar. And your tests can benefit=\r\n from some new method\n&gt; introduced in a new version -- google-collection-1.=\r\n0.jar. So, you&#39;d like to\n&gt; use v1.0 with your test code but don&#39;t want to t=\r\nouch the main code&#39;s libs.\n&gt; If you have a separate test project, then that=\r\n&#39;s not a problem -- you just\n&gt; add v1.0 to the test project&#39;s lib dir. But =\r\nif you have a single main\n&gt; project that includes your test code, then your=\r\n either stuck with v0.9 -- or\n&gt; you&#39;ll have to use a custom classloader to =\r\nload your entire test code (and\n&gt; the test-specific libs) so that you can l=\r\noad v1.0 and not v0.9.\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;d say that the separate-project-option would d=\r\no well when needing\n&gt; test-specific project settings and with dealing with =\r\ntransitive\n&gt; dependencies.\n&gt;\n&gt; For the disadvantages of having a separate p=\r\nroject, I can&#39;t think of any\n&gt; besides:\n&gt; 1) Having one more project to mai=\r\nntain. Is that really a disadvantage,\n&gt; though? Maybe.\n&gt;\n&gt; Can you list any=\r\n other disadvantages?\n&gt;\n&gt; Maybe a more fundamental question is: Should an e=\r\nclipse project that\n&gt; contains your production code (and jars used by your =\r\nproduction code at\n&gt; runtime) also contain non-production code (eg, test co=\r\nde and test-specific\n&gt; jars) or should non-production code+artifacts be pla=\r\nced in a separate\n&gt; Eclipse project while still maintaining a parallel dir =\r\nstructure for tests?\n&gt;\n&gt; I welcome all your thoughts! Thank you.\n&gt;\n&gt; Cheers=\r\n,\n&gt; Will\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n",
