I am interested in the following:\n\n1. Easily obtaining implemented CORBA server objects into my client\nfor testing, and\n\n2. Testing the CORBA server objects in the server itself (and in the\nserver&#39;s JVM)\n\nI&#39;ve looked at Apache&#39;s Cactus and found it only offering testing on\nEJB-type solutions. I&#39;ve also looked at possibly extending the Cactus\nRedirectorProxy, but am not sure how to implement for CORBA use\n(rather than Servelet, JSP, etc.).\n\nAny insight into a solution to my questions would be greatly\nappreciated.\n\nThank you for your time and response.\n\n-Rick\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
