If you&#39;re stuffing the event queue, there&#39;s not much you \ncan do unless JFCUnit has some built-in delays or is slow in and of \nitself (doubtful).\n\nThe bottom line is that eventually, you will have more tests than you \nhave time, so you&#39;ll need to reorganize them in a sensible way so they \nare grouped around related code/functionality.\n\nOn Monday, September 22, 2003, at 01:52 AM, cpac_22 wrote:\n\n&gt; I&#39;m currently using jfcunit (and learning as I go), I&#39;ve got a set of\n&gt; test cases that working 100% but it takes 6 minutes to run them,\n&gt; because the mouse is moving slow.
