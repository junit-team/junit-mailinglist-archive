B. Rainsberger wrote:\n\n&gt; I gather your test suites run quickly enough to get enough feedback to \n&gt; keep you happy. Mine don&#39;t, so I want faster feedback, and more stuff \n&gt; running in memory makes that happen.\n\nSometimes you need to do that, but when that happens I tend to split the \ntest suite into a full version and a compact version. The full version \ncan be run automatically and repeatedly on a build server. If it takes \nan hour or even 24 hours to run, it&#39;s no big deal, as long as the \ncompact version runs quickly.\n\nI also sometimes reorganize test suites so I run just the subset that \nseems most likely to touch the code I&#39;m working on. That can also reduce \nbuild times to manageable levels.\n\n&gt; A question: when you test business logic that touches a relational \n&gt; database, do you just put up with how slow those tests are? If not, what \n&gt; do you do? HSQLDB? Something else?\n&gt; \n\nI haven&#39;t done a lot of RDB testing. My slowest tests mostly involve \nnetwork connections and web servers. For that, I either put up with the \nslowness or subset the tests as described above. I suppose I could build \n  a web server into my test suite, but honestly that&#39;s never been the \nsimplest thing that could possibly work for me. :-) If it ever becomes a \nmajor problem, I might consider it.\n\n-- \n﻿Elliotte Rusty Harold  elharo@...\nJava I/O 2nd Edition Just Published!\nhttp://www.cafeaulait.org/books/javaio2/\nhttp://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0596527500/ref=nosim/cafeaulaitA/\n\n",
