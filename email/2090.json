But I<br/>\n&gt; really don&#39;t think that this will solve problems:<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yes, changing that aspect of the framework would be a very significant,<br/>\nand challenging, change. It&#39;d be interesting to see how well it could<br/>\nbe done without having to change other interfaces or any existing<br/>\ntests. Perhaps by having the assert* methods find the test context (a<br/>\nslightly new/changed concept) in which they are running and logging the<br/>\nfailure there.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;    assertTrue(obj != null);<br/>\n&gt;    assertTrue(obj.status() == 3);<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This would throw a NullPointerException (we really can&#39;t change the<br/>\nbehavior of the JVM) in the second assertTrue. The framework might deal<br/>\nwith an Exception from a test that had already failed an assertion as<br/>\nmeaningless and not to be recorded, or might be clever about what<br/>\nshould be recorded.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother example:<br/>\n<br/>\n  // For two arrays: expected, actual<br/>\n  assertEquals(expected.length, actual.length);<br/>\n  for (int i = Math.min(expected.length-1, actual.length-1); i &gt;= 0;<br/>\ni--) <br/>\n  {<br/>\n    assertEquals(expected[i], actual[i]);<br/>\n  }<br/>\n<br/>\nThis would log a complete list of incorrect elements in addition to the<br/>\nsize being wrong. So, this example just goes to show that multiple<br/>\nreporting might be helpful in some circumstances. Obviously not all,<br/>\nand quite possibly not useful enough for the sizeable and challenging<br/>\nframework change required to support it.<br/>\n<br/>\nRegards,<br/>\n<br/>\nRob<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nMake international calls for as low as $.04/minute with Yahoo!
