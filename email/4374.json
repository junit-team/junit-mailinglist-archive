The final goal would be to have the tool<br/>\n&gt;comparing the class to the test_class and create stubs for new methods<br/>\n&gt;while leaving the existing ones untouched. &lt;snip /&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Folks, I know I&#39;m a broken record on this one, but...<br/>\n<br/>\n...let&#39;s not forget that testing is a mindful activity, and not a mindless <br/>\nactivity. Generating test stubs, especially from classes already written, <br/>\nrelieves you of the need to think about what you&#39;re testing. This is a bad <br/>\nthing, and often a Bad Thing.<br/>\n<br/>\nDo you really need to test every method on your class? Can you remove them <br/>\ninstead? Can you consolidate them into a smaller number of methods? Should <br/>\nthey be on other classes? These are all questions that you should ask <br/>\n*especially* before writing tests for code already written. Particularly if <br/>\nyou didn&#39;t write the code but need to write the tests. By writing the tests, <br/>\none by one, thinking clearly about what feature (not method) you&#39;re testing, <br/>\nyou are forced to answer all these questions. This helps your design. That&#39;s <br/>\na Good Thing.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf the original poster has already thought of all that and decided that <br/>\ngenerating test stubs is appropriate, then that&#39;s great; but if not, he <br/>\nshould reconsider before diving in. I&#39;ve been there, and it wasn&#39;t a fun <br/>\ntrip.<br/>\n<br/>\nDon&#39;t mind me.<br/>\n<br/>\nJ. B.
