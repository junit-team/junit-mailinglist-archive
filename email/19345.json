Smalltalkers and Rubyists love it, others hate it. It&#39;s<br/>\n&gt;  the most creative use of Java I&#39;ve ever seen and if the API fails, I<br/>\n&gt;  blame Java, not JMock.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  From their web site:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  context.checking(new Expectations() {{<br/>\n&gt;       one (subscriber).receive(message);<br/>\n&gt;  }});<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  subscriber is the mock object whose expecting receive(message) once.

And you have presented only the first code line from the<br/>\nexample, which is still unreadable: one(subscriber): does mean in fact<br/>\nthat subscriber will receive ONE message and not what the english<br/>\nreading of that code implies. And this is clear once you are using the<br/>\nother methods.<br/>\nThe following lines of the sample are becoming even more readable as<br/>\nthey are completely disconnected from the previous. Comparing this<br/>\nwith:<br/>\n<br/>\nexpect(myobject.doSomething()).andReturn()<br/>\n<br/>\nI still find this last one more readable. But, I have to agree this is<br/>\nmore a matter of taste, and so I will not argue on (in fact I said it<br/>\nfrom the beginning that my ranking is a matter of taste and experience<br/>\nwith these frameworks and not something I am absolute about).<br/>\n<br/>\nbests,<br/>\n<br/>\n./alex<br/>\n--<br/>\n.w( the_mindstorm )p.<br/>\n  TestNG co-founder<br/>\nEclipseTestNG Creator<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;  --<br/>\n&gt;  J.
