(we had to - it&#39;s a really needed tool)\n&gt;\n&gt; And I&#39;m not satisfied with the result and the TDD-ing we did ... But\nbefore\n&gt; I share my questions and concerns, I&#39;d like to see how TDDing our\nassignment\n&gt; would or should really work. For this,\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I invite you to also implement the tool we had to write. &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;\n&gt;\n&gt; For this, I have put a sort of spec on my website at\n&gt; http://www.haraldmmueller.de/swe_tdd1.html.\n&gt;\n&gt; It took us 2 hours 16 minutes end-to-end (including the shaky acceptance\n&gt; test on the website), and we were as unknowing about doclets as one can\nbe -\n&gt; so you have every chance to do the same thing in an hour or so.\n&gt;\n&gt; Everyone sending me (or posting) a &quot;TDD solution&quot; (including unit tests)\n&gt; will get in return our code ... if you like to criticize others&#39; code,\nthat\n&gt; should really be an incentive ;-)\n&gt;\n&gt; When I have two working solutions, I&#39;ll post - if I may - our code (maybe\non\n&gt; the refactoring mailing list? don&#39;t know where it suites better) so that\nyou\n&gt; can tear it apart.\n&gt;\n&gt; Is this a deal ;-) ?\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; JB (Joe - now I know it!) Rainsberger found time to answer - I&#39;ll only\n&gt; comment on one part:\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;Now fortunately, RootDoc is an interface, so we ought to be able to mock\n&gt; &gt;it, or provide a simple implementation of it, to pass in to the method\n&gt; &gt;start(), which I /assume/ you&#39;re trying to test-drive.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Yes, but ...&quot; (my children&#39;s answer to almost everything ...): If you\nlook\n&gt; at the documentation of RootDoc and related interfaces - i.e., the javadoc\n&gt; API -, it&#39;s not too small. Should I really mock this? I cannot see that\nI&#39;ll\n&gt; then create a software that will run with the real javadoc API - I will\n&gt; misinterpret the Javadoc and implement mocks that do what I think they\n&gt; should do, not what the real thing does.\n&gt; So, I need learning tests for RootDoc etc. anyway, so why not write the\n&gt; doclet so that *is* the learning test object?\n&gt; But when I find time, I&#39;ll try also the mock approach - otherwise, I&#39;ll\n&gt; never lose my prejudice about it; and post the result without any feeling\nof\n&gt; guilt.\n&gt;\n&gt; Ok - now I&#39;m waiting for contributions ...\n&gt;\n&gt; Regards\n&gt; Harald M.
