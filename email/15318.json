    "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1506644075\">Elliotte,<br/>\n<br/>\nMy early experiences writing frameworks were in Smalltalk where the audience for the framework was no larger than the team. In Smalltalk, all data is protected and all methods are public. This caused very few problems in practice and gave framework users a lot of flexibility. My urge to make methods protected comes from my experience that good coding practice (Composed Method, for instance) creates many methods which would make excellent hooks, but that when I wrote the framework I wasn&#39;t very good at guessing which methods would be useful hooks and which were just good factoring. In a framework used &quot;among friends&quot;, where you can refactor all the client code, protected data/public methods is a reasonable practice.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, as Erich is at pains to explain to me frequently, that is not the context in which we are writing JUnit. We need to balance the need for flexibility of extension with the need for flexibility of design evolution. Revealing all the details of our implementation means we can&#39;t change anything. And so we are left, as you said, revealing only as much as we are certain will be useful.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis leaves me unsettled. I know that my frameworks aren&#39;t as useful as they could be, but I also know that I would regret opening them up completely. I don&#39;t see how to strike a better balance than we strike with JUnit, though, so I&#39;ll live with it.<br/>\n<br/>\nSincerely yours,<br/>\n<br/>\nKent Beck<br/>\nThree Rivers Institute<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a>] On <br/>\n&gt; Behalf Of Elliotte Harold<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Sunday, October 30, 2005 10:59 PM<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: [junit] JUnit 4 restructuring<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Kent Beck wrote:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; In general, I prefer to make all non-externally-visible <br/>\n&gt; methods protected,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; since I don&#39;t know a priori which ones will prove useful as <br/>\n&gt; hooks for<br/>\n&gt; &gt; further extension.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I read this just before I went away on vacation and almost <br/>\n&gt; fell out of <br/>\n&gt; my chair. I gave myself ten days to cool off and then came <br/>\n&gt; back to it, <br/>\n&gt; and it still shocked me. I&#39;ve heard claims like this before, but I&#39;m <br/>\n&gt; astounded to hear it from the co-author of Extreme <br/>\n&gt; Programming. This is <br/>\n&gt; a horrible coding practice that flies in the face of good agile <br/>\n&gt; development practices and basic object oriented principles.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Basic OOP: keep everything as private as you possibly can. This gives <br/>\n&gt; you maximum flexibility for future development and change. <br/>\n&gt; Anything that <br/>\n&gt; is private can be refactored or changed as needed for any reason that <br/>\n&gt; arises. Once you publish an interface as either protected or public <br/>\n&gt; you&#39;re stuck with it. You can&#39;t change it later for performance or <br/>\n&gt; changing requirements or to fix a mistake. People may be depending on <br/>\n&gt; it. This mandates that you don&#39;t put anything into your interfaces <br/>\n&gt; unless you&#39;re really, really sure it&#39;s right. If you leave <br/>\n&gt; something out <br/>\n&gt; for which a use case is later demonstrated, you can always put it in. <br/>\n&gt; You can almost always change a method from private to <br/>\n&gt; protected without <br/>\n&gt; breaking anyone&#39;s code. However, you cannot go the other way.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Basic Agile: You Ain&#39;t Going to Need It (YAGNI). Why make the <br/>\n&gt; effort to <br/>\n&gt; create a protected method that more than likely will never be used or <br/>\n&gt; will be used so rarely it won&#39;t even pay back the complexity <br/>\n&gt; cost of the <br/>\n&gt; extra JavaDoc? Designing for subclassing is hard. It takes <br/>\n&gt; roughly three <br/>\n&gt; times as much effort as designing a final class, maybe more. Most <br/>\n&gt; non-final classes in the wild are fundamentally broken. Of course <br/>\n&gt; sometimes you do need subclasses, but don&#39;t go adding <br/>\n&gt; extension points <br/>\n&gt; willy-nilly until you&#39;re ready to design them properly, document them <br/>\n&gt; fully, consider their implications for other dependent <br/>\n&gt; methods, and do <br/>\n&gt; all the other hard work required to create a truly extensible class. <br/>\n&gt; Java erred by not making final the default, but there&#39;s no reason we <br/>\n&gt; have to repeat its mistakes.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -- <br/>\n&gt; ﻿Elliotte Rusty Harold  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:elharo@...\">elharo@...</a><br/>\n&gt; XML in a Nutshell 3rd Edition Just Published!<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.cafeconleche.org/books/xian3/\">http://www.cafeconleche.org/books/xian3/</a><br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0596007647/cafeaulaitA/\">http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0596007647/cafeaulaitA/</a><br/>\n&gt; ref=nosim<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------ Yahoo!
