HTMLUnit models web page interaction, whereas \n&gt; HTTPUnit modeled (past tense) HTTP requests and responses. It is my \n&gt; understanding that HTTPUnit is more like HTMLUnit these days, although I \n&gt; haven&#39;t used it since 2002, so I can&#39;t be sure. (I&#39;m going by what \n&gt; Russell Gold has told me.) If that&#39;s true, then it&#39;s largely a matter of \n&gt; taste.\n&gt; \n&gt; Try HTTPUnit first, then HTMLUnit. If HTMLUnit is really so much better, \n&gt; then you&#39;ll switch; and if not, then you won&#39;t. Me, I use HTMLUnit, but \n&gt; mostly because I almost always have.\n&gt; -- \n&gt; J. B.
