JB does.  We&#39;re not alone.\n\n&gt; I document everything. even tests!\n\nWhy?  What would happen if you didn&#39;t?  How much time is wasted by\nwriting & maintaining those comments?\n\nDo you program by intention?  Why isn&#39;t your code written to express\nwhat it does, what your intent was when you wrote it?  Why do you need\nto write that separately?\n\n&gt; Especially since I am in a large company setting, if the next guy\ncomes along at looks at my tests, he can see some of the comments I\nhave made.\n\nWouldn&#39;t it be better if they could just look at the code and see what\nit does.  If they can do that, then what use are the comments?\n\nHow do they know the comments are up to date?\n\n&gt; Maybe not make some of the same mistakes. etc...\n\nIf something is done a certain way for a reason (e.g. performance\ntuning, using a specific algorithm, etc.) then a short comment is\nreasonable.\n\n&gt; It is never, ever, a bad idea to document.\n\nYes, quite often it is.  If you feel the need to write a comment,\nconsider refactoring the code to make the comment unneccessary.\n\nAll this has been said in amany place by many people.  I suggest you\nread &quot;Refactoring&quot; by Martin Fowler and my new book &quot;TDD: A Practical\nGuide&quot;.\n\nThat said there are valid times to document if it has value to the\ncustomer or is needed/reasonable to set up for the next game (e.g.\n&quot;maintenance&quot;).\n\nDave\n\nps.  I&#39;m thinking about writing a book on programming by intention. \nComments?  feedback?\n\n\n\n",
