However I have also been asked to find <br/>\nmetrics for funtion caller/called with locations (line #, etc), <br/>\ntotals of what programs use a specific method, etc.  Looked at CDOC <br/>\nfor Java, C++, and C. Wondering if anyone has used the metric <br/>\nportions of JEDIT or if you know of a tool &quot;that will do it all&quot;.</div>",
