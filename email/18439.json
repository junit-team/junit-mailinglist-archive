When you use the try/catch<br/>\n&gt;&gt;form you can move some of your action code above the try. The problem<br/>\n&gt;&gt;with the annotation solution is that it doesn&#39;t point out the call that<br/>\n&gt;&gt;is supposed to throw the exception: it could be any call in the test<br/>\n&gt;&gt;method.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;    <br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;True, but in practice, what is the likelihood that in the same test method,<br/>\n&gt;you have several calls that can throw the same exception and that during<br/>\n&gt;your test run, it&#39;s the wrong one that throws it?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;It&#39;s pretty unlikely in my experience, especially if you are writing unit<br/>\n&gt;tests which, by definition, should have minimal bodies of code.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;At any rate, the annotation approach is really a 90/10 kind of situation:<br/>\n&gt;it addresses in a concise and readable form 90% of your exception tests and<br/>\n&gt;still lets you revert to the older way of testing if your needs fall in the<br/>\n&gt;other 10%.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>For me, it&#39;s just a matter of how well you can use your tests as <br/>\ndocumentation. If you look at the test you don&#39;t know which call is <br/>\nsupposed to throw the exception. I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s just my style or <br/>\nnot, but I do often have that situation.. I call a method several times <br/>\nand only one call is supposed to throw. Sigh.. if only we had closures.<br/>\n<br/>\nMichael Feathers<br/>\nmichaelfeathers.typepad.com<br/>\nwww.objectmentor.com</div>",
