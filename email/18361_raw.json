So if you find that my code doesn&#39;t\nmake sense it&#39;s probably because it doesn&#39;t :). I just wanted to show the\naporoach.\n\nAnd remeber there are many ways to skin a cat so if my way does not suit\nyour needs adopt someone elses.\nAbout black-boxing/whiteboxing there are different levels of that. I think\nunittests are generally on the whiter shade of the scale although some would\nsay my tests are too white; I hope those people post their aproach so that\nyou can compare and pick what works for you. My constant advice to myself is\n&quot;if it&#39;s hard I&#39;m doing something wrong&quot;. Sometimes that leads me to change\nmy design, sometimes it leadds me to change the way I test. Experiment,\npractice and look how others do it. I can recomend reading the TDD list\naswell, lots of good stuff posted there.\n\nGood luck!\n/Joakim Ohlrogge\n\nOn 11/14/06, avinash anand &lt;avinash_anand@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;   Hi Joakim\n&gt; Your suggestion was very helpful to me. I was missing the base line while\n&gt; testing. I was trying to test and compare the code with something which was\n&gt; not known to me. May be I was trying to hit the problem in a black box way.\n&gt; I have gone through your sample code snippets send to me and I will try to\n&gt; break the code in such a way so that I can test it by comparing to some\n&gt; known values. That will I guess provide me with better stats !!\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks a Lot for your kind help\n&gt;\n&gt; -Avinash\n&gt;\n&gt; ----- Original Message ----\n&gt; From: Joakim Ohlrogge &lt;joakim.ohlrogge@...&lt;joakim.ohlrogge%40gmail.com&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; To: junit@yahoogroups.com &lt;junit%40yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; Sent: Tuesday, 14 November, 2006 6:01:36 PM\n&gt; Subject: Re: [junit] Promlem in writing Test case\n&gt;\n&gt; To me it sounds like the first thing you need to do is take control of\n&gt; your\n&gt; environment from your tests.\n&gt; From what you wrote below maybe I would do something like this:\n&gt;\n&gt; public TestVersionCalculat or extends TestCase {\n&gt;\n&gt; public testCalculatorVersi onIsNewer_ ReturnsZero( ) {\n&gt; VersionCalculator calculator = new VersionCalculator( &quot;7.1.1&quot;);\n&gt; AssertEquals( &quot;0&quot;, calculator.calculat e(&quot;7.0.1&quot; ));\n&gt; }\n&gt;\n&gt; public testCalculatorVersi onOlder_ReturnsN ewest() {\n&gt; VersionCalculator calculator = new VersionCalculator( &quot;6.1.5&quot;);\n&gt; AssertEquals( &quot;&quot;7.1.0&quot;&quot; , calculator.calculat e(&quot;7.1.0&quot; ));\n&gt; }\n&gt; }\n&gt;\n&gt; When that works I would maybe write a test for something that can read the\n&gt; XML so that if the XML contains a specific version I know that particular\n&gt; version would be returned:\n&gt;\n&gt; public void TestXmlVersionReade r extends TestCase {\n&gt; public testReadsVersionFro mReader() {\n&gt; Reader xmlInput = new StringReader( &quot;&lt;?xml version=&#39;1.0&#39; &#39;&gt;&lt;version&gt;\n&gt; 7.0.1&lt;/version&gt; &quot;) ;\n&gt; VersionReader versionReader = new XmlVersionReader( xmlInput) ;\n&gt; AssertEquals( &quot;7.0.1&quot;, versionReader. readVersion( ));\n&gt; }\n&gt;\n&gt; public testReadsVersionFro mReader() {\n&gt; Reader xmlInput = new StringReader( &quot;&lt;?xml version=&#39;1.0&#39; &#39;&gt;&lt;version&gt;\n&gt; 6.0.5&lt;/version&gt; &quot;) ;\n&gt; VersionReader versionReader = new XmlVersionReader( xmlInput) ;\n&gt; AssertEquals( &quot;6.0.5&quot;, versionReader. readVersion( ));\n&gt; }\n&gt; }\n&gt;\n&gt; When that works you have something that can read a version from your xml\n&gt; and\n&gt; something that can calculate a version.\n&gt; Now I would maybe revisit the first test again:\n&gt;\n&gt; public TestVersionCalculat or extends TestCase {\n&gt;\n&gt; public testCalculatorVersi onIsNewer_ ReturnsZero( ) {\n&gt;\n&gt; VersionCalculator calculator = new VersionCalculator( &quot;7.1.1&quot;,\n&gt;\n&gt; new VersionReader( ) {\n&gt;\n&gt; public String readVersion( ) {\n&gt;\n&gt; return &quot;7.0.1&quot;;\n&gt;\n&gt; }\n&gt;\n&gt; });\n&gt; AssertEquals( &quot;0&quot;, calculator.calculat e());\n&gt; }\n&gt;\n&gt; public testCalculatorVersi onOlder_ReturnsN ewest() {\n&gt; VersionCalculator calculator = new VersionCalculator( &quot;6.1.5&quot;,\n&gt;\n&gt; new VersionReader( ) {\n&gt;\n&gt; public String readVersion( ) {\n&gt;\n&gt; return &quot;7.1.0&quot;;\n&gt;\n&gt; }\n&gt;\n&gt; });\n&gt; AssertEquals( &quot;&quot;7.1.0&quot;&quot; , calculator.calculat e());\n&gt; }\n&gt; }\n&gt;\n&gt; That is just a simple example, where you start and the order things are\n&gt; implemented is unimportant. The important thing is to identify\n&gt; responsibilities and test them so that you are sure that they work. Some\n&gt; prefer to test larger chunks at the time, attack the problem from a\n&gt; different direction and so on, that is ok too. The bottom line is that you\n&gt; have to have a /known/ in your test. You have to know what the conditions\n&gt; are and how your system should behave with those conditions. Otherwise the\n&gt; test will have to run the same code as the code that is tested which, as\n&gt; you\n&gt; say, provides no value.\n&gt;\n&gt; I think you do know what to expect, there must be some rule, after all you\n&gt; knew how to write the code. I think the problem you are facing is that you\n&gt; maybe want to run the tests in an environment that you don&#39;t control. Why\n&gt; do\n&gt; you want to do that? What is the gain?.\n&gt; If you take control of your environment the testing is simple and consists\n&gt; of figuring out how to force your system into situations in which you can\n&gt; be\n&gt; sure how it should respond and have enough of those situations so you can\n&gt; be\n&gt; sure that your system works. The real gain is when you can write those\n&gt; tests\n&gt; as you develop the code and be able to listen to your tests so that they\n&gt; can\n&gt; contribute back to your design.\n&gt;\n&gt; Does that make sense or am I completely missing something about what you\n&gt; are\n&gt; trying to do?\n&gt;\n&gt; On 11/14/06, avinash anand &lt;avinash_anand@ yahoo.co. uk&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Hi Shane\n&gt; &gt; This here is something different. I want to testh this code in a dynamic\n&gt; &gt; enviroment, meaning the system will be feed with different xml files\n&gt; using\n&gt; &gt; diffrent permutation and combination. For instance if the current\n&gt; version\n&gt; &gt; installed is 7.1.1 and the xml file feed has a version 7.0.1 the code\n&gt; will\n&gt; &gt; return 0, if the current version is 6.1.5 and the xml file reads 7.1.0the\n&gt; &gt; code will return 7.1.0 Hence I will never be sure of the expected\n&gt; result.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Is there any other way to test the code sent earlier,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; 1. In term of usability\n&gt; &gt; 2. In term of testing exception\n&gt; &gt; 3. In term of results\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Thanks\n&gt; &gt; Aviansh\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ----- Original Message ----\n&gt; &gt; From: Shane Mingins &lt;shane.mingins@ gmail.com &lt;shane.mingins%\n&gt; 40gmail.com&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; To: junit@yahoogroups. com &lt;junit%40yahoogroup s.com&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Sent: Tuesday, 14 November, 2006 1:50:06 PM\n&gt; &gt; Subject: Re: [junit] Promlem in writing Test case\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; On 11/14/06, avinash anand &lt;avinash_anand@ yahoo.co. uk&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Hi All\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I am writing a test case in JUnit. The original class GetInfo.java has\n&gt; a\n&gt; &gt; method. String getSystemVersion( String str) which is under test. This\n&gt; &gt; method is supplied with path variable in form of string from where it\n&gt; reads\n&gt; &gt; a xml file to get certain data and return back to the user.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; The point of confussion for me is to how to test the method. What\n&gt; should\n&gt; &gt; be the actual and expected result. Meaning for getting the expected\n&gt; result I\n&gt; &gt; will have to use the same logic as it is in the main code, if I use the\n&gt; same\n&gt; &gt; logic to read the xml file then the assert statement would not be\n&gt; meaningful\n&gt; &gt; as then the expected and actual results would be same.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I am not sure why you have to use the same logic to calculate the\n&gt; &gt; expected result?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; You have an xml file that u will use for the test (I personally might\n&gt; &gt; do something different) in which you know what version you expect back\n&gt; &gt; ... so you code assert_equals( 0,\n&gt; &gt; getinfo.getSystemVe rsion(fileToRetu rnZero)) etc.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; cheers\n&gt; &gt; shane\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Send instant messages to your online friends http://uk.messenger.yahoo.com\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt;\n&gt; Send instant messages to your online friends http://uk.messenger.yahoo.com\n&gt;\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n",
