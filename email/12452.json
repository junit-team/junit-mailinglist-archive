If the code is written in a proper IoC style, it should be able <br/>\nto be hooked up easily without the context. On the other hand, when you <br/>\nget to integration style tests where a number of classes are working <br/>\ntogether, using a context may make things easier.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat works pretty nicely in this case too is to combine multiple xml fragments to make up the context, with the tests mixing different fragments than the production use, so that you can do things like using a different DataSource than you would in the real container.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, take a look at the helper classes here:<br/>\n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.springframework.org/docs/api/org/springframework/test/package-summary.html\">http://www.springframework.org/docs/api/org/springframework/test/package-summary.html</a><br/>\nthey can save some decent amount of work... These classes are available as part of the spring-mock.jar.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nColin<br/>\n(core Spring developer)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nTambascio, Larry wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;I think you could do either.  Using Spring for tests may require a different<br/>\n&gt;context for unit tests, perhaps.  But there&#39;s nothing wrong with manually<br/>\n&gt;setting up your class using the new operator.  The risk is in the<br/>\n&gt;duplication (in your tests, are you setting it up exactly as Spring will?).<br/>\n&gt;I&#39;d probably start with using new, and if things start to get complex, then<br/>\n&gt;figure out how to use Spring (which isn&#39;t that hard I believe).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;-Larry <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;-----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt;From: Yagiz Erkan [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:yagizerkan@...\">yagizerkan@...</a>] <br/>\n&gt;Sent: Friday, December 10, 2004 11:50 AM<br/>\n&gt;To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt;Subject: [junit] Testing object instantiated by Spring<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Hi all,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I&#39;m testing a class that Spring creates an instance for me at runtime<br/>\n&gt;(and my code is using it through the interface type) therefore I never<br/>\n&gt;do &quot;new MyClass()&quot; in the production code. In the programmer tests,<br/>\n&gt;would you use the same method of creating the concrete class or would<br/>\n&gt;you call new MyClass() to keep it simple?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Thanks,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;- Yagiz Erkan -<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://yagiz.blogspot.com\">http://yagiz.blogspot.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.erkans.com\">http://www.erkans.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;Yahoo!
