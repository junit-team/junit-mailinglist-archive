They all have the same \n&gt; structure:\n&gt; 1. Create some test files and directories in an directory called &quot;source&quot;\n&gt; 2. Start the backup process (to backup the files/dirs in &quot;source&quot; to a \n&gt; directory called &quot;target&quot;)\n&gt; 3. Check whether all files in &quot;source&quot; exist also in &quot;target&quot;\n&gt; 4. Remove all files from the &quot;source&quot; and &quot;target&quot; directory so that the \n&gt; directories are empty for the next test.\nIs there any need to share a &#39;static&#39; directory across tests at all?\nMay I suggest establishing a separate location for each test would\nensure they don&#39;t ever clash, perhaps include the test name in the\nfolder naming?\n\nIf at some point in the future your tests are run in parallel, distinct\ntesting folders would support this.\n\nI suspect you have a timing issue or race conditions, so I would try and\navoid any clashes and  aim to build a set of completely isolated tests.\n\n-- \nMark\n\n",
