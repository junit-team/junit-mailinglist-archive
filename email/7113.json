To do that, I have to manage <br/>\nchange, rather than resist it. So it is with the code itself.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is true that progress slows in the face of change, but only if <br/>\nthere is not an effective way to manage change. Tests are the safety <br/>\nnet that help us manage the risk of changing code; therefore, in the <br/>\npresence of tests, change should be simple, even if not easy. In <br/>\nother words, the tests enable refactoring, which enable us to adapt <br/>\nto the changing needs of our customers.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow it is also true that interfaces should converge to stability <br/>\nover time; but forcing them to do so ignores important information. <br/>\nThere must be a reason why this natural convergence does not happen <br/>\nin a given situation. Therein, perhaps, lies a problem that we need <br/>\nto solve. Rather than ignore the problem or steamroller over it, we <br/>\nshould examine it and deal with it.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- JBR.</div>",
