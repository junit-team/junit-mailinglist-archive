We extended \nJunit to be feed runtime parameters and test data variables by an XML \nfile.  We use this extensively and it really helps so we don&#39;t have \nto hard code test data into our TestCase classes--we just call \ngetTestVariable(String name) which is in the parent of all of our \nTestCases.  And the second thing I just put in, but we are not really \nusing much yet--I added variables to the XML file to set a SQL script \nand refresh flag to run the script against the database either once \nfor the entire TestSuite or before each Test in the Suite.\n\nI am new to the group if anybody is interested in the code let me \nknow how to post it.\n\nThanks,\nPete Gordon\n\n\n\n\n--- In junit@y..., Jim Cheesman &lt;jchees@m...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; At 07:02 PM 4/25/2001, you wrote:\n&gt; &gt;I have played with junit and also written crude testing frameworks.\n&gt; &gt;I am currently working with a project that interfaces with PVCS \nVersion\n&gt; &gt;Manager.\n&gt; &gt;When I run my test, I try to checkout/check in files, but whenever \nI run my\n&gt; &gt;test suite\n&gt; &gt;I need to delete all the subfolders and copy them from a backup so \nI can be\n&gt; &gt;in a known state\n&gt; &gt;I also have to have the user check in version manager if the file \nactually\n&gt; &gt;got checkedin/checkout\n&gt; \n&gt; You could use ant (http://jakarta.apache.org) to do the check \nin/out \n&gt; procedure - one of its built-in tasks is Cvs. As for setting up the \ndata, \n&gt; simple tasks like copying test data to/from directories, cleaning \n&gt; directories etc. is also easy to setup. (I haven&#39;t used the cvs \ntask - we \n&gt; have Source Safe here, but I don&#39;t suppose that it&#39;s too difficult \nto set up.)\n&gt; \n&gt; If you&#39;re using a database, as you almost certainly are, things get \nmore \n&gt; complicated ;) Some possible options:\n&gt; * Someone here (I forget who) posted a &quot;MockResultSet&quot; class that \ncan be \n&gt; used to fake database results - I think it&#39;s available on the Yahoo \ngroups \n&gt; web page somewhere.\n&gt; * You could set up a script (also executed by ant?) that creates \nsome fake \n&gt; tables in your database and populates them with data, which you \ncould then \n&gt; test against. (You have got a test database, right?) Once the tests \nhave \n&gt; been run, you could then execute a seperate script to clean up.\n&gt; \n&gt; If anyone has any other suggestions I&#39;d love to hear them - this is \na \n&gt; problem that I&#39;ve come up against more than once...\n&gt; \n&gt; (If you decide to use ant, and are not sure how to use it, feel \nfree to \n&gt; mail me).\n&gt; \n&gt; HTH,\n&gt; Jim\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --\n&gt; \n&gt;                            *   Jim Cheesman   *\n&gt;              Trabajo: \n&gt; jchees@m... - (34)(91) 724 9200 x 2360\n&gt;                Personal: \n&gt; mogrim@a...
