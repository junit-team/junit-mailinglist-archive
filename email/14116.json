I was brainstorming and idea on the drive home from work tonight<br/>\n&gt; and realized I didn&#39;t know how to test something. This didn&#39;t come as<br/>\n&gt; a major shock, but I think I have an idea for a solution and I would<br/>\n&gt; like some devil&#39;s advocates :)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Suppose the following class:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; public class SomeClass {<br/>\n&gt;    public boolean doSomething(double x, double y) {<br/>\n&gt;       double a = Math.random();<br/>\n&gt;       double b = Math.random();<br/>\n&gt;       return (x+a) &gt; (y+b);<br/>\n&gt;    }<br/>\n&gt; }<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Writing a test case for this is next to impossible because you do not<br/>\n&gt; know the results of the method beforehand. But what if there were an<br/>\n&gt; interface:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; public interface DoubleGenerator { public double nextDouble(); }<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; that SomeClass depends on.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; public class SomeClass {<br/>\n&gt;    private DoubleGenerator doubleGenerator;<br/>\n&gt;    //setter method<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;    public boolean doSomething(double x, double y) {<br/>\n&gt;       double a = doubleGenerator.nextDouble();<br/>\n&gt;       double b = doubleGenerator.nextDouble();<br/>\n&gt;       return (x+a) &gt; (y+b);<br/>\n&gt;    }<br/>\n&gt; }<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The implementation of DoubleGenerator in production code could be a<br/>\n&gt; wrapper around Math.random() and a testing implementation could allow<br/>\n&gt; you to set the sequence of doubles to return.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; You could also use java.util.Random instead of DoubleGenerator and<br/>\n&gt; subclass it to allow setting of the sequence, but I don&#39;t like having<br/>\n&gt; all the extra methods when SomeClass only needs one of them. However,<br/>\n&gt; having the extra methods allows for flexibility later. Opinions?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>There is exactly what we do to test behavior that uses randomness: we <br/>\nhide the ugly randomness behind an interface, then generate fixed <br/>\nsequences of data in tests and use the random implementation in production.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Also, is setting a DoubleGenerator with two doubles good practice? For<br/>\n&gt; now, doSomething() needs two doubles, but it may need three or four<br/>\n&gt; later. Is this &quot;inside knowledge&quot; bad practice when writing tests?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>If you think it might need 3 or 4, then it should probably take a <br/>\ncollection of some kind. This is perfectly good practice in tests.<br/>\n<br/>\nI find it nice when I independently discover something that is already <br/>\nestablished practice. It tells me I&#39;m on a good path.<br/>\n<br/>\nTake care.<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJ. B.
