    "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-410746184\">My problem is usually along the lines of: I make changes to classA, which is used in classB, which is used in classC, which is tested by testC.  So, I have modified testA, which directly tests classA, but don&#39;t realize that I have broken something in testC.  My solution is that we run nightlybuilds, and I check the errors/failures the next morning to see if my code changes could have caused any of them.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt would be nice to be a little more proactive, though,...being able to (easily) find all the tests that are ultimately affected by my code change (iterating through the workspace references until I terminate at all classes that start with &quot;Test&quot;, or that are in my test branch).  I know that I can do this manually through Eclipse, but it is not fun - and therefore doesn&#39;t get done.<br/>\n<br/>\n-------------- Original message -------------- <br/>\nEveryone:<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve heard for years people talking about the importance of being able <br/>\nto find all the tests for a given class. I have never cared about this, <br/>\nso I&#39;m surprised when so many other people do care about it. Either <br/>\nthey&#39;re missing something simple, or I&#39;m missing something simple.<br/>\n<br/>\nLet&#39;s say I want to know which tests cover a given production code <br/>\nmethod. To do that, I go to the method, then hit Shift+Ctrl+G in <br/>\nEclipse, searching the workspace for references to that method. It&#39;s <br/>\nusually pretty easy to scan the list of search results and separate the <br/>\ntest case classes (which have the word &quot;Test&quot; in them) from the <br/>\nproduction code classes (which don&#39;t have the word &quot;Test&quot; in them). This <br/>\ntechnique has never posed a serious enough problem for me to want to do <br/>\nit a different way.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have used the same technique with IntelliJ IDEA, so it&#39;s not just an <br/>\nEclipse thing.<br/>\n<br/>\nI can also do the same thing if I want to see which tests use the <br/>\n/class/, but I can&#39;t remember the last time I wanted to know that. I <br/>\ntypically want to know which tests are using a /method/, not a class.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo would anyone like to tell us a story of when they needed to search <br/>\nfor the tests that cover a given production code class, and how <br/>\norganizing their tests their way made that easy? I&#39;d like to learn what <br/>\nthe big issues are.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks.<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJ. B.
