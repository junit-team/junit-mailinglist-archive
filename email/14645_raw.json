And in my experience, that&#39;s very likely\n&gt;&gt; always possible, in a way that makes the design more flexible and\n&gt;&gt; the behaviour more reusable. \n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Does that sound reasonable?\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Let us redefine progress, to mean that just because we /can/\n&gt; do a thing, it does not necessarily follow that we /must/ do\n&gt; that thing.&quot; So I suppose it would depend on several factors.\n&gt; \n&gt; 1. Are you doing this /just/ so that you can test the method\n&gt; by external invocation? If so then my answer is no. 2. Is the\n&gt; method already tested through the public API of the class? If\n&gt; yes then my answer is no. 3. Does the system (code plus\n&gt; tests) clearly communicate everything that needs to be\n&gt; communicated at this time? If it does then my answer is no.\n&gt; 4. Is the flexibility and reusability that you refer to\n&gt; needed now or is it speculative? If the latter then my answer\n&gt; is no. 5. Was my answer no to the previous questions and\n&gt; there are more stories needing to be implemented this iteration? Then\n&gt; heck no! \n\nI&#39;m not doing this &quot;just&quot; for one thing. In my experience moving a complex\nmethod to a place where it wants to be public both\n\n- makes the code more expressive,\n- makes the code easier to test,\n- makes the code more flexible, and thereby\n- helps me to maintain a high velocity.\n\nAlso keep in mind that moving the method often is only a first step, an\nenabler for further simplifying refactorings.\n\nCheers, Ilja\n\n\n",
