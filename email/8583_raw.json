However, I disagree with the statement - unle=\r\nss\n&gt;you got something other than your own experience to back that statement=\r\n up\n&gt;with.\n\nYou disagree with what part: that it&#39;s a time waster or that it=\r\n&#39;s a &quot;top time waster&quot;?\n\nAs for &quot;something other than your own experience t=\r\no back that statement up with&quot;, what on Earth is more important than one&#39;s =\r\nexperience?\n\n&gt;&gt; PS: Yes, I&#39;ve worked on a project where no external \n&gt;&gt; doc=\r\numentation was required. When a new employee came on board \n&gt;&gt; and began wo=\r\nrking with the code, he said, &quot;This code is so \n&gt;&gt; easy to read, I already =\r\nunderstand what&#39;s going on.&quot; Since I \n&gt;&gt; also benefited from the easy-to-re=\r\nad code while I was \n&gt;&gt; building the system, the effort I put into making t=\r\nhe code \n&gt;&gt; self-documenting was well worth it. In other words, if the \n&gt;&gt; =\r\ncode tells the story, then that is often enough.\n&gt;\n&gt;This paragraph I really=\r\n disagree with.\n\nSince I documented my personal experience in this paragrap=\r\nh, I scarcely understand how you can disagree with it. How does one &quot;disagr=\r\nee&quot; with experience? Is that even defined?\n\nNow if you disagree with the fi=\r\nnal statement, then do you have something other than your own experience to=\r\n back that statement up with?\n\n&gt; I have walked into far too many\n&gt;shops whe=\r\nre the programmers produced code that they thought was easy to\n&gt;read, but i=\r\nn fact wasn&#39;t. Just because it is &quot;clear code&quot; to you and\n&gt;possibly your te=\r\nam - doesn&#39;t mean that it will be looked upon as &quot;clear\n&gt;code&quot; by the peopl=\r\ne that follow you.\n\nThere are certain objective measures of code clarity. Y=\r\nou cannot possibly argue that clarity is *entirely* subjective. We can even=\r\n define clarity in terms of clarity to the general population, as opposed t=\r\no clarity to an individual, if you like.\n\n&gt;      Frankly having a new emplo=\r\nyee walk in the door and comment how &quot;easy\n&gt;the code is too read&quot; isn&#39;t tha=\r\nt amazing or even points to the fact that\n&gt;the code is in fact easy to read=\r\n. He they know you favor &quot;easy to ready\n&gt;code&quot; they might have been just sa=\r\nying that to get a positive response or\n&gt;to push up their own capabilities =\r\nin your eyes. \n\nObviously there is no way for me to know whether this is th=\r\ne case; however, I have never seen anyone make that comment -- about anyone=\r\n&#39;s code -- before or since, so I cannot believe that it is a common way for=\r\n new employees to suck up to the old. I have not seen programmers suck up t=\r\no one another at all -- it seems like a pretty stupid thing to do.\n\n&gt;Sure, =\r\nyour code could in\n&gt;fact be the most readable code in existence, but a new =\r\nemployee pushing a\n&gt;positive response is not a good indicator - its simply =\r\nhuman nature.\n\nYou sound like you have specific experience in this directio=\r\nn, so nothing I can say would persuade you one way or the other. Our experi=\r\nences differ.\n\n----------\n\nGetting back to the point, though, (objectively)=\r\n clear code beats (redundant) documentation. I think we can agree with that=\r\n. We may disagree on the likelihood of producing objectively clear code, bu=\r\nt I think we can agree that documentation ought to supplement code, and not=\r\n just explain it. Code ought to be able to explain itself. The code is the =\r\nmost accurate record of what the code does, after all.\n\nI simply believe th=\r\nat documentation should be one level of abstraction higher than code; other=\r\nwise, the reader should read the code. Of course, if the team needs documen=\r\ntation to fill a void, then it should build that documentation; but I would=\r\nn&#39;t build it until that need was felt. That&#39;s all I&#39;m trying to say here.\n\n=\r\nTake care.\n\n\nJ. B.
