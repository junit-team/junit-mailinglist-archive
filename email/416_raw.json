Over the next few weeks\nI&#39;ll be posting several of them for the benefit of anyone else who wants to\nuse them.  I would love to hear any feedback you have to give.\n\nA common problem in testing a distributed system is interacting with\nasynchronous services.  For example, suppose you want to test that an email\nmessage gets sent correctly, so you set up a local mailbox to test with.\nYou write a test case that should cause a message to be sent.  But if you\ncheck that mailbox immediately after sending, your test is bound to fail.\n\nWhat everyone I&#39;ve seen does is to tell their test case to go to sleep for\nsome hardcoded length of time before checking.  But as conditions may vary\nin multiple testing environments, this interval will have to cover even the\nslowest possible case in order to avoid false negatives--and then everyone\nsuffers the delay.\n\nWhat I think these test developers would really like to do is use a\nRetriedAssert!  Example:\n\n     new RetriedAssert(5000, 250) { // timeout, interval\n         public void run() throws Exception {\n             doSomeStuff();\n             assert(someCondition);\n         }\n     }.start();\n\nYou&#39;re free to muck it up however you wish, and there&#39;s a few test cases to\ntell you if you mucked it up too much.  :-)\n\n &lt;&lt;RetriedAssert.java&gt;&gt;  &lt;&lt;RetriedAssertTest.java&gt;&gt; \nKevin\n\nP.S.
