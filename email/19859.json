I understand you are<br/>\n&gt;  &gt;  currently doing this as an exercise, so it&#39;s healthy to take it to<br/>\n&gt;  &gt;  extremes and do everything by the book in order to learn, but in your<br/>\n&gt;  &gt;  real work, use your judgment and decide for yourself when you are<br/>\n&gt;  &gt;  indeed writing too much code, in which case it&#39;s probably safer to go<br/>\n&gt;  &gt;  the usual route (get your code to work, then write tests for it).<br/>\n&gt;  &gt;<br/>\n&gt;  &gt;  The downside of TDD is that you can end up writing a lot of tests for<br/>\n&gt;  &gt;  business code that you quickly throw away and rewrite, so the amount<br/>\n&gt;  &gt;  of churn can be quite high.<br/>\n&gt;  &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  I disagree. When I&#39;ve found something difficult to write test first<br/>\n&gt;  I&#39;ve always done a spike, then delete the code and rewrote it test<br/>\n&gt;  first. I&#39;ve always found the result to be a lot more cleaner,<br/>\n&gt;  especially since I wind up cleaning up the code anyway when I used to<br/>\n&gt;  write tests around them.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  I&#39;d rather have my business code tested rather than not test it under<br/>\n&gt;  the assumption it will one day be thrown away. ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, I never suggested not writing tests, I was just saying that<br/>\nsometimes, it&#39;s okay to write your tests once you&#39;re done with the<br/>\nbusiness code.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere is a scenario I&#39;ve seen happen fairly often:<br/>\n<br/>\nWrite test1<br/>\nWrite code1<br/>\nWrite test2<br/>\nWrite code2<br/>\n<br/>\nThen a refactoring comes to mind and you realize you don&#39;t need code1<br/>\nand code2 any more, so you write code3, and suddenly, you find<br/>\nyourself having to refactor (or throw away) both test1 and test2.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was simply suggesting that sometimes, the following flow works better:<br/>\n<br/>\nWrite code1<br/>\nWrite code2<br/>\n&lt;realize a refactoring is possible&gt;<br/>\nRefactor code1/code2 into code3<br/>\n&lt;happy with the result, now we write the test&gt;<br/>\nWrite test3<br/>\n<br/>\nNet result:  two less tests to write.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nCédric<br/>\nAuthor &quot;Next Generation Testing in Java&quot; (<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://tinyurl.com/yvyxa3)\">http://tinyurl.com/yvyxa3)</a> </span></blockquote></div>",
