It&#39;s a shame really, and I hope to help <br/>\nchange that mentality.  One of my tactics in doing so, as you well know, <br/>\nis to convince readers that testing is also a design activity.  As such, <br/>\nI should be able to change any phrase about testing into a phrase about <br/>\ndesign.  It&#39;s something I&#39;ve been practicing, and this title is one <br/>\nattempt.     <br/>\n<br/>\nNow, please write that article!  :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nMike<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nMike Clark<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://clarkware.com\">http://clarkware.com</a><br/>\n(720) 851-2014</div>",
