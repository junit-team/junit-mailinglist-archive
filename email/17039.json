I need more information:<br/>\nAre you using WSAD or RAD (or what IDE, if any).<br/>\nWhich version of WAS are you trying to hit, 5.0, 5.1, 6.0, 6.1<br/>\nBecause what you include will vary depending.<br/>\n <br/>\nIf you happen to be using RAD and WSAD 5.1, here&#39;s what you&#39;ll need:<br/>\nThe attached implfactory.jar (taken from one of the JAR files that ships with WebSphere, you can get this from your distribution instead of using the attached file).<br/>\nInclude a file called jndi.properties in your class path that has the following 2 entries:<br/>\n<br/>\njava.naming.factory.initial=com.sun.jndi.cosnaming.CNCtxFactory<br/>\njava.naming.provider.url=iiop://localhost:2809<br/>\nWhenever you search for an EJB home outside of a container, add the following to your lookup path:<br/>\ncell/nodes/localhost/servers/server1/<br/>\nNote, your values might be different. You&#39;ll have to run the universal test client and manually expand the JNDI tree to make sure your EJB home objects are registered there.<br/>\nTutorials and Articles<br/>\n     http://schuchert.wikispaces.com/<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n----- Original Message ----<br/>\nFrom: swetha yalamanchili &lt;sb_syalamanchili@...&gt;<br/>\nTo: junit@yahoogroups.com<br/>\nSent: Monday, June 26, 2006 5:20:48 AM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [junit] can junit test ejb&#39;s without junit extensions<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHi Brett,<br/>\n<br/>\nCan you please tell me the list of jar files which need to be placed in the classpath.<br/>\nAs welll as the properties necessary.<br/>\n<br/>\nThank You,<br/>\nSwetha<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Brett L. Schuchert&quot; &lt;schuchert@yahoo. com&gt; wrote:<br/>\nYes. We&#39;ve been doing it for 3+ years.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe key is getting the right combination of jar files and property files in your class path. Once you&#39;ve done that, you can connect to an EJB and send it a message. No problem.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, I&#39;d caution you to not do that if you can avoid it. <br/>\n<br/>\nI understand that you are testing the use of the code more closely to the environment in which it will run. On the other hand, you now will need to run a server to run your unit tests. They will be a bit more of a pain to debug (though they are certainly debug-able).<br/>\n<br/>\nWe are using stateful session beans (I can give you the reasons for it if you&#39;d like, but suffice it to say we are doing that). We then introduce entity beans because, frankly, WebSphere&#39;s handling of stateful session beans was wholly inadequate (and I can explain that - this was for WAS 5.0 - 5.1, have not experimented with WAS 6.0 or 6.1 yet). Since we started using entity beans, we started using server side tests. Now we have a whole lot of tests that require a server. <br/>\n<br/>\nWell we&#39;re moving away from that. We&#39;re replacing all of our entity beans (about 6 coarse-grained beans) with hibernate. We are moving all logic out of stateful session beans into POJO&#39;s so the session beans are just pass through. Then we&#39;ll use spring to configure the system.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis allows for quick testing without having to have a server running (better support for continuous integration only because it removes an excuse for people to check in without running all unit tests - not really a good reason but it can help). ALSO, if you move to WAS 6.0 and RAD 6.0, deployment can be VERY slow (up to 15 minutes and beyond for a moderate system), which makes testing even more of a pain BUT NO LESS ESSENTIAL.<br/>\n<br/>\nI understand that to be pragmatic you probably need a solution now and might consider allowing tests to run without having to use a server.<br/>\n<br/>\nI won&#39;t be able to get back to you with any details until next week (I&#39;m about to leave on a vacation). But if you send me the following information, I&#39;ll try to give you the details that might get you there:<br/>\n- Version of WAS<br/>\n- Your IDE, if any (WSAD, RAD, Eclipse + WTP, ...) and the version number of that IDE<br/>\n<br/>\nAs an alternative, you can try this right now:<br/>\n1. Start a server.<br/>\n2. Run the universal test client to look at the JNDI tree<br/>\n3. Find where your beans are actually deployed: cell/nodes/server/ server1/. .. (or something like that, don&#39;t have the info handy)<br/>\n4. Use Sun&#39;s JNDI instead of IBM&#39;s<br/>\n5. Point to the correct port, 2809 for WAS 5.1, 2810 for WAS 6.x<br/>\n6. If you are looking for a session bean called FooHome, add cell/nodes/server/ server1/ in front of it.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope that&#39;s enough to get you started. I can get more to you next week.<br/>\n<br/>\nEmail me direct, please, at schuchert@yahoo. com<br/>\n<br/>\nTutorials and Articles<br/>\nhttp://schuchert. wikispaces. com/<br/>\n<br/>\n----- Original Message ----<br/>\nFrom: swetha yalamanchili &lt;sb_syalamanchili@ yahoo.com&gt;<br/>\nTo: junit@yahoogroups. com<br/>\nSent: Thursday, June 22, 2006 10:42:41 AM<br/>\nSubject: [junit] can junit test ejb&#39;s without junit extensions<br/>\n<br/>\nHi Rain,<br/>\n<br/>\nI have few questions.<br/>\nCan junit test ejb&#39;s without any sort of extensions like cactus or junitee or etc.<br/>\nCan JUnit test Ejb&#39;s on IBMWebsphere.<br/>\n<br/>\nplease help<br/>\n<br/>\n------------ --------- --------- ---<br/>\nSneak preview the all-new Yahoo.com.
