The number of classes I&#39;d like\nto test this way is quite large.  I think having lots of different test\nsuites would quickly become unmanageable.\n\nIf I need to build this capability myself, would building my own custom\nRunner be the right approach?  If so, is there some documentation on how\nto write a custom Runner?  Or do I just need to read the code?\n\n\nyme0987654321 wrote on 12/10/2009 08:23 PM:\n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; The way I would handle this is to inject the relevant properties via a \n&gt; properties object, and then in production pass System.getProperties(), \n&gt; that way the tests are not coupled to the nasty global which is the \n&gt; System property.\n&gt; \n&gt; If that isn&#39;t an option for some reason, perhaps you can organize your \n&gt; different tests into suites, and set the system property in a \n&gt; @BeforeClass method on the suite?\n&gt; \n&gt; Yishai\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In junit@yahoogroups.com &lt;mailto:junit%40yahoogroups.com&gt;, Bill \n&gt; Shannon &lt;Bill.Shannon@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; I&#39;ve read the FAQ and the javadocs and done much web searching but \n&gt; can&#39;t find\n&gt;  &gt; an answer to this. Sorry if this is stupid question.\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; I need to write a test case that tests a class whose behavior depends on\n&gt;  &gt; a System property. The class reads the System property at class \n&gt; initialization\n&gt;  &gt; time. I&#39;d like to have multiple test cases, each of which sets a \n&gt; different\n&gt;  &gt; value for the System property, so each of the tests needs to be run in a\n&gt;  &gt; separate JVM or possibly a separate ClassLoader.\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; Is there a simple way to (e.g.) annotate my test case to cause JUnit to\n&gt;  &gt; handle this for me?\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; I&#39;m invoking JUnit as part of a maven build. Note that I don&#39;t want to\n&gt;  &gt; run *all* of my JUnit tests in a single separate JVM, I want to run\n&gt;  &gt; certain test cases each in their own separate JVM (or ClassLoader).\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; If I have to start a new JVM or create a new ClassLoader myself, what&#39;s\n&gt;  &gt; the best way to initialize the CLASSPATH and find the class to be tested\n&gt;  &gt; from within a JUnit test case running under maven?\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; Thanks.\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n",
