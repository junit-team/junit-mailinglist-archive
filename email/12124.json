I agree with you <br/>\nthat it depends on the degree of oupling between methods. Also, I <br/>\nthink that the number of unit test cases will determine the effort <br/>\nrequired. <br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, can I come up with an estimate by making some assumptions. <br/>\nFor eg: the number of parameters required for each method to invoke. <br/>\n<br/>\nAt the granular level i.e per test case per method, is it possible to <br/>\ncome up with lines of code (LOC) for JUnit code. If so what are the <br/>\nparameters on which the LOC for a particular test case depends on. <br/>\nThis muct include teh mock classes also. <br/>\n<br/>\nAny help is appreciated. <br/>\n<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;J.
