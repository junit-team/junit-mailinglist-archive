Connections are &#39;clean&#39; when you put them back in the pool.\nThe next piece of code to use the connection should be able to\ndo so without fear of picking up a bad connection or one which\nwasn&#39;t tidied up properly by the last user.\n2. That when a connection is returned to the pool the code or module\nwhich returned it doesn&#39;t use it any more.\n\nIt&#39;s great if you can test for this in the pools but doing so may be\nas much a design issue as a testing one.\n\nGood luck.\nRob.\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: Peter Cullinan [mailto:Peter.Cullinan@...]\nSent: 22 June 2001 09:08\nTo: &#39;junit@yahoogroups.com&#39;\nSubject: [junit] Testing Connection Pools\n\n\nDear all\n\nI want to know what is the most efficient way of testing the connection\npools.  At the moment I am thinking of using Mike Clarkes JUnitPerf, is this\nthe correct road to go on.  And if it is then, has anybody got any tips to\nimplement the test.\n\nWhat are the most important things to test ?\n1) The time to get a connection from the pool is one of the trivial things I\nguess.\n2) Load testing.\n\nAny other good suggestions ?\nHow do I carry out the testing ?\n\nThanking you in anticipation of your response, kindest regards-\n\nPeter Cullinan, junior java software tester\n\n\nTo unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\njunit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n\n\nYour use of Yahoo!
