That&#39;s when I found the problem, namely, if I don&#39;t put the \nsource files into the same directory as the class files, it doesn&#39;t \nwork.  I was using the GUI testrunner for this, but was never quite \nsure what I was loading, so tried the Text textrunner, and now it \nappears that I have CLASSPATH problems (the old \nNoClassDefFoundError).  Thanks!\n--- In junit@yahoogroups.com, Jason Rogers &lt;jacaetevha@f...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; JUnit does not depend on source files.  You are probably using Ant \nor\n&gt; some other tool to start up JUnit.  The problem is most likely \nthere. \n&gt; Try it straight from the command line and see if you get different\n&gt; results.\n&gt; \n&gt; =jason\n&gt; \n&gt; On Wed, 2003-05-14 at 19:54, junitguy wrote:\n&gt; &gt; I keep my source files in a &quot;src&quot; directory.  When I build with \nAnt, \n&gt; &gt; I compile my class files into a &quot;build&quot; directory.  I would like \nto \n&gt; &gt; then run JUnit tests against the newly created classes in the \nbuild \n&gt; &gt; directory, but JUnit can&#39;t seem to do this unless the .java files \nare \n&gt; &gt; copied there as well.  I&#39;ve tried setting a classpath to both \n&gt; &gt; locations, but this does not solve the problem.  Someone have a \ngood \n&gt; &gt; solution to this problem?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; &gt; junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Your use of Yahoo!
