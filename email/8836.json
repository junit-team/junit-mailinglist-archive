(I mainly mock complex remote communication partners, e.g. <br/>\n&gt;  corba based proprietary servers, other proprietary servers with special<br/>\n&gt;  communication protocolls, DBs, ... . This works really good for me<br/>\n&gt;  and lets me tests lots of stuff in my unit tests)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I know; I&#39;ve been there. Now the pendulum has swung back and I&#39;m trying to use mocks as little as possible.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;- the code to be written is not complex<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>&quot;It&#39;s not that hard, so let&#39;s write it&quot;?! Just because adding complexity is easy doesn&#39;t make it a good idea!<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;- you cannot simply move the code in this case because the calls to exit<br/>\n&gt;  are scattered around, you would also have to replace the exit calls <br/>\n&gt;  with e.g. return SomeExitCode;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Scattered around where? Who the hell thought that was a good idea?!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nJ. B.
