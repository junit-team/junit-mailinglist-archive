You could read the principle of YAGNI as<br/>\n&gt; saying don&#39;t pay for the flexibility until you know you need it.  If I<br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t have any real reason to believe that I&#39;m likely to swap in a new<br/>\n&gt; algorithm later, then moving the algorithm into its own class could be<br/>\n&gt; seen as overkill.  (There are still, however, plenty of reasons to<br/>\n&gt; encapsulate it in its own method, like readability and coherence.)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Remember: YAGNI means you shouldn&#39;t invest in *functionality* you just don&#39;t<br/>\nneed for now; it shouldn&#39;t be used for excuses to not try to get the best<br/>\n(most readable/maintainable) design for the funtionality you just need.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Moving it into its own class does buy you something in simplifying the<br/>\n&gt; testing, though, so is that (up-front, immediate) benefit sufficient<br/>\n&gt; to justify the cost of the pattern?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>As you pointed out above, there may be other benefits. Test-first<br/>\nprogramming is not only a testing strategy, but also (if not mainly) a<br/>\ndesign strategy. If you find something hard to test, it *may* be an<br/>\nindicator that the design needs to be improved.<br/>\n<br/>\nciao, Ilja</div>",
