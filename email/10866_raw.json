To answer this:\n\n&gt;&gt; That would sort of imply that the databases behave the same way,\nbut I&#39;m not sure why that would be my direct concern.\n\nWe&#39;re migrating from an MS Access database to Oracle 8.1.7.  They use\ndifferent variants of the SQL Standard.  Specifically, Access allows &quot;LEFT\nJOIN&quot; and &quot;INNER JOIN&quot; syntax, while Oracle requires the &quot;(+)&quot; syntax.  We\nwant to test that all of the queries that were touched return the same,\nsometimes large, sets of results.  So, it seems like we need to run the\nqueries on each configuration or database and verify that the results are\nidentical, row for row, and in order.\n\n\n\n  -----Original Message-----\n  From: Brett Neumeier [mailto:random@...]\n  Sent: Thursday, April 15, 2004 11:40 AM\n  To: junit@yahoogroups.com\n  Subject: Re: [junit] Database testing puzzle\n\n\n  On Thu, 2004-04-15 at 11:14, Dave Bender wrote:\n  &gt; [..] But I&#39;m puzzled, then, about how to do testing to verify that the\n  &gt; results from the database interactions are identical since I have to\n  &gt; stop and start the application to switch databases.\n\n  I might be missing something, but what I would do is switch the database\n  that is being used during the tests, then run them and make sure that\n  all the tests pass.\n\n  That is to say, I&#39;m not so much interested in whether the results from\n  the database interactions are identical; I&#39;m mostly interested in making\n  sure that the results of using the app with Database A are correct,\n  andthat the results of using the app with Database B are correct as\n  well.

Would that work in your situation?\n\n  Cheers,\n\n  bn\n\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n--\n  Yahoo! Groups Links\n\n    a..
