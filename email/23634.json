I now<br/>\nbelieve that was mistakenly complex, given the size and agility that<br/>\nwe should be able to maintain.  So, I have simplified matters.  All<br/>\nnew pull requests, in general should go directly against<br/>\nKentBeck/master.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen it comes time to cut a release branch, I will introduce a new<br/>\nbranch with the release version number (i.e., 4.10).  The only pull<br/>\nrequests that should go against the release branch should be for<br/>\nregression bugs found during beta testing.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\n<br/>\n   David Saff</div>",
