You have obviously employed independent unit\ntesters after this expected point of convergence, which has helped make\nthis work for you. I&#39;m not sure about generalizing, though. That&#39;s just\na matter of opinion -- for each of us.\n\nSome interfaces stabilize, others do not. The ones that tends to\nstabilize are the ones at the boundaries between subsystems or\ncomponents. Internal interfaces may change daily. At the least,\nvirtually every new feature changes an interface somewhere.\n\n&gt;&gt; So explain to me the difference between what you describe and Pair\n&gt;&gt; Programming combined with TDD. Is it just that other programmers\nare,\n&gt;&gt; on their own, writing tests for my stuff after I&#39;ve written it?\n&gt;\n&gt;There can be. As with all things, team structure, process and\nmethodology\n&gt;can be tweaked to suit the team and the project. As you stated, TDD is\nnot\n&gt;primarily meant to find bugs, whereas independent unit testing is very\ngood\n&gt;at that, and generally that is its primary purpose; early testing. If\nyou\n&gt;have an XP team that is so good that they write perfect code, and a\n*good*\n&gt;independent unit tester can&#39;t find any bugs in the code, then don&#39;t\nuse\n&gt;independent unit testers and more power to you. But I have yet to see\nsuch\n&gt;a\n&gt;team or such developers - and I feel fairly confident that I could\nwrite\n&gt;unit tests that would find significant bugs in just about any new\ncodebase\n&gt;under development - including a codebase developed using TDD.\n\nI don&#39;t like the idea that they are writing tests on their own. My fear\nis that they will make different assumptions about the code&#39;s intended\nbehavior.\n\nBy the way, I stated that TDD is not meant to find bugs, period. Delete\n&quot;primarily&quot;. I conjecture that the reason that many people fight with\nProgrammer Tests is that they want PTs to find bugs, when that is not\ntheir purpose at all. Again, that is my opinion, but I think it&#39;s\nright.\n\n\nJ. B.
