We looked at Cactus and played with it a bit and were put off by some of the effort involved in making it work.  You have to address various client vs server deployment issues, it seems confusiong wrt what code is executed in the client vs the server ,etc.\n&gt; \n&gt;We decided not to devote that level of effort to Cactus just yet and instead are writing unit tests that act as clients to the session beans and testing them in that manner using the normal test runner.\n&gt; \n&gt;It&#39;s not clear to me what the disadvantages are to this approach.  Comments?\n&gt;\n\nI&#39;ve found no significant disadvantages to using this approach to \ntesting remotely-accessible methods of EJB components.  Then again, when \nI do use EJBs it&#39;s only to &quot;front&quot; a non-EJB component that can be \ntested outside of an EJB container.  That is, the EJB is strictly \nconduit.  So I guess I use the approach you mention for integration \ntesting, if that distinction matters.\n\nIMO, Cactus is great, if you absolutely must test from within the \ncontainer.  I strive to make those cases the exception, rather than the \nrule.    \n\nMike\n\n-- \nMike Clark\nhttp://clarkware.com\n(303) 589-3812\n\n\n\n\n",
