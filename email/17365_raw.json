As the original poster pointed out, the reality depicted in books\n&gt; about testing is very different from the real world, and practical advice\n&gt; for that is fairly scarce (yes, I read Michael Feather&#39;s book).\n\nWhich reality depicted in which books is different from what real-world \nexperience?\n\nAlso, if practical advice seems scarce, I venture it&#39;s for two reasons:\n\n1. It&#39;s not easy.\n2. Once someone like Feathers writes about it, there&#39;s no real need to \nduplicate it.\n\n&gt; That&#39;s one reason, there are plenty of others, such as &quot;We&#39;re approaching a\n&gt; deadline and I have to add this feature for our customer, so I&#39;ll do that\n&gt; instead of adding a test&quot;.\n\nI have felt that pain. Implementing /any/ change program, such as \nchanging the way you write code, is not a good idea when you&#39;re \napproaching a deadline. That&#39;s why I have found two key ways to \nintroduce programmer testing into a programmer&#39;s practice:\n\n1. by working on a side-project where there are no immediate deadlines, \nsuch as something open source or personal, OR\n\n2. by working on a desperate project where it couldn&#39;t get much \nworse--if you spend 2 weeks trying to write tests and don&#39;t get \nanywhere, that&#39;s fine, because 2 weeks trying to add to a horrible \ncodebase probably wouldn&#39;t have helped, either.\n\nI happened to do #2 instead of #1. Some people tell me #1 has worked for \nthem, too.\n\nTake care.\n-- \nJ. B.
