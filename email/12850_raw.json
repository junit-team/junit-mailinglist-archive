Most of the methods I add &quot;just for testing&quot; are query methods \nwithout side effects, so they&#39;re generally not dangerous. If I&#39;m /truly/ \nconcerned about keeping methods hidden, I can hide classes behind \ninterfaces, which tends to lead to more flexible designs, anyway.\n\n2. Excessive complexity of any form is to be scrutinized carefully. If \nwe must add complexity, I&#39;d rather add less than more, and a query \nmethod is certainly less complex than circumventing a code privilege \nsystem that ought not to have been there in the first place.\n\nIt appears, though, that we&#39;ve both done it both ways and that has led \nus to opposite conclusions. That&#39;s the kind of thing that makes life \ninteresting enough to keep living.\n\nTake care.\n-- \nJ. B.
