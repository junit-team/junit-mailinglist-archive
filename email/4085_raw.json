In this case, however, there is a wealth of test \n&gt; files (the\n&gt; backup PDBs from my Visor) which I can use to validate the \n&gt; object model.\n\nThe problem I see with that is: read/compare but compare to what ?\n\n&gt; \n&gt; But the idea is still the same - read/write/compare or \n&gt; write/read/compare.\n&gt; Are these the only tests you do for this kind of behavior?\n&gt;\n\nBasicaly, yes.\nThe idea being that my model has classes that encapsulate translation to and\nfrom XML (chain-of-responsibility with specific handlers for different type\nof objects). I don&#39;t want to make my tests dependent on the actual XML\nformat (or any other format) being used. Which makes me free to change the\nformat at any time, and still have valid tests.\nI do this both at the translation level and a higher level where actual\nserialization takes place.\nAt the translation level handlers have:\n\tpublic org.w3c.dom.Document write(Object object)\n\tpublic Object read(org.w3c.dom.Document)\nin the test:\n\tMyObject object = new MyObjectImpl();\n\tdocument = handler.write(object);\n\tassertNotNull(document);\n\tMyObject objectReadBack = (MyObject)handler.read(document);\n\t...\n\nThe only thing to verify is that the tests cover the entire state of the\noriginal instance and the instance read back.\nIt is possible to make a helper class that uses reflection to discover all\ngetXxx(...), isYyy(...), hasZzz(...) and compare two instances (maybe\nsomebody has done that already ?). Then use that in the tests to assert\nequality.\n\n",
