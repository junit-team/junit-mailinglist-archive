Compaq Web Language) which is very pleasant to work with but seems to be dying. \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nI found myself writing pages to be testable by marking up interesting bits of the page so I could find them. For example, if I included my error messages in &lt;span id=&quot;errorMessage&quot;&gt; I could just write\r<br/>\nfindSpansWithId(&quot;errorMessage&quot;). Of course, I discovered that coding for testability made other things easy, as everything was ready for using stylesheets without much extra preparation.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nSteve\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Shane Duan&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sduan@...\">sduan@...</a>&gt;\r<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; I worked in WebMacro before and the lead there (actually the boss) seted up\r<br/>\n&gt; an testing environment that can generate the output text of a WebMacro page.\r<br/>\n&gt; Then we use a Java-Perl tool to parse the resulting string.  For example, if\r<br/>\n&gt; we want to assert title, we just ask for a mach of the regular expression\r<br/>\n&gt; (*&lt;html&gt;*&lt;head&gt;*&lt;title&gt;[Title Text]&lt;/title&gt;*&lt;/head&gt;*&lt;/html&gt;).\r<br/>\n&gt; \r<br/>\n&gt; We ended up (through refactoring) having a customized test case that can do\r<br/>\n&gt; things like assertTitle, assertCheckBoxName, assertCheckBoxSelected.  (Off\r<br/>\n&gt; the thread, what we have built through testing and refactoring was so\r<br/>\n&gt; comprehensive and efficient that I was totoally converted into XP. :)  ) </span></blockquote></div>",
