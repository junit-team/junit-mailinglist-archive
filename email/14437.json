However, there *seems* to be an assumption in this thread<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; that multilpe asserts per test are somehow related to each other, such<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; that if one fails and I fix it then the other possibly failing asserts<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; would be fixed at the same time.  That is not always, and perhaps<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; generally, not the case.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I believe it is, if the test is focused on a small bit of functionality.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; It is focused on a small bit of functionality and the asserts are not <br/>\n&gt; related to each other.  The functionality is the application of a <br/>\n&gt; CreditMemo to an existing sale, for which there may or may not be <br/>\n&gt; related sales (eg. a purchased recurring sale, a recurring sale in <br/>\n&gt; negotiation, one or more &quot;upsales&quot;, etc.).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Oof! You have a much larger definition of &quot;small bit of functionality&quot; than<br/>\nI do ;-).  That sounds like a big chunk of an application to me.<br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; Is it necessary (or even desirable) to test both these things in the<br/>\n </span></blockquote>same<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; test?  Could you perhaps do one test to show applying the CreditMemo to<br/>\n </span></blockquote>a<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; Sale does the right thing, and a second to show applying it to a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; RecurringSale is correct?  If these two actions happen in different <br/>\n&gt; &gt; classes,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; why would you need to test them at the same time?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; But, that was the point.  Applying it to the sale has a cascade effect <br/>\n&gt; on its related sales.  You could do a separate test for each thing but I <br/>\n&gt; tend to hate the duplication even more!  In the contrived example (based <br/>\n&gt; on reality) there should be no need to directly apply the CreditMemo for <br/>\n&gt; an originatingSale to one of its related sales.  It happens behind the <br/>\n&gt; scenes.  The test is testing that the direct effect on the originating <br/>\n&gt; sale takes place as well as the behind-the-scenes effect on its related <br/>\n&gt; sales.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I do not know your application, but I might consider a comprehensive set of<br/>\ntests just to make sure CreditMemos get applied correctly to all the related<br/>\nsales objects.  Then the test for the application to an originating sale<br/>\njust has to test the cascade happened, maybe even with a mock object.  You<br/>\nwould not have to check the related sale updated &quot;correctly&quot;.  You already<br/>\ndid that in more focused tests.  Is there any reason the code would function<br/>\ndifferently when called from the original sale than when called from your<br/>\ntests?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Mind you, also, that I am not truly advocating multiple failures per <br/>\n&gt; test... I am playing &quot;devil&#39;s advocate&quot; in order to shine some light on <br/>\n&gt; what seems to be forgotten territory.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Oh, me too.  I am not trying to be dogmatic, and I am still learning TDD.  I<br/>\njust wanted to be the advocate for the other side.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJim McMaster<br/>\nmailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jim.mcmaster@...\">jim.mcmaster@...</a></div>",
