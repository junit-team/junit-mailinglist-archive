Are you trying to have\n&gt; the tests run everytime someone runs the app?  Who are\n&gt; reffering to with the word &quot;users&quot;?  Users of the app?\n&gt; \nI&#39;m a teacher, and want to create a test suite so that my students can \ncheck the correctness of their practical exercises, even if they&#39;re \nworking at home or other remote location.\n\nReading the web start documentation a bit more carefully I&#39;ve located \nthe general problem.  Web deployed apps must be written with that in \nmind, eg using getResource rather than trying to access resources (eg \nimages, text files) from the file system (and the local classpath \nvariable cannot be used either, which complicates matters for my \nparticular purpose).  I think I&#39;ll just stay with local media rather \nthan a web-based solution.\n\n\n\n\n\n",
