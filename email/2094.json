I&#39;ll know for next time.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy problem is that I am probably trying to use JUnit in a way that it<br/>\nwasn&#39;t intended to be used. I am not actually testing that a single<br/>\nmethod functions correctly ( i have seperate tests for this that work<br/>\nfine), I am testing that a method setAttribute() can set a value of an<br/>\nattribute in a database and I then assert that a method getAttribute()<br/>\nreturns me the expected value. <br/>\n<br/>\nI am hoping to test that all the attributes in the database can be set<br/>\nand that someone hasn&#39;t unwittingly changed a particular attribute to<br/>\nread-only. It would seem to be overkill to have a test method for each<br/>\nof the hundreds of attributes. So i currently do the following,<br/>\n<br/>\n\t- add a failure to a testResult<br/>\n\t- fail if the testResult failureCount &gt; 0<br/>\n\t- print out all the failures<br/>\n<br/>\nIf anyone can help me with a better approach I would be grateful.<br/>\n<br/>\nthanx again</div>",
