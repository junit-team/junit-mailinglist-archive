However, every time someone  asks a <br/>\nmailing list, &quot;How do I do X?&quot; when the answer is sitting right inside <br/>\nthe JavaDocs somewhere is a code smell. I know JUnit fairly well, but <br/>\nI&#39;ve still asked one or two questions here that were answered in the API <br/>\ndocs if I&#39;d looked in the right package.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf the API were smaller, easier to search, and easier to comprehend, <br/>\nthen there&#39;d be fewer questions about it.  Users would be able to help <br/>\nthemselves more frequently. Size alone is a significant contributor to <br/>\ncomplexity. The more methods and classes there are to hunt through, the <br/>\nharder it is to find what you&#39;re looking for. JUnit is a relatively <br/>\nsmall and simple API. If it has these problems, imagine how much worse <br/>\nthey are for larger, more complex APIs.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n﻿Elliotte Rusty Harold  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:elharo@...\">elharo@...</a><br/>\nXML in a Nutshell 3rd Edition Just Published!<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.cafeconleche.org/books/xian3/\">http://www.cafeconleche.org/books/xian3/</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0596007647/cafeaulaitA/ref=nosim\">http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0596007647/cafeaulaitA/ref=nosim</a></div>",
