It&#39;s more code to write, test and maintain\nand it gets in the way when I do need to create more than one.  For example,\nin unit tests.  Or when requirements change.\n\n--Nat\n\n\n\nOn 30/07/07, jason r tibbetts &lt;tibbettj@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;   Pat,\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; This may be a bit off charter, but I&#39;ve been reading some well argued\n&gt; &gt; articles that have names such as &quot;Why is Singleton evil?&quot; and at the top\n&gt; &gt; of the list are troubles that the singleton pattern causes for unit\n&gt; &gt; testing. (which is on topic.)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The usual suggestions for rewriting the code are offered, such as using\n&gt; &gt; a factory class to allocate/create objects, and always always just\n&gt; &gt; returning the one and only.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; So far, so good. But, the Factory class has to keep a store of\n&gt; &gt; anti-singletons. And the usual call is something like\n&gt; &gt; AntiSingleton anAnti = Factory.createAntiSingleton();\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Which is used statically, and implies that the Factory is a singleton so\n&gt; &gt; its cache of AntiSingletons can be kept in one and only one store.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m not seeing how changing the Singleton class to a class that needs\n&gt; &gt; the singleton Factory class has done anything. We&#39;ve still got a\n&gt; &gt; singleton, and so all arguments that there is implied coupling, and bad\n&gt; &gt; karma for testing still hold.\n&gt;\n&gt; I don&#39;t see any mention yet in this thread of the simplest solution of\n&gt; them all: put all of the singleton&#39;s implementation in a non-singleton\n&gt; abstract base class, then subclass it as a singleton. The abstract base\n&gt; class can be subclassed separately for testing. In other words,\n&gt;\n&gt; // abstract base class\n&gt; public abstract class Foo {\n&gt; protected Foo() { }\n&gt;\n&gt; public String getBar() { return &quot;bar!&quot;; }\n&gt; }\n&gt;\n&gt; // singleton implementation\n&gt; public final class TheOneTrueFoo extends Foo {\n&gt; private TheOneTrueFoo() { super(); }\n&gt;\n&gt; public static Foo getInstance() { return foo; }\n&gt;\n&gt; private final static Foo = new TheOneTrueFoo();\n&gt; }\n&gt;\n&gt; // test-only implementation\n&gt; public final class TestFoo {\n&gt; public TestFoo() { super(); }\n&gt; }\n&gt;\n&gt; Voila! The 3 statements in the singleton implementation go untested, but\n&gt; all of the rest of Foo can be tested normally.\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n",
