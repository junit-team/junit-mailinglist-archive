It&#39;s a shame really, and I hope to help \nchange that mentality.  One of my tactics in doing so, as you well know, \nis to convince readers that testing is also a design activity.  As such, \nI should be able to change any phrase about testing into a phrase about \ndesign.  It&#39;s something I&#39;ve been practicing, and this title is one \nattempt.     \n\nNow, please write that article!  :-)\n\nMike\n\n-- \nMike Clark\nhttp://clarkware.com\n(720) 851-2014\n\n\n\n\n",
