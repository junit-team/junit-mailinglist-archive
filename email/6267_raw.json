Rainsberger wrote:\n\nIf you&#39;re asking me...\n\n&gt;I believe that building the tests needs to be performed by a human,\n&gt;because that&#39;s where the knowledge lies. \n&gt;\n\nYeah, I guess I&#39;m saying it works best for me if I get to pick which \ntests go into which suites.  It&#39;s an organizational exercise that lends \nitself to the way I run tests.  \n\nI know of many ways to search for and run all tests in the system.  When \nI&#39;ve needed to do that, and for some reason I don&#39;t have an AllTests \nsuite already built, I use the Ant batchtest.  I can&#39;t say I&#39;ve pulled \nthat lever as a safeguard against forgetting to add tests to a suite \nthough.  Alas, it&#39;s not because I have a good memory.  Rather, when \nbuilding things test-first I generally notice those errors of omission \nearly.      \n\n&gt;If there were a nice graphical\n&gt;tool to make it easy, would that help? \n&gt;\n\nPerhaps.  Eclipse has a wizard for creating a test suite, allowing you \nto pick which test classes to include from a list of tests it \nautomagically finds.  I haven&#39;t used it much, but think I might try it \nfor a while.  I can always fall back to writing the suites by hand.    \n\n&gt;Is it worth your while to build it?\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nI couldn&#39;t justify building it given my current needs.  That&#39;s not to \nsay if it were built I wouldn&#39;t use it, but it&#39;s not a tool I reach for.\n\nMIke\n\n-- \nMike Clark\nhttp://clarkware.com \n(720) 851-2014\n\n\n\n",
