    "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1478169389\">Hi Cédric,<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; FYI, a few more reactions and articles on the same topic.  It looks like<br/>\n&gt;  most of the Java and Ruby communities (last link) are typically using a<br/>\n&gt;  small portion of TDD and a majority of regular testing, which matches my<br/>\n&gt;  experience.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t think anyone ever disagreed that &quot;regular testing&quot; interpreted<br/>\nto mean automated acceptance testing and unit testing is not done to<br/>\nthe extent we would like to see on this list. I don&#39;t think anyone<br/>\nneeds to be convinced about this, this is a known fact, one that a lot<br/>\nof us believe should change. It is in the conclusions that can be<br/>\nderived from that where opinions differ. You seem to say that since<br/>\nmost software is not &quot;regularly tested&quot; and most software works great<br/>\nyou can abviously do perfectly well without &quot;regular testing&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nMyself and others have argued that most software can work better and<br/>\nthat our acceptance for errors is too high. David Saff also made an<br/>\ninteresting comment about all the software we don&#39;t see, the software<br/>\nwe don&#39;t use and the software that is never released. I think it is<br/>\nnatural that popular software used by many works great, or it<br/>\nwouldn&#39;&#39;t be popular. Popular software can also deferr some testing to<br/>\ntheir &quot;beta&quot;-testers and &quot;get away with it&quot;. But that is just a small<br/>\nfraction of all the software written.<br/>\n<br/>\nI personally think that you are way wrong that there is code that is<br/>\not tested and works. I think that all software out there is tested,<br/>\nmeaning some effort has been made to ensure that it works. There are<br/>\nhard ways and easy ways to test software. The easy way (I think it is<br/>\nautomated testing) is the most reliable while the hard way requires<br/>\nsome guesswork and predictions coupled with manual effort.<br/>\n<br/>\nI followed the first link and got a little bit upset by one of your<br/>\ntranscriptions of a supposedly rethorical answer:<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;One response to the question suggests that there are only two types<br/>\nof code: Code that is tested and works and code that is not tested and<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t work. Cedric&#39;s take on the subject is that there are ways of<br/>\nknowing that your code is working without actually testing it. So we<br/>\nshould also include a third category: Code that is not tested and<br/>\nworks.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThat was your subjective interpretation of what Robert C Martin wrote.<br/>\nWhen you asked for clarification you asked:<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;You seem to imply that there are only two kinds of code:<br/>\n<br/>\n - Code that is tested and works<br/>\n - Code that is not tested and doesn&#39;t work<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is actually something in the middle: it&#39;s called &quot;Code that<br/>\nis not<br/>\ntested but that works&quot;.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThat was the interpretation you used in the blog-entry.<br/>\nThe reply came:<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;The two kinds of code are:<br/>\n<br/>\n- Code you have tested, and you know works to the best of your<br/>\nability to determine.<br/>\n- Code you have not tested and don&#39;t know if it works.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you haven&#39;t tested the code, you don&#39;t know that it works. If you<br/>\nHAVE tested the code then you know that it passes your tests.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy didn&#39;t you just post the statement as it was written instead of<br/>\nyour subjective interpretation? Your interpretation sure has more<br/>\npunch that the real thing but it is obviously  not what the author<br/>\nmeant.<br/>\n<br/>\nI really admire you taking a stand in this discussion and in this<br/>\nforum. A lot of really good discussion has come out of it and not many<br/>\nare so brave as you are to go against the flow on a board like this.<br/>\nBut when you post subjective interpretaions like the one above you<br/>\nloose credibility, atleast with me. And I think that is a shame<br/>\nbecause you obviously have a message that you want to get through<br/>\nwith. I think your opinions deserves to be listened to and evaluated.<br/>\n<br/>\nI didn&#39;t read the rest of the links or the comments, perhaps something<br/>\nmore interesting or would have com up there.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust one mans opinion<br/>\n/J</div>",
