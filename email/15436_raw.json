Short answer is that\n&gt; assertion (exceptions) can&#39;t get out of the run()\n&gt; method.  See the JUnit email list archives for\n&gt; more on this.  Or read a good JUnit book.\n\nThanks for the answers. I managed to trace the problem to my tearDown()\nmethod. The fail() causes teadDown() to be called before it prints its\noutput. In tearDown() I called the setVisible(false) on a JFrame object,\nand this call shouldn&#39;t be made from outside the event queue thread, and\nnow it caused an Exception. So, it was a threading issue.\n\nWhat is very counter-intuitive here is that if you get an exception in\ntearDown method, you don&#39;t get any output at all. Your Ant build thinks\nthe tests passed. Unless I was misunderstanding something, it would\nbe another refactoring suggestion to make sure an error is reported when\nan exception is thrown from tearDown().\n\nAs for the fact that you can&#39;t get the _original_ exception out from your\nRunnable, it&#39;s true, but it&#39;s not the whole truth. I think the important\npoint here is that as long as my tearDown method works OK, I am able to\nget _some_ exception out from the Runnable, and thus make my Ant build\nfail if the test fails.\n\nAlso, it&#39;s possible to call the fail() method from inside the Runnable,\nas long as it is an inner class of TestCase. This is how it looks when I \ndo that:\n\njava.lang.reflect.InvocationTargetException\n        at java.awt.EventQueue.invokeAndWait(EventQueue.java:851)\n       ...\nCaused by: junit.framework.AssertionFailedError\n       ...\n\nSo, I don&#39;t directly get the AssertionFailedError out from Runnable, but I\ndo get some exception anyway. If I needed the original exception, I could\nunwrap it from the InvocationTargetException, but I don&#39;t need that here,\nas the InvocationTargetException is enough to make my build fail\nappropriately.\n\nCurrently it seems that I&#39;m able to handle my simple need with plain\nJUnit, but I will consider those GUI testing frameworks for more\ncomprehensive testing.\n\nThanks,\nVesa\n\n\n\n",
