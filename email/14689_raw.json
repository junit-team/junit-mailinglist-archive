The major drawback that we had was that the results were included with the actual test results.  So, when we looked at our overall test results (from our nightlybuild) it was difficult to easily see what failures were due to code, and which were just due to lack of coverage (had to dig into each package and class).\n\n-------------- Original message -------------- \nI also find Hansel to be interesting. It&#39;s not an Eclipse plugin, but a\nJunit extension, that makes the tests fail if a class isn&#39;t fully covered.\n\nCheers, Ilja\n\n\n\nSPONSORED LINKS Basic programming language C programming language Computer programming languages \nThe c programming language C programming language List of programming languages \n\n\n\nYAHOO!
