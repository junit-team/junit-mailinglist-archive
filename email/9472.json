One of their tools minimizes the<br/>\n&gt; length of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; names where possible (it&#39;s not possible where a name is part of a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; published interface). Using this and other techniques they<br/>\n&gt; typically<br/>\n&gt; &gt; shrink Java code by well over 50% for a small one-time cost in<br/>\n&gt; terms of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; computer cycles (it takes about 4 minutes to process 3.8 MB of<br/>\n&gt; code on an<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 800 MHz PC).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; That&#39;s an interesting assertion.  I&#39;m not sure that I can relate it<br/>\n&gt; to the presence or absence of comments, particularly since comments<br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t end up in the compiled code.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Of course.  But one of the subthreads in this discussion is that<br/>\ncomments can be made unnecessary by, for example, appropriate choice<br/>\nof variable/method/class/etc names.  This is something that we all do, I<br/>\nimagine.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut the longer and more meaningful the names, the slower the code ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;                                   If this compression of names is<br/>\n&gt; that beneficial, then it sounds like it should be a part of the<br/>\n&gt; automated build process i.e.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Source Code In ---&gt; Everything renamed to short names --&gt; Compiler --<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Result<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Agreed.  Googling tells me that IBM&#39;s software can be found at<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.alphaworks.ibm.com/tech/JAX\">http://www.alphaworks.ibm.com/tech/JAX</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; There is a reasonably reliable relationship between code size and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; speed. Less than half as many bytes typically means software that<br/>\n&gt; &gt; runs more than twice as fast.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I would have expected that choice of algorithm, correct use of<br/>\n&gt; buffered I/O and so on would have a larger effect on performance<br/>\n&gt; than the relative size in bytes of the compiled result.  Is the<br/>\n&gt; article online for us to examine?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It&#39;s somewhere on www.acm.org, but I think that you have to be a<br/>\nmember to view it for free.  The article is &quot;Extracting Library-Based<br/>\nJava Applications&quot;, authors Frank Tip et al, _Communications of the<br/>\nACM_, August 2003, vol 46, no 8.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is just one of the articles; the entire issue is focused on<br/>\nprogram compaction.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, we are talking partial derivatives here.  That is, given<br/>\na specific algorithm, use of buffered I/O, etc, if you have twice<br/>\nas much code to execute it&#39;s likely to take twice as long.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; Sure, but bear in mind the cost of using long names and an expanded<br/>\n&gt; &gt; class hierarchy to replace comments.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m not clear what the cost of using long variable names is.  Could<br/>\n&gt; you go into further detail about what the costs of the above two<br/>\n&gt; are?  I also suspect that if either of these things has a<br/>\n&gt; significant cost, then we are using wrong tools, or the right tools<br/>\n&gt; incorrectly.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>As I recall, the constant pool is typically around 70% of the size<br/>\nof a Java .class file and the bytecode something like 14%.  A large<br/>\npart of the constant pool is just names.<br/>\n<br/>\nI haven&#39;t measured these things myself; I am relying upon perhaps<br/>\nimperfect memory of someone else&#39;s work.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you look at the bytecode of a typical method you can see how<br/>\nexpensive referring to interfaces or in fact anything by name is.<br/>\nSee <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://jakarta.apache.org/bcel\">http://jakarta.apache.org/bcel</a> and especially the bcelifier<br/>\nfor this.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I must confess, I am definitely one of the &#39;comment extremely<br/>\n&gt; sparsely&#39; crowd.  What might be interesting is if we perhaps wrote a<br/>\n&gt; Ruby program to process a Java source tree, replacing the symbols<br/>\n&gt; with the smallest identifiers possible, unless they are tagged with<br/>\n&gt; a @published tag for external compatibility reasons.  I would expect<br/>\n&gt; to be able to produce a readable and maintainable program to do this<br/>\n&gt; with very few comments indeed.  I also expect to be able to write a<br/>\n&gt; program to convert a stack trace back to the original symbols, again<br/>\n&gt; with very few comments.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Do you think that might be a worthwhile or interesting exercise?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Sure.  However, why not just write the thing in Java?<br/>\n<br/>\nI have in mind doing something like this for a large code set,<br/>\nprobably JBoss.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe object would be an Ant/Maven-compatible tool and a set of publicly<br/>\nmaintained results.  Statistics like &quot;the constant pool is X% of JBoss<br/>\nclasses&quot; and &quot;bytecode is Y% of such classes&quot; should be valuable, as<br/>\nwould be benchmarks of performance improvements from shrinking code.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I can higly recommend &#39;Refactoring&#39; by Martin Fowler.  He has lots<br/>\n&gt; of great ideas and examples relating to identifying code quality,<br/>\n&gt; and a few bits on unit testing too.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Noted. ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJim Dixon  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jdd@...\">jdd@...</a>   tel +44 117 982 0786  mobile +44 797 373 7881</div>",
