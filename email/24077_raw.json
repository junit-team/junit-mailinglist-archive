To be backwards-compatible junit =\r\nshould\ndepend on hamcrest, however. Otherwise we have to increase the major=\r\n\nversion number.\n\njunit could then be a project only consisting of dependen=\r\ncies without\nany (Java-) source, right?\n\njunit depends on junit-core\n      =\r\n depends on junit-assertions depends on hamcrest\n\n+1 for making AssumptionV=\r\niolatedException non-internal and putting\norg.junit.Assume into junit-asser=\r\ntions as well. Throwing an exception\nis no real biggy. I refrained from doi=\r\nng so because the package\nindicated AssumptionViolatedException to be inter=\r\nnal.\n\nRegards Mirko\n\n\nOn Thu, Nov 1, 2012 at 9:59 PM, Paul Holser &lt;pholser@=\r\nyahoo.com&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Marc, I agree that Hamcrest is a terrific library for e=\r\nxpressing expected test outcomes. So is FEST-Assert. If my tests are small =\r\nand focused enough, I might even roll with native Java assertions. The Asse=\r\nrtionError (or, really, any exception that propagates out of a test) repres=\r\nents sort of an implicit contract between test and runner: signal the test =\r\nas failed if the exception makes it out of the test unhandled. There are lo=\r\nts of ways to satisfy that contract; I&#39;m not sure that one based on Hamcres=\r\nt has to be the answer.\n&gt;\n&gt; The time period between JUnit 4.4 and 4.11 was =\r\nchallenging for those developers who wanted some of the goodness of Hamcres=\r\nt &gt; 1.1, what with the attendant Maven exclusions, surprising failures, and=\r\n so forth. It led me to wonder whether Assert/Assume ought to be separate f=\r\nrom the core of JUnit. Then, the putative &quot;junit-assertions&quot; module could d=\r\nepend on Hamcrest if it so chose, and &quot;junit-core&quot; (made-up module that doe=\r\nsn&#39;t exist right now) wouldn&#39;t have to. Further, developers could choose to=\r\n use junit-assertions or not; Hamcrest alone (with MatcherAssert.assertThat=\r\n()) or not; FEST-Assert, etc.\n&gt;\n&gt; I think of AssumptionViolatedException as=\r\n another implicit contract between test and runner. Right now, though, unle=\r\nss you want to depend on a public-but-not-published AssumptionViolatedExcep=\r\ntion class that you need Hamcrest to use, org.junit.Assume is the only way =\r\nto satisfy that contract. Better would be to have AssumptionViolatedExcepti=\r\non be part of &quot;junit-core&quot;, not depending on Hamcrest, and letting Assume l=\r\nive in &quot;junit-assertions&quot; and handle the Hamcrest matching.\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;ll send m=\r\nore under separate cover, maybe as a GitHub issue, as this doesn&#39;t pertain =\r\nso much to JUnit 4.11 beta 1 as it does a consideration for the next major =\r\nversion of JUnit. I think it&#39;d be interesting to explore segmenting JUnit i=\r\nnto a multi-module project with dependencies teased out a bit.\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks a=\r\ngain for your excellent work and stewardship!\n&gt;\n&gt; --p\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In junit@ya=\r\nhoogroups.com, Marc Philipp &lt;mphilipp82@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; From my very pers=\r\nonal point-of-view I cannot imagine using JUnit without\n&gt;&gt; Hamcrest anymore=\r\n.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; @Paul: What would be the benefit of &quot;breaking the dependency&quot; entir=\r\nely?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; @Mirko: Why shouldn&#39;t you be able to use a different version of =\r\nHamcrest?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Regards, Marc\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; [Non-text portions of this message h=\r\nave been removed]\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yah=\r\noo!
