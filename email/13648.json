In this case, the one-time set up should simply parse the<br/>\n&gt; XML file, create the DOM tree and then use the class to perform various<br/>\n&gt; verifications on this tree.  And of course, we don&#39;t want to re-parse<br/>\n&gt; it every time.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Hold on a second -- what do you want to test, an XML /file/ or the <br/>\nrepresentation in memory? If you test the transformation from file to <br/>\nobjects in memory, you probably want to parse again in each test with <br/>\nslightly different XML input.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you don&#39;t want to test the XML to object mapping, then why bother with <br/>\nXML at all in the test? Just create a bunch of objects to play with and <br/>\nskip the XML part.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I can come up with a lot of examples where such a fine grained (or<br/>\n&gt; coarse grained, in this case) setUp/tearDown life cycle is necessary<br/>\n&gt; without the tests being dependent on each other.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Please give an example where it does affect your test results if the setup <br/>\ncode runs for each test and where you still claim that the tests are <br/>\nindependent.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers,<br/>\n<br/>\nRobert</div>",
