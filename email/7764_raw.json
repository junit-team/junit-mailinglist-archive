Since every test in JUnit is a method, it&#39;s often times easy to  \nconvince yourself at first that every method is a test.  This is not  \nthe case.  Your tests perform 5 atomic operations separate from your  \ntests.  They are: create, update, delete, exists, result.  These are  \nregular methods; They are not tests.  The tests you want are  \ncompositions of those operations.\n\n// Your tests\n\npublic void testCreate() {\n\tassertFalse(exists());\n\tcreate();\n\tassertTrue(exists());\n\tdelete();\n}\n\npublic void testUpdate() {\n\tint expected = 1;\n\tcreate();\n\tassertFalse(expected == result());\n\tupdate();\n\tassertTrue(expected == result());\n\tdelete();\n}\n\npublic void testDelete() {\n\tcreate();\n\tassertTrue(exists());\n\tdelete();\n\tassertFalse(exists());\n}\n\nNot every method is a test.\n\n-shane\n\nOn Wednesday, April 16, 2003, at 01:26  PM, javainsel wrote:\n\n&gt; We want to test the creation, update and deletion of an object which\n&gt; is persisted in database.\n&gt;\n&gt; What we now do is to have three test methods for this.\n&gt;\n&gt; In the testCreate method the object is created, checked that he is\n&gt; really created and then it is deleted (we have delete because\n&gt; unfortunately we don&#39;t use Mock Objects).\n&gt;\n&gt; In the testUpdate method we create the object, update it, test the\n&gt; update result and delete the created object.\n&gt;\n&gt; In the testDelete method we create the object so that we can test\n&gt; the deletion of it.\n&gt;\n&gt; As you see, everything is included in the testUpdate method. We\n&gt; duplicate much code in the other two test methods.\n&gt;\n&gt; We write such tests for every domain object so I wonder if we should\n&gt; improve our test class.\n&gt;\n&gt; Would you write 3 or just 1 test method for that example?\n&gt;\n&gt; And would you try to convince senior coworkers who know little about\n&gt; JUnit and dislike TDD?\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------ Yahoo!
