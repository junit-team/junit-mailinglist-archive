This semester I&#39;m in Data Structures and our\n&gt; first project is to write implementations of a List. Our classes\n&gt; implement a ListADT interface, but we have to write three different\n&gt; implementations, one using Fixed Arrays, on that can &quot;Dynamically&quot;\n&gt; resize arrays, and a Link List. We also have to write a tests to\n&gt; ensure our list implementations are good. Having heard of JUnit I\n&gt; thought this would be a good time to learn it. So far it has worked\n&gt; fine for testing a single implementation. I have several TestCase\n&gt; classes testing different aspects of the list, and have added them to\n&gt; a sutie so that they can be all be run at once. However, I want to be\n&gt; able to test all three implementations at once in on fell swoop, with\n&gt; out having to write three sets of test cases and three test suites.\n\nGoogle &quot;Abstract Test Cases&quot;. You can run one set of common tests for \nall three implementations where the only difference is how to create the \nobject under test.\n\nAlternatively, if your bookstore carries _JUnit Recipes_, check out \nchapter 2. (If it doesn&#39;t, complain.)\n-- \nJ. B.
