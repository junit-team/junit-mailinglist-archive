Keeping the methods as strings\n&gt;  &gt; allows me to write the test, compile it, and even run it before I decide\n&gt;  &gt; whether the interface or method signature is good enough to start\n&gt;  &gt; putting into stone.\n&gt; \n&gt; 1) With that method, you never see the method\n&gt;     as a real method call as in EasyMock. Compare\n&gt; \n&gt; control.expectAndReturn(mock.copy(destination, source), true);   // \n&gt; EasyMock 1.2\n&gt; \n&gt; expect(mock.copy(destination, source)).andReturn(true); // EasyMock 2.0 \n&gt; / 2.1\n&gt; \n&gt; to\n&gt; \n&gt; mock.expects(once()).method(&quot;copy&quot;).with( eq(destination), eq(source) \n&gt; ).will(returnValue\n&gt; (true)); // JMock\n&gt; \n&gt; In the EasyMock examples, both show how the method\n&gt; is used copy(destination, source) and returning true.\n&gt; It is easy to see that the parameters should be reordered,\n&gt; and with refactoring-tools, it&#39;s quite fast.\n&gt; \n&gt; In the JMock example, it is not that easy to spot the method call, because\n&gt; the method name is in a string, and the parameters are separated from \n&gt; this string.\n&gt; It is harder to see that the parameters should be reordered,\n&gt; and as refactoring tools don&#39;t work, it&#39;s a pain - especially if\n&gt; the method is used more than once already in the tests, you have to change\n&gt; every single ocurrence by hand.\n\nAs I stated before, while I acknowledge this problem, the other benefits \nfrom jMock make up for this cost /so far/, /for me/. I find that I don&#39;t \nchange methods on interfaces too frequently. Typically, I change them on \nclasses before I extract the corresponding interface. By the time I \nextract the interface, the method is quite stable.\n\nAlso, I introduce Parameter Objects quite quickly, which reduces the \nneed to reorder parameters or change parameter lists.\n\n&gt; 2) Can you explain on how you test-drive a plain old java method then,\n&gt; without adding a body for it?\n\nI might not have been clear: in this case, I&#39;m test-driving class A, \nwhich I see needs a collaborator, so I introduce interface B. In this \ncase, while test-driving an implementation for A, I&#39;m designing the \ninterface for B. It is B&#39;s methods (and not A&#39;s) which I can design \nwithout having even to declare a method signature. After I write a test \nand am happy with the design, I run the test, watch it fail because the \nnew method is not yet on B, then I add it to B.\n-- \nJ. B.
