After all how will you know it<br/>\nwhen you see it? If you get exactly the randomness that you were looking<br/>\nfor, wouldn&#39;t that mean that there was a problem with your randomness?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On 6/16/05, eriknusanet &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:erikn@...\">erikn@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; Hi, I&#39;m new to JUnit.  I&#39;m wondering what is the right way to set up <br/>\n&gt; some random tests?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Should I just put into my tests a loop runs the test multiple times? <br/>\n&gt; This seems to imply that the test needs to call setUp() to get some <br/>\n&gt; fresh objects (&quot;test fixture&quot;) each time through the loop, which seems <br/>\n&gt; somehow wrong (at least I&#39;ve seen no examples like this).  Is there <br/>\n&gt; some better way to ask for a test to be run N times?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I got turned on to JUnit from the book<br/>\n&gt;   Building Parsers with JavaT by Steven John Metsker<br/>\n&gt; however it seems that he does not use JUnit for random tests.  He has <br/>\n&gt; a section extolling JUnit, but then a section immediately after about <br/>\n&gt; random testing that doesn&#39;t use JUnit at all.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Perhaps random testing is not considered part of unit testing?
