Mark was making another suggestion. \nI&#39;m not sure whether I like it.\n\nIn my work with singletons, I have invariably concluded that must of them \ndid not need to be singletons. I usually turn singletons into otherwise \nnormal classes and use factories, where necessary. This was the reason for \nmy suggestion.\n\nIf you find that you really want a singleton, let&#39;s revisit this question \nand see if we can solve it. :)\n\n===========================================\nJ.
