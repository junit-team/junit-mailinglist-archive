I&#39;ve learned a lot during this time, thank you<br/>\n&gt;all, guys.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;In this post, I&#39;d like to discuss a problem of test naming. <br/>\n&gt;I mean not only test naming, but also naming of test classes, <br/>\n&gt;packages and methods. <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;When one starts writing tests for legacy code (or even for new one),<br/>\n&gt;there is a common task - find existing tests for some code (if there<br/>\n </span></blockquote>are<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;any), and decide, how to name new tests. Sometimes the task is<br/>\n </span></blockquote>obvious, <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;but not always. Shall one include the name of the class under test <br/>\n&gt;into the test class name? Shall one include name of the tested method <br/>\n&gt;into testXXX method? Or it depends?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;As far as I learned, usually we shall test behaviour and design, <br/>\n&gt;not specific classes and methods. This allows us to keep tests <br/>\n&gt;task-oriented and not implementation-oriented.<br/>\n&gt;Considering this, I see the following possible decisions regarding<br/>\n&gt;tests organization: <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;1. For Functional tests:<br/>\n&gt;    - all tests for a use case (and, possibly, alternative flows) are <br/>\n&gt;    placed into a single package with an appropriate name. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Generally there is one test per use case scenario (different flow<br/>\nthrough the use case). Choosing to write more or fewer tests should be<br/>\ndone thoughtfully.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;    - each test scenario is placed into single class with appropriate<br/>\n </span></blockquote>name.<br/>\n<br/>\nEach use case scenario is a test. Test classes should almost always<br/>\nevolve based around a fixture, not some other arbitrary organization<br/>\nmechanism. A given use case may be implemented as its own Customer Test<br/>\nclass, but it is usually better to let the organization of tests into<br/>\nTestCase implementations depend on shared fixture requirements.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;2. For Unit tests:<br/>\n&gt;    - test package shall be the same as for the production code, <br/>\n&gt;    but it is better to use a different source tree.<br/>\n&gt;    - for simple classes (such as value objects) it is OK to name<br/>\n&gt;    test classes after the name of the class under test <br/>\n&gt;    (like UTestFooBar or FooBarTest). Names of test methods,<br/>\n&gt;    in its turn, may include the name of the tested method.<br/>\n&gt;    - for complex classes, which require a complex fixture to be set,<br/>\n&gt;    test case class shall be named using fixture description. <br/>\n&gt;    (The issue was discussed previously on this list).<br/>\n&gt;    Test method name in this case shall describe the tested behaviour.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>The last point is the general case, and the previous points are special<br/>\ncases when the tests (not the code under test) are very simple.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;3. For Integration Tests:<br/>\n&gt;    - I suggest, names of Integration tests must differ from Unit<br/>\n </span></blockquote>tests.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;    Usually, integration tests run longer, and consequently, more<br/>\n </span></blockquote>seldom. <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;    That&#39;s why it is convinient to name them differently. One may name<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;    unit tests using UTest prefix, anf Integration tests using ITest<br/>\n&gt;prefix.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>On a past project, we used tag interfaces to distinguish Programmer<br/>\nTests from Customer Tests. This made it easy to write a TestRunner that<br/>\npicked one or the other or both when building a test suite. You may<br/>\nfind this technique useful.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, place the different kinds of tests in different packages in order<br/>\nto reduce the number of naming collisions.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have to say that your list of points is excellent and should be<br/>\nturned into a short article on the subject.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nJ.
