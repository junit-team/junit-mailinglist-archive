I meant in your <br/>\nfailing test, before and after the invocation of the Class Under Test. <br/>\nHowever, use whatever works - and the assert approach may not work at all.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, I&#39;ll mention another idea, although it may be anathema to this <br/>\nlist.  If you can somehow DETECT the failure, put a breakpoint in your <br/>\napplication (System.in or something to that effect), and then fire up <br/>\nyour debugger and inspect the state of everything.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know that many people on this list (and Dave Astel&#39;s in his fine book) <br/>\nsay you shouldn&#39;t need the debugger if you TDD intensively enough.  I <br/>\nmyself am unfortunately not to that level yet, and I often find it <br/>\nuseful to fire up the debugger.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhatever approach you use, I think the general idea is to gradually <br/>\nnarrow down the scope of the unknown failure until you can see what is <br/>\nthe root cause.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope this helps,<br/>\nChad<br/>\n<br/>\nDavid Corbin wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; Prefectly reasonable suggestion.  I&#39;ll give it a try. For some reason, I <br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t think of asserts outside my tests.  (I&#39;m don&#39;t like the clutter).<br/>\n&gt; Chad Woolley wrote:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;Probably not the advice you want, but have you tried to use asserts to <br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;get more info?  Whatever the failure is, keep adding asserts about <br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;anything you can think of regarding the expected state of the app and <br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;objects under test.  Even (especially?) add ones for things you may <br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;think are obviously working correctly.  This may give you some clues to <br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;the problem.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;David Corbin wrote:<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I&#39;ve got one tests which fails sporadically, and I cannot figure out any <br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;reason for it to be non-deterministic in MY code.  I&#39;ve added some <br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;logging statements, but It&#39;s hard to get to fail. </span></blockquote></div>",
