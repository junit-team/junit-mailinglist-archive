IDEA ca=\r\nn run tests\nin a variety of ways, including all tests across all modules in=\r\n this\nproject (a project may have one or more modules).  That&#39;s how I\n*usua=\r\nlly* run my tests.  We also run our tests from Maven 2 (and\nsometimes Ant f=\r\nor older projects).\n\nI&#39;m now realizing that this is a trickier problem than=\r\n I originally\nthought.  It&#39;s made more complicated by the fact that most of=\r\n our\nprojects are multi-module.  For example, I tried cpsuite and it only\nf=\r\ninds tests in a single module.  While I could craft a negation to\nexclude &quot;=\r\n*OnlineTest&quot;, it wouldn&#39;t run all of the tests across\nmodules.  I looked at=\r\n JunitExt&#39;s Category and it seemed like it only\nprovided a way to organize =\r\nthe result of the tests, not filter which\ntests are executed (maybe I misse=\r\nd something).\n\nThinking out loud:\n\nFrom Ant and Maven, I can simply use fil=\r\nename inclusion/exclusion to\nexclude my &quot;Online&quot; tests.  The aggregation of=\r\n tests across modules is\nhandled by a parent script or pom.  All is general=\r\nly well from the\ncommand line (for now).\n\nFrom IDEA, I can use something li=\r\nke cpsuite (JUnit 4 tests) or JUnit\nAddons&#39; DirectorySuiteBuilder (JUnit 3 =\r\ntests).  But there&#39;s no way to\nrun all tests across all modules, excluding =\r\n&quot;*Online*&quot;, unless the\nJetBrains folks implement this feature\n(http://www.j=\r\netbrains.net/jira/browse/IDEA-13558).\n\nI&#39;m not entirely sure what Eclipse d=\r\noes to run tests across modules. \nI suspect it has similar limitations.\n\n**=\r\n Another take on describing an ideal\n\nI guess what I&#39;d find in an ideal wor=\r\nld is a way to optionally group\ntest classes (or specific tests) with a tex=\r\ntual group-name and then be\nable to pass one or more group-name to a test r=\r\nunner which would then\nexecute only the tests tagged appropriately.  The te=\r\nst runner would\nalso support negation so that you could express &quot;not online=\r\n tests&quot;.\n\nBoth the Eclipse and IDEA developers could enhance their test run=\r\nners\nto support execution filtering by group.  They would be able to\ncontin=\r\nue to provide their special &quot;run all tests across all modules&quot;\nfeature, and=\r\n it could apply the group filters across all modules.\n\n** Grouping by class=\r\n or string?\n\nI don&#39;t like the idea of specifying a group using a class beca=\r\nuse it\ndoesn&#39;t feel like a class to me.  It&#39;s meta-data not code; the fact\n=\r\nthat it&#39;s an empty class has a bit of a smell to me.  The thing I&#39;m\ndescrib=\r\ning really seems like it&#39;s a tag (ala flickr etc) that is used\nto organize =\r\ntests.  I like the fact that it&#39;s loose (as all tags are)\nso that you can e=\r\nstablish a convention across modules without having\nto share actual classes=\r\n.  If you want refactor-safety, you could\ncreate a static class with consta=\r\nnts (e.g. @Test(group =3D\nTestSuites.DATABASE)).  Users would have the opti=\r\non. \n\n\nSo, the thing I realized which is important is that what I&#39;m really\n=\r\nlooking for is tag/group support in the Eclipse and IDEA custom test\nrunner=\r\ns (sure, ant and maven would be nice too, it&#39;s secondary to me\nthough).  I =\r\ndon&#39;t see how a junit extension like cpsuite could solve\nthe &quot;all tests wit=\r\nh tag &#39;foo&#39; across all modules&quot; problem.  It&#39;s one\nlevel out from there (at=\r\n the junit ant task, maven surefire, idea, or\neclipse level).  The only way=\r\n eclipse/idea would support something\nlike this is if someone writes an ent=\r\nirely new test runner plugin\n(seems like a big waste of time) or if the gro=\r\nup/tag feature makes its\nway into junit core.  Then all of the various runn=\r\ners would likely\nbuild in support.\n\nSorry for the long winded message.  The=\r\nre are a few ideas in here. \nWhat do you think?\n\nChristian\n\n--- In junit@ya=\r\nhoogroups.com, &quot;David Saff&quot; &lt;saff@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Christian,\n&gt; \n&gt; Thank you=\r\n for the feature request.  Let&#39;s discuss further here, and\n&gt; then summarize=\r\n to the bug posting--I&#39;ve indicated as such to the\n&gt; tracker listing.\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\nJust to make sure I&#39;m hearing you right, it sounds like you were using\n&gt; a =\r\nmethod to run all the tests, without having to enumerate them\n&gt; individuall=\r\ny.  Is that right?  What were you using?  Eclipse?  Ant?\n&gt; \n&gt; It seems ther=\r\ne&#39;s two concerns you bring up, and JUnit doesn&#39;t handle\n&gt; either natively: =\r\nSuite construction (find all the tests I might want\n&gt; to run) and suite sub=\r\ndivision (only run the tests I actually want to\n&gt; run).\n&gt; \n&gt; *** Suite cons=\r\ntruction ***\n&gt; \n&gt; It&#39;s really important for me that it&#39;s clear how to run a=\r\nll my tests,\n&gt; so I&#39;ve often had to start with an AllTests suite from the v=\r\nery\n&gt; beginning.  Maintaining those suites can be annoying, so in some of m=\r\ny\n&gt; projects, I&#39;ve used Johannes Link&#39;s excellent ClasspathSuite:\n&gt; \n&gt; http=\r\n://www.johanneslink.net/cpsuite.html\n&gt; \n&gt; This allows me to run all tests i=\r\nn a package without having to\n&gt; enumerate them.  Eclipse and ant do this &quot;i=\r\nn the UI&quot;, but I prefer\n&gt; doing it in the suite definition itself, so other=\r\n developers can run\n&gt; my tests without matching the UI.\n&gt; \n&gt; *** Suite subd=\r\nivision\n&gt; \n&gt; Once we can find all the tests we might want to run, how do we=\r\n\n&gt; restrict which are actually run?  There are two out-of-the-box\n&gt; solutio=\r\nns I know of.\n&gt; \n&gt; First, I accomplish what you discuss through package org=\r\nanization: I\n&gt; can run test.unit.**, test.online.**, or test.** to get ever=\r\nything.\n&gt; This doesn&#39;t match every conceivable need, but it does match ever=\r\ny\n&gt; need I&#39;ve had so far.  Would it handle your current situation?\n&gt; \n&gt; Sec=\r\nond, JUnitExt claims to add a @Category annotation that does almost\n&gt; exact=\r\nly what you promise.  Would that handle your situation?  One\n&gt; thought I ha=\r\nve is that perhaps we&#39;d want to base groups on class\n&gt; names, so that autom=\r\nated refactoring can help if we decide to use a\n&gt; more informative name, an=\r\nd to provide an obvious place to document and\n&gt; extend a category definitio=\r\nn.  That is, rather than\n&gt; \n&gt; @Category(&quot;online tests&quot;) public class MyTest=\r\n {\n&gt; \n&gt; We could have\n&gt; \n&gt; @Category(OnlineTests.class) public class MyTest=\r\n {\n&gt; \n&gt; Or even just\n&gt; \n&gt; @OnlineTest public class MyTest {\n&gt; \n&gt; So, questi=\r\nons for the community:\n&gt; \n&gt; 1) Should something like ClasspathSuite be inco=\r\nrporated into JUnit?\n&gt; 2) Should something like JUnitExt&#39;s categories be in=\r\ncorporated into\nJUnit?\n&gt; 3) If yes to the above, what should the API look l=\r\nike?\n&gt; \n&gt; Remember that we strive to have JUnit be the intersection of all\n=\r\n&gt; useful testing frameworks, not their union.

The latest\nexample is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; w=\r\nith a client who has many unit style tests as well as a number of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; tes=\r\nts which require specific network connectivity only available\nfrom\n&gt; &gt; &gt; a =\r\nsubset of machines (the outgoing requests must come from a\nspecific\n&gt; &gt; &gt; i=\r\np address).  We call these the &quot;online tests&quot;.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; We want to be ab=\r\nle to group our tests into two groups, &quot;unit tests&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and &quot;online tests=\r\n&quot;.  In some case we want to run only &quot;unit\ntests&quot; or\n&gt; &gt; &gt; only &quot;online tes=\r\nts&quot;, and in other cases we want to run both (or\nall).\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I underst=\r\nand that this functionality is available using JUnit 4&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; &gt; @RunWith(Sui=\r\nte.class) and @SuiteClasses(TestClass1.class, ...).\n&gt; &gt; &gt; However, manually=\r\n adding test classes to a suite is clunky\nbecause the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; list of  test c=\r\nlasses becomes huge.  It&#39;s also error prone; it&#39;s\neasy\n&gt; &gt; &gt; for developers=\r\n to write a test but forget to add it to @SuiteClass.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Lastly, test ru=\r\nnners will run test in suites multiple times when\ntold\n&gt; &gt; &gt; to &quot;run all te=\r\nsts&quot;.  That&#39;s hardly the desired behavior.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; What I really would =\r\nlike to see is the concept of suite (or group in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; TestNG terms) be pro=\r\nmoted to a first class citizen.  Honestly, I\nthink\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  I would prefer it=\r\n to be at the test class level (unlike TestNG\nwhich\n&gt; &gt; &gt; is at the test me=\r\nthod level), since the mechanism should be used for\n&gt; &gt; &gt; high-level organi=\r\nzation IMHO.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Is there any chance something like this might make=\r\n its way into\nJUnit?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; What can I do to help?\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n Christian\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Yahoo!
