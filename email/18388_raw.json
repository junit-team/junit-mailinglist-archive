Thanks.\n&gt; \n&gt; You&#39;re welcome, and thank you for noting it. I know =\r\nit&#39;s a knotty \n&gt; problem to solve. I can&#39;t claim to know better, but I know=\r\n what I don&#39;t \n&gt; like, and I don&#39;t like this (quite). Of course, I&#39;m not ex=\r\nactly in \n&gt; Agitar&#39;s market for this product right now, so my opinion is la=\r\nrgely \n&gt; theoretical in nature at present.\n\nHi J.B.,\n\nAs Agitar&#39;s co-founde=\r\nr and CTO, I always hesitate to jump into product\ndiscussions in this forum=\r\n; but in this case it might be useful to\nclarify some things.  Especially s=\r\nince the discussion seems to be\nquite civilized so far :-).\n\n&gt;so my opinion=\r\n is largely \n&gt;theoretical in nature at present.\n\nThank you for recognizing =\r\nthat, but I can see how (based on the brief\ndescription of our pricing mode=\r\nl) you would reach your conclusions -\nso we have to fix that and be clearer=\r\n.\n\nIn practice, the number of classes on which the license is based is\nmeas=\r\nured more in orders or magnitudes than an very precise class\ncount.  Many o=\r\nf our licenses are actually enterprise-wide and for an\nunlimited number of =\r\nusers or classes.  In all cases, there is ample\nhead-room for adding new cl=\r\nasses and refactoring big-old-nasty\nclasses.  As a matter of fact, one of t=\r\nhe top uses for our JUnit\ngeneration is to help create a safety net for wor=\r\nking with legacy\ncode; and class/method refactoring is one of the things th=\r\nat we\nrecommend.  You can see me giving a demo of exactly that type of\nrefa=\r\nctoring (at the method level) at:\n\nhttp://www.agitar.com/solutions/products=\r\n/agitarone_demos.html\n\n(It&#39;s the first of the four mini-demos on that page =\r\n... No making fun\nof my accent please, and NO we did not hire Borat to do t=\r\nhe voice over\n:-)).\n\nEvery pricing scheme has advantages and disadvantages.=\r\n  Most of us\nwant to move away from per-seat licensing. I believe that a\nse=\r\nrver-based solution with an unlimited number of classes (or with a\nvery gen=\r\nerous over-allotment for growth and refactoring) is a step in\nthe right dir=\r\nection, but we are open to exploring other suggestions\n(like the one you al=\r\nready made).\n\nThanks,\n\nAlberto\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
