But with the skeleton of\n&gt; the application method in place, one can use the full power\n&gt; of the IDE. I&#39;m using JUnitDoclet together with IDEA.\n&gt;\n&gt; [lots of stuff about the IDE changing stuff you&#39;ve already written]\n\nI dunno. All of this stuff where you write a stub and then get the idea\nto edit the stub for you as you play with ideas seems like a lot of work\nto me, compared to just sketching out the ideas right into a unit test.\nEspecially since you still have to type out the stubs initially.\n\nWhy futz about with special tools when they&#39;re completely unnecessary?\nJust play about with your interface without any stubs at all, and write\nthem when you&#39;re happy with the bit of interface you&#39;ve designed.\n\nIn fact, I often &quot;test second&quot; in that the usually place I first write\nanything to do with a new class I&#39;m thinking of creating is in the\nclass that uses it. I just imagine that my new magic class exists\nand does what I need, and code that. Then I code up some unit tests\nthat parallel that, and then code the class itself. Works great, and\nsometimes complete classes appear and disappear in the caller before I\nreally work out what interface I need; it would be a waste of time to\ncreate stubs for a class and generate the test cases, only to delete all\nof that five minutes later.\n\nAlso, I find my test cases often don&#39;t parallel the particular methods\nof a class. They test the typical usage patterns of a class, instead. So\na test generator would just generate the wrong thing anyway.\n\nBut in the end, I guess you believe in test-first programming or you don&#39;t.\n\ncjs\n-- \nCurt Sampson  &lt;cjs@...&gt;   +81 90 7737 2974   http://www.netbsd.org\n    Don&#39;t you know, in this new Dark Age, we&#39;re all light.  --XTC\n\n\n",
