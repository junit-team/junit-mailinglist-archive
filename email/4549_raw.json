If I\n&gt; &gt; can&#39;t test something, the tool is telling me something about my design.\n&gt; &gt; I think that&#39;s a feature.\n&gt;\n&gt; While I agree in principle, default access methods are the ones that bug\n&gt; me.  I prefer to keep my tests in a separate hierarchy, and because of this\n&gt; I can&#39;t test methods with default access.  This means I&#39;m either forced to\n&gt; make things that would normally have package scope &quot;public&quot;, which is a bad\n&gt; solution, or put my tests in the package, which I don&#39;t like either.  This\n&gt; is why this notion is interesting to me.\n&gt;\n&gt; Take care,\n&gt; \tDale\n\nWhy don&#39;t you like keeping your tests in the same package scope, \nbut (optionally) in a physically separate directory ?  That&#39;s what we\ndo.  That&#39;s what I see most projects I&#39;ve worked with do.\n\n-- \nJohn Goodsen           RADSoft / Rapid Software Delivery Specialists\njgoodsen@...             eXtreme Java Internet Consultants\nhttp://www.radsoft.com           Toll Free: 866-RADSOFT (723-7638)\n\n",
