The reason I am going<br/>\nto all of this trouble to point out your various posts is to make it clear to<br/>\nyou that you can search the archives as well.  There is a wealth of knowledge<br/>\nthere!  Asking a question is never &quot;bad&quot; per se, it&#39;s just that it would be<br/>\nmore considerate of you to search the archives (and even the Wiki --<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?JavaUnit)\">http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?JavaUnit)</a> first, rather than reposting the same old<br/>\nquestions to the list every time.<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope you aren&#39;t offended by this, but rather that you take the opportunity to<br/>\nlearn how to more effectively use the list.
