The arbitrary depth and ability to create\n&gt; custom TestSuites and insert TestDecorators made writing runners\n&gt; difficult,\n&gt; especially re-run. Instead you now pass a flat array of test classes to\n&gt; JUnitCore to run a suite of tests. The RunListener doesn&#39;t currently\n&gt; provide\n&gt; notification when one of those classes starts and stops. I can imagine\n&gt; such\n&gt; notification might be useful, but I don&#39;t want to put it in without more\n&gt; justification than that. Can you distill your wishes into a test case?\n&gt;\n&gt; Sincerely yours,\n&gt;\n&gt; Kent Beck\n&gt; Three Rivers Institute\n\n\nKent,\n\nI didn&#39;t get the time I anticipated to look at this over the weekend, and\nthen I realised that two hours probably wasn&#39;t long enough to get up to\nspeed with Java 5 and the version 4 changes. I think your suggestion of\nwriting a test case would be the quickest way to work out whether this\nfeature is justifiable in the core implementation or whether I can distill\nit into something simpler, so I&#39;ll look to do that instead (using JUnit4,\nobviously!)\n\nThe removal of Composite is interesting. I was using it in my application\nthus, along with a custom runner:\n\n   - It is an application for functional testing of multi-channel\n   websites; i.e. WML, HTML, XHTML, XHTML MP, etc.\n    - For each response which comes back to the client, build up a\n   PageTestSuite composed of all the PageTestCase subclasses configured for\n   that device (user-agent).\n   - Run the PageTestSuite.\n\nI completely understand the problems caused by using Composite here. In my\napplication, the easiest way to re-run failed tests was to record them in a\nparticular format into a file and then use that file as the input to running\nthe application again. I think TestNG uses a similar mechanism.\n\nMy initial reasons for wanting this functionality included the fact that I\ndidn&#39;t want to have to walk the object model twice - once as the test runner\noperates and then again to build up a representation of how I want the\nresults to be displayed. I&#39;m not so sure about this now. I think I had too\ngreat an attachment to using Observer for this, which may be correct if you\ndon&#39;t have the entire object model in memory at one point; i.e. some sort of\nevent based thing would be required. I&#39;m leaning towards the viewpoint that\nthe representation of the results should just be a View on the results and\nshould be implemented however I want, which may include walking the object\nmodel twice. The problem that I&#39;m trying to decide on is what should be\nprovided to help construct this View. Thoughts welcome, along with\nsuggestions for different Views that you might want?\n\nRegards,\n\nJames\n\n\n&gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; &gt; From: junit@yahoogroups.com [mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com] On\n&gt; &gt; Behalf Of James Abley\n&gt; &gt; Sent: Thursday, October 13, 2005 1:08 PM\n&gt; &gt; To: junit@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; &gt; Subject: Re: [junit] Test Suites in HTML output\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; On 12/10/05, Kent Beck &lt;kentb@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; James,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; The current design provides testRunStarted(int count) and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; testRunFinished(Runner runner) notification to\n&gt; &gt; TestListeners. Is this\n&gt; &gt; &gt; sufficient for your purposes or do you need to be notified\n&gt; &gt; when a class&#39;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; tests are about to be run and have finished running?\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Sincerely yours,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Kent Beck\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Three Rivers Institute\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Hi Kent,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; That sounds promising, so I&#39;ll pull my finger out and take a\n&gt; &gt; more thorough\n&gt; &gt; look at the JUnit 4 source and Java 5 stuff this weekend and\n&gt; &gt; try to get a\n&gt; &gt; feel for it.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; My use case for JUnit 3 was to be notified when a TestSuite that I had\n&gt; &gt; created, rather than an implicit one that JUnit creates for\n&gt; &gt; you, was about\n&gt; &gt; to start processing and had finished processing. This nicely\n&gt; &gt; let me capture\n&gt; &gt; a hierarchical view of all the TestSuites that had run. I\n&gt; &gt; ended up modifying\n&gt; &gt; my TestRunner, since I had constant known case of always\n&gt; &gt; having the same\n&gt; &gt; level of nesting for my constructed TestSuites.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; A quick scan of the Version4 branch found the the note in the\n&gt; &gt; to-do.txt file\n&gt; &gt; about meeting the needs of runner developers! I appreciate\n&gt; &gt; that writing a\n&gt; &gt; TestRunner like this is a somewhat specialized activity\n&gt; &gt; versus everyday use,\n&gt; &gt; but was wondering if there has been any provision in JUnit 4\n&gt; &gt; for authors of\n&gt; &gt; TestRunners - could you provide any more detail about\n&gt; &gt; envisaged use cases?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; James\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ------------------------ Yahoo!
