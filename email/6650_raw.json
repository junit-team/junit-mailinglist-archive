But when \n&gt; I run it usi=\r\nng the swing gui (running from within idea) it \n&gt; comes up with the stack o=\r\nverflow error below. Normally my \n&gt; tests run fine in both ways.\n\nHello Mor=\r\nten,\n\nI&#39;m afraid I&#39;m not too familiar with this problem, however, I do have=\r\n\nthe feeling that I have read about this before.  I searched the archives\no=\r\nf this list, and Google, but to no avail (granted I haven&#39;t tried too\nhard)=\r\n.\n\nHere is what is tickling my brain:\n  I have the feeling that this is a c=\r\nlassloader issue, as is typical\nwith the JUnit Swing GUI.  You didn&#39;t menti=\r\non: whether it worked using\nthe AWT and Text Runners; nor which version of =\r\nJUnit you are using.\n\nHowever, in line with what I say above, there are two=\r\n potential\nproblems/solutions:\n- the first is more of a solution than a pro=\r\nblem, and has to do with the\nexcluded.properties file.  Check that an entry=\r\n for the XmlEncoder\npackage is in/out, and try adding/removing the entry.  =\r\nIt may create\nmore problems than it solves, but its worth a try.\n\n- the sec=\r\nond is more a problem than a solution: check that you do not\ninclude 2 vers=\r\nions of the XML libraries in the classpath.  This\nsometimes causes the Swin=\r\ng GUI to get its knickers in a twist.\n\nTry these out, and report back if su=\r\nccessful.\n\nManuel Amago.\nmailto:mamago@...\n\n\n",
