What&#39;s wrong with that suggestion?\n\nIt might help, but as with some other suggestions on this thread, I&#39;d \nconsider it more seriously if I&#39;d once actually encountered a project \nthat did it. It seems to me that techniques that so obscure they&#39;re only \nknown to the cognoscenti indicate there&#39;s something missing somewhere.\n\n&gt; You keep missing the distinction between &quot;public&quot; and &quot;published&quot;:\n&gt; &quot;published&quot; is a social convention enforced by social contracts.\n&gt; Providing a runtime JAR, to be available at _runtime_, and not\n&gt; _compile time_, is an excellent way of enforcing these conventions.\n\nI&#39;ve already argued this one to death in this thread; and don&#39;t have \nanything more to add at this point; but I will try to rephrase. There \nmay be a distinction between public and published in the original \ndeveloper&#39;s mind, but it starts and stops there. For the client \nprogrammer, public == published; and wishing otherwise ain&#39;t going to \nmake it so. The distinction that exists in Java is between public and \npackage-private. That&#39;s what you need to work with. Perhaps other \nlanguages have clearer distinctions between public and published, but \nJava doesn&#39;t.\n\n&gt; Similarly, excluding packages from JavaDoc works well.\n\nThat helps. Unlike runtime/API separation I&#39;ve actually seen this done. \nI&#39;d estimate I&#39;ve seen it about as frequently as I&#39;ve seen API docs that \ninclude package-private and private methods.  It would help more, if it \nwere more common. For instance, why are the junit.samples and \njunit.tests packages published in the JavaDoc on the JUnit web site at \nhttp://www.junit.org/junit/javadoc/3.8.1/index.htm ?\n\n-- \n﻿Elliotte Rusty Harold  elharo@...\nXML in a Nutshell 3rd Edition Just Published!\nhttp://www.cafeconleche.org/books/xian3/\nhttp://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0596007647/cafeaulaitA/ref=nosim\n\n",
