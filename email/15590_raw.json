I can keep fast feedback cycles while\nretaining high confidence levels. I can run all the unit tests related\nto the area I am working on plus all the fast unit tests for the entire\ncodebase plus a subset of other kinds of tests that I deem useful (possibly\nall the fast integration tests related to the area I am working in).\nThe &quot;area I am working in&quot; might be a module or package or some other slice\nof the codebase - ideally it will be easy for me to select something close\nto the relevant tests easily - so aggregating tests over packages or modules\nmight still be a very useful thing.\n\nI do think distinguishing different kinds of tests is useful. There are\ntests which check the environment (perhaps I would call the tableShouldExist\nexample below an environment test). There are some which might test your\nwiring if you are using IOC (you do test drive that don&#39;t you?) and there\nare others which test your system&#39;s building blocks (sometimes these are\ncalled integration or system tests - and sometimes they overlap with\nacceptance tests). If you are practising Agile then your unit tests are\nyour code-level documentation and specification and your system tests\nare your architectural-level documentation and specification.\n\nPaul.\n\n\nCédric Beust ♔ wrote:\n&gt; Integration and unit tests are actually not mutually exclusive with fast and\n&gt; slow tests.  Here is an example:\n&gt; \n&gt; @Test(groups = {&quot;fast&quot;, &quot;unit&quot;})\n&gt; public void fullName() {\n&gt;   Person p = new Person();\n&gt;   p.setFirstName(&quot;Cedric&quot;);\n&gt;   p.setLastName(&quot;Beust&quot;);\n&gt;   assert &quot;Cedric Beust&quot;.equals(p.getFullName());\n&gt; }\n&gt; \n&gt; @Test(groups = {&quot;slow&quot;, &quot;unit&quot;}}\n&gt; public void verifyPi() {\n&gt;   Pi pi = new Pi();\n&gt;   assert pi.getDecimals(10000).equals(EXPECTED_DECIMALS);\n&gt; }\n&gt; \n&gt; @Test(groups = {&quot;fast&quot;, &quot;integration&quot;})\n&gt; public void tableShouldExist() {\n&gt;   // verify that a table exists\n&gt; }\n&gt; \n&gt; @Test(groups = {&quot;slow&quot;, &quot;integration&quot;})\n&gt; public void insertGraphOfObjects() {\n&gt;   // insert a lot of rows in the database\n&gt; }\n&gt; \n&gt; With this set up, I have all freedom to run &quot;integration&quot;, &quot;unit&quot;, &quot;fast&quot; or\n&gt; &quot;slow&quot; tests.\n&gt; \n&gt; This is why trying to represent test groups with packages and class names\n&gt; doesn&#39;t scale:  test methods cannot belong to more than one group with that\n&gt; approach.\n&gt; \n&gt; --\n&gt; Cédric\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt; \n\n\n",
