I&#39;m not saying that we <br/>\ncan&#39;t test it as is, but I /am/ saying that if it were my code, I&#39;d look <br/>\nto change the design so that the tests don&#39;t depend on one another.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; It appears that a new object is created for each call to a test*<br/>\n&gt; method, so there&#39;s no object-local way to preserve state.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Right. At that point, you must do it through class-level data.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Is there any way to override this, making it call the test*<br/>\n&gt; methods all on the same object?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Not without rewriting the framework. The framework was written <br/>\n/expressly with the goal/ of isolating tests from one another. The <br/>\nframework achieves this by executing each test in its own instance of <br/>\nTest (or TestCase).<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; My reasoning is that if I write a test which creates, reads,<br/>\n&gt; and deletes the entry from the server, I&#39;m doing too much<br/>\n&gt; in a single test.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>A test consists of three parts: arrange, act, assert. You need to set up <br/>\nthe system in a desired, known state (arrange), do something of interest <br/>\n(act), then check the results (assert). You are right: your test is <br/>\ndoing too much, but I don&#39;t think the test is at fault.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; The only place that threading comes in is that I can&#39;t use a<br/>\n&gt; static value to keep this data, because then it&#39;s shared among<br/>\n&gt; all the threads.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t understand why you need multiple threads while running the <br/>\ntests. Could you run the tests in singlethreaded mode? The fact that you <br/>\nwant to test logic in multithreaded mode tells me that you may be trying <br/>\nto test too many things at once.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">  &gt; Any suggestions?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>What is your goal? To verify your logic? To test concurrency? At a <br/>\nminimum, do each of these separately, and not together.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; p.s.  Nope, no extensions yet, although I&#39;m eyeing TestResult<br/>\n&gt; as needing a touch of an upgrade...<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Interesting... do tell.<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJ. B.
