Just include them in the release.<br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">   &gt; Because we have a naming convention where every test <br/>\n  &gt; class name begins with<br/>\n  &gt; &quot;Test&quot;, it&#39;s also pretty easy to manipulate them when exporting.<br/>\n  &gt; Why hide the tests? I&#39;m proud of them! :) And I want them <br/>\n  &gt; to be seen right<br/>\n  &gt; aside the class they test, so it gives a visual clue that <br/>\n  &gt; they need to<br/>\n  &gt; follow the evolution of the class. Anyway.... :)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>&lt;/snip&gt;</div>",
