And to avoid, tight coupling I would like to avoid to hardcode in the ANT file which tests to enable/disable.<br/>\n<br/>\nIdeally I would like to define a custom attribute to my tests such as @RequireOnline and configure all the Junit runners (incl Parameterized) to filter out these tests based on my custom meta data on the test and the online/offline-state calculated at runtime.<br/>\n<br/>\nIs something like this possible?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\nMorten</div>",
