    "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1313598572\"><blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">&gt;One particular code smell I encounter frequently is when JUnit suites <br/>\n&gt;have lots (or any) System.out.println() statements. That normally <br/>\n&gt;indicates someone is trying to get more data out of JUnit tests than <br/>\n&gt;they&#39;re really intended to produce. It&#39;s even worse if these statements <br/>\n&gt;print when the tests are passing as well as failing. In this case, <br/>\n&gt;actual failures are likely to get swamped by the usual output and may <br/>\n&gt;well not be noticed, especially when running from Ant or the <br/>\n&gt;textui.TestRunner so there&#39;s no red bar. Honestly I think the standard <br/>\n&gt;Ant JUnit task produces too much output already. I only want to see <br/>\n&gt;tests that failed. I want line of output at most if all tests passed.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;-- <br/>\n&gt;Elliotte Rusty Harold  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:elharo@...\">elharo@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I appreciate the recent comments to my post, you all have given me good food<br/>\nfor thought, and I am coming around to the &quot;test everything reproducibly&quot;<br/>\npoint of view.<br/>\n<br/>\nI confess that I have some System.out.println() statements in my test cases.<br/>\nPartly it is to see which random cases were generated, and I see the point<br/>\nthat I shouldn&#39;t have to scan the output.  However, at least I&#39;m sure the<br/>\ntests are running the way I think they should be running!  I distrust<br/>\ncomputers and software greatly, so I&#39;m always trying to check up on what I<br/>\nthink is going on... this is doubly true when I&#39;m using new (for me)<br/>\nsoftware like Junit.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow do you Junit veterans assure yourself that a test is actually running<br/>\nand doing what it should be doing?<br/>\n<br/>\n--ErikN</div>",
