I&#39;ve implemented fsm&#39;s before, but never<br/>\n&gt; characterized a &quot;testable app&quot; as one that effectively *is* one.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I can&#39;t toot my own horn too loudly on this because Boris Beizer had a<br/>\nsimilar insight in his book &#39;Software Testing Techniques,&#39; but we arrived at<br/>\nit independently.  Finding his discussion of testability in relation to<br/>\nFSM&#39;s gave me confidence to say what I thought.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think the FSM is a fruitful source of ideas about what testability<br/>\nentails.  I also think it well-describes the end product of a religiously<br/>\ndeveloped TDD application.  That is, everything is clean, tight, purposeful<br/>\nand geared toward producing the right output at every step of the way.<br/>\n<br/>\nSince I&#39;ve begun thinking about this I&#39;ve scoured all the books I have and<br/>\ncould find at the local Borders and Barnes & Noble, and have mostly come<br/>\nacross pretty shallow treatments of testability in software testing and<br/>\nengineering books.  Beizer&#39;s is by far the best example, where he discusses<br/>\ntestability in several places with specifics.  Of course Kent Beck&#39;s and<br/>\nRobert Martin&#39;s books have a lot of insights and relevance for testability,<br/>\nbut the word itself is almost never, if ever, used or analyzed.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was disappointed to see the new book &#39;Testing Extreme Programming&#39; had a<br/>\ncouple of pages of fluff dedicated to the topic of &quot;testability.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Note:<br/>\n&gt; Here, I find that I need an example to follow the discussion.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I am now working on some examples.  I need them myself to better generalize<br/>\nwhat the real principles are and see how apt this FSM idea is.<br/>\n<br/>\nScott S.</div>",
