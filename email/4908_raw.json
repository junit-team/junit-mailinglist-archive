(Besides, this isn&#39;t really a JUnit question.)\n\n&gt; Now my test methods get quite large. &lt;snip /&gt;\n\nFirst question: is there much raw code duplication in these tests? Start with \nduplication within a single test method -- does removing duplication make the \ntest smaller or simpler? Next look at duplication in a collection of test \nmethods -- can you factor out duplication from four or five test methods? If \nso, does that make the tests smaller?\n\nNext question: is there conceptual duplication in these tests? Do tests A, B \nand C make essentially the same assertions? You may think you&#39;re being \nthorough, but you may be doing too much by asserting the same things in a \nnumber of tests. I&#39;ve done this and I&#39;m learning to identify and challenge \nit. Trying moving the duplicated assertions to one test and let the others \nsimply assert on what&#39;s different, rather than the same old thing.\n\n&gt; Would you rely on some orientation of created tiles, e.g. assume the \n&gt; left turning road is always constructed as from east turning to south \n&gt; (maybe this is like the Blackbox / Whitebox discussion)?\n\nPerhaps this will help get you going until you think of something better. \nSometimes you have to make assumptions to make the tests workable in size and \nscope. If you have one test that shows that it doesn&#39;t matter which \norientation the left-turning road has, then for the remaining tests, one left-\nturning road is as good as another. If that changes, though, then you have to \nremember: aha! The south-to-west road might behave differently! I should add \na test!\n\n&gt; Would you even allow incomplete tests (not testing what is &quot;most \n&gt; likely working&quot;, e.g. assuming a tile does not have special items)?\n\nTest until fear turns to boredom. :)\n\n--\nJ.
