A test doesn&#39;t depend upon the\nside effects of a run of another, but (at some user determined level) the\nrun of one test ought depend upon the completion of and success of another.\n\n&gt;\tWhen I wrote a few examples, I found that when one test depends on another\n(in your sense) there is\n&gt;\tduplication in the tests. At a minimum, the two tests make the same\nassertions.\n\nOk, another example. I have a class that walks a classpath and generates\nlistener events on things found, I test that. I have a class that listens to\nsuch events to &quot;find&quot; things that match a certain criterion, I test that. If\nthe first class fails to send events, then I ought not blame (or dig into)\nthe second for not finding anything. The tests are (I believe) unit tests of\neach, without duplication.\n\n&gt;\tThe closer an object is to the core of your application, the more\nimportant (I think) that failures in that &gt;\tobject yell loudly and\nannoyingly.\n\nIf one is goign to test, then any single test failing is loud enough. Why\nget 50 random reports when one focused one would do?\n\n&gt;\tIf your project has a big problem with core classes failing on a regular\n&gt;\tbasis, then maybe you have a process/people problem, as opposed to a\ntechnical problem.\n\nSo junit is for folks who don&#39;t really need good testing? ;-)\n\nregards\n\nAdam\n\n\n\n",
