Just a thought.\n\nI do java almost daily and all the java I ever did was test first (only two\nyears now). I love it and I realy wouldn&#39;t know where to start coding if I\ndidn&#39;t have my test first.\n\nWhen I started java and test first I loved to see the green bar. A good way\nto end the day was to see that green bar (I mainly used the GUI version\nthen). Going home (or to another task) with all tests running 100% was a\nrealy good feeling.\n\nAs time has gone, I&#39;ve interestingly found that going home with a few\nfailing tests shortly after having had all tests pass is an even bester way\nto end the day. &quot;Picking-up-time&quot; is much shorter when I arrive in the\nmorning or when I pick up the project after having worked on something else\nfor a while. There is no need to take notes to avoid the &quot;where did I get\nto&quot;. The failing tests take my thoughts right to the place they were when I\nleft off. I even find that when I do this I better &quot;let go&quot; of my project\nwhen I&#39;m not working on it.\n\nSo my tip, end the day in fresh red.\n\nMorten\n\n\n",
