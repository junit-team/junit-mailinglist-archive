    "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-504567082\">Somehow, I was under the impression that each test<br/>\nin a test case started with a &quot;clean slate&quot; -- that the<br/>\nsetup code was re-run for each test method.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut that doesn&#39;t appear to be the case. The test object<br/>\ncreated during setup turned out to be reused for<br/>\nsubsequent tests in the test case, which caused problems<br/>\narising from old state, until I figured it out.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, for performance, it only makes sense that a fixture<br/>\nwould be reused for each test in a test case class. So I&#39;m<br/>\nnot suggesting that the implementation is wrong.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut I read the docs at the main site, and I&#39;ve been following<br/>\nthese threads for quite a while, and still I had a dead-wrong<br/>\nimpression of what&#39;s going on.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor example, in the FAQ, q2 &quot;How do I use a text fixture?&quot;<br/>\nsays:<br/>\n   &quot;Each test runs in its own test fixture to isolate tests from the<br/>\n   changes made by other tests. Because the tests are isolated,<br/>\n   they can be run in any order.... The JUnit framework<br/>\n   automatically invokes the setUp() method before each test is<br/>\n   run and the tearDown() method after each test is run.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nNow for &quot;test&quot;, I was reading &quot;test *method*&quot;. As in testX(),<br/>\ntestY(). But my recent epiphany suggests that I should have<br/>\nbeen reading it as &quot;test *case*&quot;, as in &quot;test-case class&quot;. And<br/>\nsince the example shows a single test case class, with multiple<br/>\ntest methods in it, it was easy to make that assumption.<br/>\n<br/>\nNote:<br/>\nIn general, I&#39;m not much fond of the name, &quot;TestCase&quot;, because<br/>\nto me that represents a single test. Since a TestCase class can<br/>\nactually have multiple test methods, the name &quot;TestFixture&quot; is<br/>\nprobably more appropriate. But be that as it may...<br/>\n<br/>\nIt appears to me that the word &quot;test&quot; is badly overloaded in the<br/>\ndocs, meaning at various times, test method, test case, and<br/>\npotentially even test suite.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe best way to eliminate confusion that I can see is to do a<br/>\nglobal search on &quot;test &quot;, and replace with one of the hyphenated<br/>\nwords &quot;test-method&quot;, &quot;test-case&quot;, or &quot;test-suite&quot;, as appropriate.</div>",
