I know, I know... if I don&#39;t like it I should do \n&gt; better... Well, I&#39;ve only been using J/Unit for a couple of days now \n&gt; so I&#39;m not prepared yet to write docs.\n\n\n- documentation sucks: +1\n- since you&#39;re new to the product, you cannot write documentation: -1\n\nYou can write/update documentation about:\n- how to install JUnit (with/without ant, classpath problems, solutions...)\n- how to verify your installation\n- how to write your first tests\n- how to organize your tests\n\nI know that a lot of different and excellent articles exist about these \nsubjects but if you still have &quot;newbie&quot; questions on the newsgroup it \nmeans either:\n- users don&#39;t read the documentation\nor\n- the documentation is not good enough.\n\nI really think that a product downloaded more than 150,000 times should \nhave a better documentation/community.\n\n-Vladimir\n\n-- \nVladimir Bossicard\nwww.bossicard.com\n\n\n",
