    "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1761879700\">Hi, relative newbie to junit and logging here.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am using this diasparsoftToolkit and it has some nice features (this came<br/>\nout of reading the junit recipies book<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1932394230\">http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1932394230</a> - this is a really good<br/>\nbook). The logging in the test cases is easy if you inherit from their abc,<br/>\nit&#39;s just info(...), warn(...), etc. and there is other good stuff like<br/>\npartially ordered tests and closure exceptions. But there may be other<br/>\nthings out there that I don&#39;t know about (fitness?)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe consensus seems to be that jdk logging sucks big time (seems fine to me<br/>\nthough at first blush)) and one should therefore use<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/logging/\">http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/logging/</a> as it wraps log4j and jdk. <br/>\n<br/>\nI also have to deal with webmacro and it&#39;s logging.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy first priority is doing the architecture for testing in a good way, so<br/>\nwhat do you guys think about this diasparsoft stuff? Have you found<br/>\nsomething better or equal but different? (I am introducing junit into a<br/>\nsmall .bomb that is not terribly agile (i.e. *no* tests) and has lot&#39;s of<br/>\nyour typical many kloc servlets. So I can&#39;t get too carried away, but I<br/>\nwould like to have some of the helper stuff in junit in whatever I can foist<br/>\nupon them).<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter that, does the commons logging seem best and has anyone used it with<br/>\nwebmacro? Or should I byte the bullet and say jdk all the way?<br/>\n<br/>\nAny pointers will be appreciated.<br/>\n<br/>\nthanks <br/>\n---<br/>\nray tayek &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://tayek.com/\">http://tayek.com/</a>&gt;, co-chair &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ocjug.org/\">http://www.ocjug.org/</a>&gt;, actively <br/>\nseeking telecommuting work.</div>",
