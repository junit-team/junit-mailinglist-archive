Rainsberger\n  Sent: Saturday, January 21, 2006 9:04 PM\n  To: junit@yahoogroups.com\n  Subject: Re: [junit] Thanks - running out of memory\n\n\n  Robert Lucente wrote:\n  &gt; Thanks for the help.\n  &gt;\n  &gt; I am a newbie to Java/JUnit. I am going to begin by examining the\nsuggestion\n  &gt; in Friday, January 20, 2006 1:41 PM about setUp/tearDown.\n  &gt;\n  &gt; &quot;rarely the best one&quot;\n  &gt;\n  &gt; It all depend on how you define &quot;best&quot;.\n  &gt;\n  &gt; If I am running tests on my PC and don&#39;t have a lot of time to delve\ninto\n  &gt; the memory problem, why not add that 1 GB of memory to the PC and meet\nthe\n  &gt; deliverable date ?\n\n  This is precisely the kind of thinking that leads to dissatisfied\n  customers. Are /they/ going to just pop in 1 GB RAM to run your\n  software? A memory problem in testing often means a memory problem in\n  the production code.\n\n  &gt; If this is an exercise to learn the technology, then I would investigate\n  &gt; setUp/tearDown, lazy loading and so on.\n\n  I think it&#39;s one of our basic responsibilities as programmers to take\n  reasonable precautions against writing software that arbitrarily sucks\n  up large amounts of memory. I assume, of course, that we intend our\n  customers to let our software run for days, weeks, months at a time.\n  --\n  J. B.
