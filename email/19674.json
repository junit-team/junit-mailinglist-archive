In teams of dozens of<br/>\n&gt;  programmers of various age and seniority levels scattered over<br/>\n&gt;  multiple time zones, mentoring and diagrams only go so far.  The only<br/>\n&gt;  way to guarantee that things don&#39;t break is to leverage your<br/>\n&gt;  programming language to make sure that any infraction will simply not<br/>\n&gt;  compile.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>...<br/>\n<br/>\nI agree, the larger the teams and the less skilled the personnel the<br/>\nmore effort you have to spend ensuring that architectural constraints<br/>\nare maintained, the more time needs to be spent on communication and<br/>\nknowledge sharing and the slower the communication has to be.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, relying on the compiler to *enforce* constraints is not, in<br/>\nmy experience, the answer because it requires developers to have a<br/>\ngood understanding of the language semantics, not write poor code and<br/>\nnot just change the code to work around what they see as barriers in<br/>\nthe way of their work.  Which requires good developers in the first<br/>\nplace, who don&#39;t need to be constrained.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor example, the Singleton pattern cannot be implemented in Java yet<br/>\nI&#39;ve seen teams try anyway, attempt to apply C++ idioms to Java code,<br/>\nand then wonder why their code doesn&#39;t work when run in a container.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn my experience, it&#39;s better to use the language to *encourage* good<br/>\npractice. That is, provide code that makes it easier to do the right<br/>\nthing than the wrong thing -- programmers are lazy by nature.<br/>\n&quot;Dependency Injection&quot; is a good example.  If the system is written in<br/>\na good DI  style then the code exposes dependencies between decoupled<br/>\nobjects and singletons are not necessary.  The &quot;just create one&quot;<br/>\npattern works fine because it takes less code to wire a new object<br/>\ninto the right part of the object graph than it does to write a<br/>\nsingleton class.</div>",
