I&#39;m a 16-year-old high school student at Troy<br/>\n&gt; High School, in Fullerton, CA (Class of &#39;05).  Over the past half-<br/>\n&gt; year or so, I have been working with my AP Computer Science teacher,<br/>\n&gt; Dave Wittry, on a project to make JUnit testing more accessible to<br/>\n&gt; both teachers and students called JAM*Tester (JUnit Auto-Matic<br/>\n&gt; Tester).<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Hi, David. I just looked at the Student Demo, and I would like to <br/>\ncommend you and your team on a very neat project. You have done free of <br/>\ncharge part of what Parasoft has done (with JTest), charging thousands <br/>\nof dollars. (This is not a slight on Parasoft... I&#39;m just noting the <br/>\ncomparison. Obviously, Parasoft&#39;s JTest does much more than JAM*Tester <br/>\ndoes. Don&#39;t send any cards and letters.)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe technique that JAM*Tester uses is similar to the &quot;Gold Master&quot; <br/>\ntechnique, which involves observing what the code does, then pasting its <br/>\nactual behavior into a test, with the idea of verifying that the code <br/>\ncontinues to do (in the future) what it does now. It also does part of <br/>\nwhat Agitar&#39;s Agitator product does: suggest a series of tests, based on <br/>\na structural analysis of the code.<br/>\n<br/>\nSince you&#39;re obviously a bright programming student, I have a homework <br/>\nquestion for you. (My wife is a tutor, and I get to help out, so I&#39;m <br/>\nvery used to giving homework.) If you could wave a wand and add three <br/>\nfeatures to JAM*Tester, which features would you choose? Defend your <br/>\nanswer. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nCongratulations. It&#39;s very nice work.<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJ. B.
