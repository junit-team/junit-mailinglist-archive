I didn&#39;t have my coffee yet :-)\n\n&gt; As a concrete example I am currently working on a a templated\n&gt; code generator implemented as a Javadoc DocLet. So I run Javadoc\n&gt;, giving it the classname of the doclet and the name\n&gt; of the code template, and the doclet takes the supplied class\n&gt; information from Javadoc and produces an output file according to the\n&gt; template&#39;s instructions. It is a simple program, using the reflection\n&gt; API and the doclet API to do most of the work.\n\nNot having an idea about doclets, I don&#39;t know if the following is\napplicable\n\n&gt; Most of the 9 classes can be quickly and cleanly unit tested\n&gt; with little work. But the overall transformation from Template\n&gt; to generated code also needs to be unit testable for refactoring\n&gt; and maintainence reasons.\n\nFor simplicity, let&#39;s assume that work is done in a class called\nTransformer...\n\n&gt; As far as I can tell, I need a standard &quot;oracular&quot; or dummy doclet\n&gt; information provider to act as the source of class information and\n&gt; a standard template to test as well as\n&gt; a piece of transformed output to verify against.\n\n&gt; The template and canonical output could be embedded as strings in the\n&gt; program itself.\n\n&gt; But the transformed text (going out via a PrintWriter class)\n&gt; I believe is only accessible as a file.\n\nSo, basically, you have something like\nTransformer.DoTransform(DocletInfoProvider info,String template,PrintWriter\nout)\n\nIgnore the first two parameters... the PrintWriter is the important part\n\n&gt; Am I wrong ? Can I restructure this so that it is\n&gt; unit testable writing to and from buffers and still manageable\n&gt; as a file output type of tool ?\n\nIf you pass the PrintWriter in, this is directly unit testable.\n\nSet up a PrintWriter like this:\n\n\t// ... set up Doclet info provider and template\n\n\t// set up print writer\n\tByteArrayOutputStream\tstream = new ByteArrayOutputStream;\t//\nGet an output stream to hold the results\n\tPrintWriter out=new PrintWriter(stream);\t\t// all\noutput ends up in stream\n\n\t// call your method\n\tTransformer.DoTransform(info,template,out);\n\n\t// Now, stream should contain the expected result\n\tassertEquals(expectedOutputString,stream.toString());\n\n\nThat should do the trick...\n\n&gt; &gt;One of the benefits you reap if you implement your classes\n&gt; that way is that\n&gt; &gt;you can add MD5 checksums, compression, etc without any\n&gt; redesign. If your\n&gt; &gt;class is writing directly to a file, you would have to\n&gt; modify that class to\n&gt; &gt;achieve the same.\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;Of course, that&#39;s only a guess - I could be completely off :-)\n&gt;\n&gt; I think it is clear from my question above that I lack an\n&gt; understanding of\n&gt; how\n&gt; this would be achieved within the Javba I/O library.\n\nCompression and checksums? Checksums are implemented by CheckedOutputStream.\nCompression is a ZipOutputStream. They all inherit from FilterOutputStream.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Awaiting your response with baited breath\n\nHopefully I could answer your question. If that&#39;s not what you were looking\nfor, I&#39;m probably misunderstanding your problem.\n\nBye,\n  Robert\n\nPlease be aware that messages sent over the Internet may not be secure and\nshould not be seen as forming a legally binding contract unless otherwise\nstated.
