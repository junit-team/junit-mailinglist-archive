We can have a side discussion on the merits of that, but it&#39;s a fact. We have right now around 60 developers working across 10 projects. All 10 projects share a common architecture and supporting components. I&#39;d guess we have around 7000 unit tests across the 10 projects. Our coverage is a bit lacking but I know it&#39;s helped.\n \nHere are 2 situations where we&#39;d use this:\n \n \nSituation 1:\nSome of our tests acquire information from external systems we do not have control over. Those systems sometimes go through maintenance for a day or two or sometimes those systems clear out all of the test data and repopulate (I hate that we cannot own a part of the test data, but it&#39;s been a political issue for 3 years). When this happens, we need to update tests. It usually takes a 1 to 3 days to do that - often the information the test uses is externalized, we still have to find appropriate replacement keys. So we don&#39;t actually update the test, we update the data driven part of the tests. While that happens, other development would lose out on CI or we&#39;d have to disable those tests. It&#39;d be nice to just put a 3-day delay on them. Then they&#39;d start running again automatically. So I guess the ignore is until a date and after that the test continues to run.\n\nSituation 2:\nI&#39;m working on something in the trunk. I want to write tests and check in my work. I could work in a branch, check in all I want and then make sure to merge that branch back into the trunk. However, if I do that, I have to keep the branch up to date with the trunk and vice versa - merging in both directions. This is a pain. So I&#39;d rather just write several tests. Put on the ignore, check them in. Then take out the ignore while I continue my development (better yet, maybe I could set some environment variable when executing tests to ignore the ignore!-).\n \nWe have a utility class called TimeBomb (we&#39;re still using JUnit 3.8.1). When we want to disable a test, we put a time bomb in the test. That test will eventually start to ACTIVELY fail in the near future. Here&#39;s an example from something else I&#39;m working on, on the side: http://schuchert.wikispaces.com/JUnit+4.x#TimeBomb\n \nBrett\n----- Original Message ----\nFrom: Joakim Ohlrogge &lt;joakim.ohlrogge@...&gt;\nTo: junit@yahoogroups.com\nSent: Thursday, June 8, 2006 6:09:54 AM\nSubject: Re: [junit] @Ignore with a time\n\n\nI think that would address my concern that @ignore can be forgotten.\nA failing test would be a really nice reminder: &quot;ignore expired: &lt;your\nmessage&gt;&quot;\nI have not yet used ignore I have not seen the need, when do you typically\nneed it?\n\nOn 6/8/06, Brett L. Schuchert &lt;schuchert@yahoo. com&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;ve been working with a group for the past 3.5 years and we&#39;ve been\n&gt; using JUnit from the beginning. A while back, as the project grew,\n&gt; there were times when we would break tests (or because we had\n&gt; external dependencies that we had to wait and had not yet mocked\n&gt; things out), tests would fail for a few days before we could get to\n&gt; them.\n&gt;\n&gt; This stopped our CI, so we introduced a helper class, TimeBomb. We&#39;d\n&gt; add a call to TimeBomb with a date and the test would stop failing\n&gt; until after the provided date.\n&gt;\n&gt; It was an active way to remind us go back and fix something in a few\n&gt; days.\n&gt;\n&gt; @Ignore has a message. What about adding a date? Ignore until the\n&gt; date, after which the test will fail by throwing a runtime exception?\n&gt;\n&gt; Is that crazy?\n&gt;\n&gt; Brett\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt;\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n \n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\n\n\n",
