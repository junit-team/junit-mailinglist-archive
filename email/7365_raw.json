Since we currently have more than 500 test cases it is \n&gt; difficult to do this manually. It would of course be easy if the \n&gt; normal success rate was 100%, but a number of test cases fail since \n&gt; the implementation is not yet completed. \n\nI simply keep two kind of tests in separate directories of my source \ntree. One kind is testing existing completed code, which should \nalways pass 100%. Another kind of tests are for not yet written code \nor not yet implemented behaviour. Those should fail, but less and \nless as you move more tests from failed category to completed. You \ncan watch the number of tests failing from release to release.\n\n\n\n\n\n",
