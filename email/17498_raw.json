That&#39;s like making your tech support user friendly by outsourcing\n&gt; it to trained professionasl in India rather than letting your clients\n&gt; talk directly to the developers. There&#39;s a ton of theory (i.e.\n&gt; rationalizations) to support doing that, and it&#39;s completely\n&gt; counterproductive in practice.\n\nI&#39;m unsure about that analogy. If the trained professionals in India \nprovided the same experience as talking directly to programmers, then it \nwould be just fine. Obviously, that doesn&#39;t happen, but I can implement \nan interface two different ways to provide experiences similar enough \nthat the client can&#39;t tell the difference. (Example: XStream object \nstorage compared to a relational database.)\n\n&gt; Interfaces are very popular among the most theoretical programmers: i.e.\n&gt; exactly the sort of programmers who are likely to write books, read\n&gt; books about OO theory, and hang out on lists like this one.\n\nI find it difficult not to interpret this as a (very mild) personal \nattack. You seem to imply that we are not also practitioners. I suspect \nyou&#39;re not an asshole, so I imagine you mean something else. I would \nappreciate you clarifying this position. Is it necessarily the case, \nthen, that &quot;the sort of programmers who... hang out on lists like this \none&quot; don&#39;t know what we&#39;re talking about, because I kinda think I do and \nI kinda think I&#39;ve proven that.\n\n&gt; However in\n&gt; my experience concrete classes are much simpler and much preferred by\n&gt; the vast majority of pragmatic programmers just getting their jobs done.\n&gt; \n&gt; I can certainly see how making a class test-friendly could make it less\n&gt; caller-friendly. In fact, exactly how to do that is the subject of\n&gt; another perma-thread on this list. exposing methods purely for the\n&gt; convenience of testers expands a class&#39;s interface and makes it harder\n&gt; to learn, use, and understand. Minimal interfaces are simpler to\n&gt; understand and learn. Exposing additional methods purely for test\n&gt; convenience is very counter-productive to caller-convenience. The only\n&gt; public parts of a class&#39;s interface should be things that are relevant\n&gt; to client programmers.\n\nYou&#39;re trivially right, in the sense that 39124 &gt; 39123. Like anything \nelse, done badly, the result is bad; but done well, the result is just \nfine. If I add a few methods just for testing, then that exposes a \nmissing abstraction, it&#39;s also likely that we can /simplify/ the design \nby reducing the average cognitive load per class/interface/unit.\n\nI would love the opportunity to pair with you to see what you do \ndifferently than I do. I know there&#39;s an opportunity to learn there.\n-- \nJ. B.
