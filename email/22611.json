I have come across the documentation at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.junit.org/apidocs/org/junit/runner/manipulation/Sorter.html\">http://www.junit.org/apidocs/org/junit/runner/manipulation/Sorter.html</a> but it doesn&#39;t fully describe how to use it.  I don&#39;t see a sort annotation, and I was hoping you didn&#39;t have to extend the Suite class, overload all of the constructors, and then call the sort method.  The documentation points to a Request.sortWith(Comparator) method, but how do I intercept my Suite and call that method when running the tests through Ant, Mvn, or an eclipse JUnit execution?  <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m aware JUnit tests are unit tests that shouldn&#39;t need to be ordered, but we have a fairly heavy handed set of side effects produced on win32 that I&#39;m trying to automate using JUnit.  My only other option is to use TestNG, but I&#39;m trying to standardize on JUnit.  Any and all tips, even if you&#39;re pointing me to the right documentation is GREATLY appreciated!</div>",
