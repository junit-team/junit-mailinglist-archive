More precisely, all work<br/>\n&gt; that can be done by Parameterized runner can be done by Theories<br/>\n&gt; runner. I think it should be consider to refactor their<br/>\n&gt; implementations and to write more documentation about use of Theories. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>-- <br/>\nView this message in context: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.nabble.com/Parameterized-and-Theories-overlaps-tp16004982p20029916.html\">http://www.nabble.com/Parameterized-and-Theories-overlaps-tp16004982p20029916.html</a><br/>\nSent from the JUnit - User mailing list archive at Nabble.com.</div>",
