B. (Joe) Rainsberger said, &quot;do not test what cannot possibly break.&quot;\n&gt; so you don&#39;t\n&gt; really need to test the simple set/get combination. But by the same token,\n&gt; make sure\n&gt; that you really need the simple set/get combination. Don&#39;t add them simply\n&gt; because you\n&gt; think you might need them someday. Add them because a test you are writing\n&gt; shows a need\n&gt; for them.\n&gt; \n&gt; Erik Husby\n&gt; Phase Forward Incorporated\n&gt; 1440 Main Street\n&gt; Waltham, MA 02451-1623 USA \n&gt; 781-902-4559\n&gt; erik.husby@...\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
