So the problem\nhere might be just that it is a different version.\n\nA simple and straightforward solution is to configure JBuilder to use\nwhichever JDK you are using with the ant and standard JDK.  You can do\nthat through Tools --&gt; Configure JDKs.\n\nThat is what I am doing because of some known locale issue with JDK\n1.3.0 bundled with JBuilder.\n\n\n--\nDisclaimer:  I join all the news groups out of my own interest.

We got odd errors when we\n&gt;      tried to run code together that had been compiled\n&gt;      differently.  Apparently, JBuilder uses its own internal JDK\n&gt;      which is not 100% the same as the standard.  It would not\n&gt;      surprise me if VisualCafe did something similar.Your best\n&gt;      bet is probably to standardize on one or the other - either\n&gt;      compile and run everything from inside of Visual Cafe, or\n&gt;      use it only as your editor and instead use ant (or make, or\n&gt;      whatever) to build and run.\n&gt;      -----Original Message-----\n&gt;      From: David Roussel [mailto:dir@...]\n&gt;      Sent: Wednesday, September 05, 2001 6:28 AM\n&gt;      To: junit@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;      Subject: RE: [junit] JUnit3.7 Error message\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;           Sorry Pank I don&#39;t know the solution to you\n&gt;           problem.  However I used to use VisualCafe 4 and\n&gt;           now I have moved to Ant, Jikes and a text editor I\n&gt;           suffer less stress.\n&gt;           -----Original Message-----\n&gt;           From: Pankaj Solanki [mailto:psolanki@...]\n&gt;           Sent: 05 September 2001 14:18\n&gt;           To: junit@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;           Subject: [junit] JUnit3.7 Error message\n&gt;\n&gt;           Hi all, Will any of you plz assess, why my\n&gt;           SimpleTest.java file is failing : The problem I am\n&gt;           facing is: When I compile a junit test file thru&#39;\n&gt;           VisualCafe4.0, it gets compiled without any\n&gt;           error.Later while invoking the TestRunner utility\n&gt;           from console (any approach - textui, awtui or\n&gt;           swingui),I am getting following error\n&gt;           message: java.lang.IncompatibleClassChangeError:\n&gt;           junit.framework.Assert: method\n&gt;           assert(Ljava/lang/String;Z)V did not used to be\n&gt;           static  at\n&gt;           junit.samples.SimpleTest.testAdd(SimpleTest.java:32)But\n&gt;           surprisingly if I compile the same file from\n&gt;           console and run the TestRunner utility then test\n&gt;           passes without any error and it show a green bar.\n&gt;           Perfect run. My VisualCafe4.0 setting is fine\n&gt;           (junit.jar and the directory which contain this\n&gt;           jar file is included in the classpath of sc.ini\n&gt;           file).
