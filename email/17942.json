    "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1759677027\">Cedric,<br/>\n<br/>\nAppreciate your reference to &quot;migration&quot; as one of the (cost) <br/>\ncomponents of technology change.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen performing a cost/benefit analysis the availability of a <br/>\nthoughtful (well-engineered) migration strategy certainly helps <br/>\nreduce the &quot;cost&quot;.  (It would not be considered a benefit - since <br/>\nmigration is fundamentally a &quot;cost&quot; component.) <br/>\n<br/>\nAnother often overlooked cost component is &quot;legal&quot;.  It was <br/>\ninteresting to consult at one recent company and note they  <br/>\nconsidered themselves indemnified for using JDK 1.3 by virtue of its <br/>\ndistribution with their licensed Application Server and IDE <br/>\nenvironment.  In other words, you were not authorized to use a v. <br/>\n1.3 JDK other than the one distributed with the licensed IDE <br/>\ninstalled by their infrastructure support team on your desktop.<br/>\n<br/>\n(Note: The same was true for JUnit and Struts.  Since JUnit/Struts <br/>\nwas distributed by the licensed vendor with the IDE it could be <br/>\nused.  No upgrades allowed!)<br/>\n<br/>\n*** End of Response ***  ... Opinions follow.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile thinking more about JavaDoc annotations; it seems (to me) <br/>\nthere is a fundamental contextual difference between using an <br/>\nannotation as a &quot;marker&quot; (@deprecated with JDK or @excludeClass with <br/>\nTestUtil) to be interpreted outside of method invocation and using a <br/>\nJavaDoc annotation to alter runtime execution.  (This might be <br/>\nconsidered similar to the distinction between using an Interface as <br/>\na loosely-coupled marker [to overcome single-class inheritance] vs. <br/>\nan Interface to force tight [fragile] coupling between artifacts.)<br/>\n<br/>\nSo - what I&#39;m having trouble cost justifying is introducing a <br/>\nruntime influencing technology that simply is a stylistic <br/>\nprogramming change - from &quot;test&quot; to &quot;@Test&quot;.  There is no value-add <br/>\nhere.  Right?  No additional value to customers and no additional <br/>\nvalue to developers.  It is simply style.<br/>\n<br/>\nOr, am I fundamentally missing something.<br/>\n<br/>\n_Marvin<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;CÃ©dric Beust â&quot; &quot; &lt;cbeust@...&gt; <br/>\nwrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; Very fair points, Marvin.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Quick question for you:  does the existence of a tool that <br/>\n </span></blockquote>performs this<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; upgrade automatically (or for the most part) make this more <br/>\n </span></blockquote>acceptable to<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; you?
