I<br/>\nfeel part of the cost of<br/>\nmembership of any group is to listen and participate even if it is to only<br/>\nread other people&#39;s questions and thoughts.<br/>\nIf you don&#39;t feel like helping me, that is your decision and I respect that.<br/>\nWhat I would ask of you is to limit<br/>\nthe frivolous chatter in this group that seems to fill my inbox including<br/>\nyour pompous lectures that imply that you are<br/>\nsome kind of royalty so that replies that have useful content can get their<br/>\ndue attention.<br/>\n<br/>\nlee<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n12/27/01 12:54:47 PM, &quot;J.
