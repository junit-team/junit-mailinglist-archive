However, as you say, there are \nprobably scenarios in which the more explicit statement is useful.\n\nAt 08:35 AM 4/3/2002 +0200, you wrote:\n\n&gt;Don&#39;t get me wrong I&#39;m a big fan of JUnit and unit testing but...\n&gt;\n&gt;...I do regularly have problems using components, which would not have\n&gt;occurred if there had been clearly stated pre-conditions (admittedly these\n&gt;components don&#39;t usually come with associated unit tests).\n&gt;Are a collection of unit tests a clear statement of the contract? I&#39;m not\n&gt;convinced. I do agree that by rigourously using TFD you will end up with\n&gt;classes/methods with sweet smelling contracts. However if we consider the\n&gt;airline metaphor which is often used for DBC: when I&#39;m booking a ticket\n&gt;with an airline I like to know the conditions which are attached - I don&#39;t\n&gt;merely  want a list of previous passengers and how they got on.\n&gt;\n&gt;Steven Hale, wm-data\n\n\nDavid Olivier\nNaval Research Laboratory\nDigital Mapping, Charting & Geodesy Analysis Program\nCode 7440.2\n\n\n",
