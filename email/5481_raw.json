Of course I can\nput a main() in MyTestSuite with code similar to *Runner.run(new\nMyTestSuite()) and that will work! I started looking through the source code\nof the TextRunner to try to work it out but decided it wasn&#39;t important\nenough to me at the time. So that&#39;s an exaple of where documentation would\nhave helped.\n\nToby\n\nVladimir Bossicard wrote:\n\n&gt; &gt; Where is the documentation that really explains what the various test\n&gt; &gt; runners do? Where is the javadoc for these classes?\n&gt;\n&gt; What are you not understanding?  Users don&#39;t need to fully understand\n&gt; the runners to use them and IMHO that&#39;s the reason why they are not\n&gt; fully documented.\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;ll be glad to answer your questions but I need a first, more specific\n&gt; question to start.\n&gt;\n&gt; -Vladimir\n&gt;\n&gt; --\n&gt; Vladimir Bossicard\n&gt; www.bossicard.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
