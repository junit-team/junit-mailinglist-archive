Break them up if\n&gt; you like:\n&gt; \n&gt; public void testALotOfStuff() {\n&gt;     checkA();\n&gt;     checkB();\n&gt;     checkC();\n&gt; }\n&gt; \n&gt; If any of the checkX() methods fails, the others\n&gt; aren&#39;t run, but the\n&gt; test is cleaned up.\n&gt; \n&gt; -Kevin\nHi Kevin, \nI can&#39;t do this, because there are too many different\ncombinations of checkX() methods that could be tested\nin the subclass, so I will write some redundant\nmethods\nthat will not be used. Besides subclass might not want\nto execute checkX(). But the JUnit executes all \ntestXXX(). What&#39;s more my checkX() are designed as\nseparate tests and I do think &quot;setUp&quot; and &quot;tearDown&quot;\nhave to be executed between them.\n\nI still do not regard my solution as perfect.\nBut it does the job - the statistics of\nError/Failure/Number of tests works fine and I&#39;m able\nto quickly locate where an error has happened.\n\nThanks a lot to all,\n  Kaloyan\n\n\n\n\t\t\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nNew and Improved Yahoo!
