First, the naming convention tells\n&gt; &gt; you that a method is a constructor. Understanding Java should tell you\n&gt; &gt; everything you need to know about why that method is there. A\n&gt; &gt; constructor&#39;s job is to ensure that an object is usable and &quot;ready to\n&gt; &gt; rock&quot; when it&#39;s handed off. Part of an object being &quot;ready to rock&quot;,\n&gt; &gt; is that it should be fully loaded and in a guaranteed valid state.\n&gt; &gt; Telling people to do the least amount possible in a constructor is\n&gt; &gt; encouraging them to hand out objects that are (potentially) in an\n&gt; &gt; invalid internal state. That will get you a &quot;reading of the riot act&quot;\n&gt; &gt; on any project that I&#39;m leading. An object must _always_ have a valid\n&gt; &gt; internal state. As programs run in more and more multithreaded\n&gt; &gt; environments these days, this rule becomes even more important. You\n&gt; &gt; _never_ know when your object might be accessed, therefore it should\n&gt; &gt; _always_ be ready for access.\n&gt;\n&gt; You know, I almost said this myself, but I think point 5 implicitly\n&gt; addresses this. I suspect this could be made a little clearer in the\n&gt; article, but I&#39;m not really sure the author and you actually disagree here.\n\nPoint five does agree with the second half of my statement. But I\nremain resolute that a constructor&#39;s _responsibility_ is to return an\nobject that is ready to be used _and_ that has a valid internal state.\nPoint five does not address this specific aspect.\n\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Point five. I agree up to a point. There will always be some things\n&gt; &gt; that need to be done in specific sequences. Opening and closing files\n&gt; &gt; leaps to mind at this point.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; However this can conflict with your response to point 1. What if a\n&gt; constructor needs to open a file? And for that matter why do files have\n&gt; to be opened anyway? Perhaps file writes and reads should auto-open and\n&gt; close files as necessary. We used to think we had to explicitly allocate\n&gt; and free memory, but we don&#39;t do that any more. Why do we treat files\n&gt; the same way?\n\nI don&#39;t see how this conflicts with my first point, but the rest of\nyour thought is an excellent point and one that many scripting\nlanguages have been pushing with the behaviour of closures operating\nagainst files. There may be times when you want to do some funky file\nhandling logic, but most of the time, you just want to process each\nbyte/character/line and be done with it.\n\nSimon\n\n-- \nwww.simonpeter.org\n\n",
