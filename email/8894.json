What I was proposing was an optional<br/>\nability on a given testcase, and I&#39;d make the determination on a case by<br/>\ncase basis. I agree, I don&#39;t want to do this for everything all the time<br/>\n(another reason I don&#39;t like the idea of using suites for it) -- most of the<br/>\ntime random order is fine -- but occasionally I&#39;d like to do so.<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess over the years w/ thousands of tests & thousands and test runs, I&#39;ve<br/>\ndone it enough to want to consider this.
