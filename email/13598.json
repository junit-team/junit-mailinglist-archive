Muller<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; &gt; All objects should be in a &quot;sane&quot; state all the time. If  not, then the <br/>\n&gt; &gt; design could be improved to avoid this problem. The Pragmatic <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Programmers call what you describe as &quot;Programming by Coincidence&quot;.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &quot;Sane state&quot; does NOT mean that everything can be done to the <br/>\n&gt; object at every time. Cedric&#39;s &quot;initialized&quot; example is <br/>\n&gt; probably actually a design flaw, but for other states, it <br/>\n&gt; makes of course much sense to disallow certain operations: If <br/>\n&gt; a database connection is not open, you cannot execute a <br/>\n&gt; select; if a file has been deleted, it cannot be deleted a <br/>\n&gt; second time; a bill that has been cancelled cannot be <br/>\n&gt; invoiced; etc.etc.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Exactly.  Even with a sane object, not all methods can be called at any<br/>\ntime, and since your code has this restriction, it&#39;s not surprising to me<br/>\nthat the tests should reflect that.<br/>\n<br/>\nInstead of relying on a mock database, I&#39;d rather use the real one on my<br/>\ntests and if the connection fails, I want the testing framework to simply<br/>\n*not* call any of my database tests and let me know they were not run.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; In many cases I saw and see, programmers/designers/architects <br/>\n&gt; seem to believe that the String class (where you can indeed <br/>\n&gt; execute every method sensibly at every time) is the <br/>\n&gt; paradigmatic example of a class. Nothing can be further from <br/>\n&gt; the truth: Many classes have an &quot;interesting state diagram&quot;, <br/>\n&gt; where certain operations can only be invoked if certain <br/>\n&gt; conditions hold.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Interesting point.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; &gt; - A certain object can only be created if a previous object<br/>\n&gt; &gt; has been created<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; before.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; If so, then the previous object should be the only thing that can <br/>\n&gt; &gt; create the new object!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; This is often contrary to design concepts with somewhat <br/>\n&gt; centralized responsibilities.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Agreed.  Sometimes a method needs two objects to create a third one, and<br/>\nthis method doesn&#39;t belong to a class more than another.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Still, on a more general level - e.g. when one talks about <br/>\n&gt; closely tied groups of classes (yes: they are there; not even <br/>\n&gt; one of the tutorials that explain JUnit pretends that <br/>\n&gt; litterally everything makes sense to be<br/>\n&gt; mocked) - the guidelines hinted at by JBR do make sense.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yes.  It&#39;s just that when you do testing, you very rapidly leave &quot;unit<br/>\ntesting&quot; (testing of one class) to do some other form of testing, and JUnit<br/>\nstarts being a strain when this happens in my experience because of these<br/>\ndeficiencies.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nCédric<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://beust.com/weblog\">http://beust.com/weblog</a></div>",
