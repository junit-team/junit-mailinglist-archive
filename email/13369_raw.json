I&#39;ve learned alot from this thread.  And - I&#39;ve\nordered JUnit =\r\nRecipes from Amazon.\n\nHaving just started with JUnit and with the idea of w=\r\nriting tests for\nall of my code, I must say that I&#39;m delighted with the res=\r\nults.  Oh -\nI&#39;m not writing much new code.  Most of the unit tests are for =\r\ncode\nthat already exists for which I&#39;m fixing bugs.\n\nThere isn&#39;t much suppo=\r\nrt for tests on my team because we tend to be in\nfire-fighting mode all the=\r\n time. So, of course, we&#39;ll right good tests\n&quot;later&quot;.  However, the tests h=\r\nave helped me much more than I would\nhave expected with:\n\n* developing a fa=\r\nster, deeper understanding of the code I&#39;m working with\n\n* improving the de=\r\nsign of existing code (so that I can actually test something!)\n\n* giving me=\r\n the confidence to make changes and knowing that I&#39;m not\nbreaking related c=\r\node\n\n* thinking more deeply about what I&#39;m doing\n\nI really can&#39;t imagine go=\r\ning back to not writing tests.  Now the thing\nI need to do next is figure o=\r\nut how to build support for running a\nsuite of tests as part of our build p=\r\nrocess and getting our other\ndevelopers to create and run tests, too.\n\nThan=\r\nk you all again -\n\nChris\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn 4/26/05, Jason Rogers &lt;jacaetevha@fast=\r\n-mail.org&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; On Tuesday 26 April 2005 17:40, in a message called =\r\nRe: [junit] a test\n&gt; pattern ?, Adam Wildavsky wrote:\n&gt; &gt; J.
