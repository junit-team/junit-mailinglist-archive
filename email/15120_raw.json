But I have to\n=\r\nrun the tests with several JREs in order to be sure that the lib runs\nprope=\r\nrly with all jres our customers have.\ntoday, I=B4m using a batch file where=\r\n I call the Testrunner and of\ncourse I can check the exit code. But all thi=\r\ns is in a batch file, not\nin one test at all. So I set up a test where I si=\r\nmply called the\nnormal test by  \n\n\t\tProcess p =3D Runtime.getRuntime().exec=\r\n(command);\n\t\tp.waitFor();\n\t\tint code =3D p.exitValue();\n\t\tassertEquals(&quot;Tes=\r\nt failed&quot;,0,code);\n\n\nwhere as command is the full java call including the d=\r\nifferent\njre/bin/java.exe.\n\nThe problem here is, that the single test calle=\r\nd with exec() does not\nreturn.\n\nAny ideas how to run a test with several JR=\r\nEs from within another test?\n\nThanks in advance, friedhelm\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
