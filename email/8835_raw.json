[...]\n&gt;\n&gt;  So you have two main te=\r\nst suites.\n&gt;\n&gt;  1. Object-level tests.\n&gt;  2. Integration tests.\n&gt;\n&gt;  This n=\r\necessarily means that you do not have the benefit of &quot;one defect,\n&gt;one fail=\r\nure&quot;, since likely you always have &quot;one defect, at least two\n&gt;failures&quot;.\n&gt;\n=\r\n&gt;No, I have a complex hierarchy.\n\nDon&#39;t we all.\n\nYour complex hierarchy, I =\r\nimagine, boils down to a set of object-level tests (unit tests -- focus on =\r\na single object) and a set of integration tests (involve many objects, poss=\r\nibly one package at a time).\n\n&gt;  &gt;Since\n&gt;  &gt;I can&#39;t control the order of ex=\r\necution (it is likely package\n&gt;alphabetical\n&gt;  &gt;or\n&gt;  &gt;something), I can&#39;t =\r\ntell what is the lowest level test. I&#39;d like to\n&gt;reduce\n&gt;  &gt;the effort inve=\r\nsted here.\n&gt;\n&gt;  This is a myth. You *can* control the order of execution of=\r\n test and of\n&gt;test suites; you simply have to maintain suites.\n&gt;\n&gt;As  I sai=\r\nd above, I know I *probably* could do it with suites ... \n\nNot &quot;probably&quot;. =\r\nDefinitely.\n\n&gt;BUT. As I\n&gt;refactor, as code grows, the suites (being separat=\r\ne from the tests) are .\n&gt;but that seems a level of manual effort/management=\r\n that is counter\n&gt;productive -- and hence counter testing. IMHO anything th=\r\nat can be better\n&gt;done by a computer ought be done by a computer.\n\nMaintain=\r\ning test suites is not counterproductive if you have a need to maintain tes=\r\nt suites. If you need to maintain test suites to do your work, then maintai=\r\nning test suites is, by definition, productive.\n\nI don&#39;t see how a computer=\r\n can do what you&#39;re suggesting. If I understood correctly, you want to iden=\r\ntify tests that depend on one another. What I suggested was a way to do tha=\r\nt with what JUnit already provides. Obviously, you can take that scheme, fa=\r\nctor out a little engine and make it data-driven; but my point remains: it&#39;=\r\ns not an addition to JUnit you seek, but another way of building suites.\n\n&gt;=\r\nSay I have an object X that aggregates Y and Z I want X to depend upon Y\n&gt;t=\r\nests and Z tests. \n\nFor object-level tests, I agree that object X maps to a=\r\n suite of tests, possibly all implemented as a single TestCase class. That =\r\nwould be mechanical enough that you may be able to write a script to determ=\r\nine that mapping.\n\nFor integration tests, as you say you have, how do you m=\r\nap object X to the integration tests containing object X? I wonder how you&#39;=\r\nd script determining that mapping? Note that objects X, Y and Z would all m=\r\nap to the intersection of all integration tests containing X, integration t=\r\nests containing Y and integration tests containing Z. I cannot begin to ima=\r\ngine how to determine that mapping without having a human maintain it someh=\r\now.\n\n&gt;What suite would I create?\n\nI would create the suite I know I need. B=\r\nut then, I don&#39;t view integration tests by the objects they test: I view th=\r\nem by the features they support.\n\n&gt;Also, say I have A that\n&gt;aggregate B and=\r\n C -- with finally an object aggregating X and A. What if A\n&gt;started using =\r\nX? Trying to manage suites to represent this hierarchy seems\n&gt;nightmarish.\n=\r\n\nThat&#39;s why there are object-level tests and customer tests. The customer t=\r\nests generally test the system from end to end and the object-level tests g=\r\nenerally test one object at a time. Anything in between is written as neede=\r\nd and thrown away when no longer needed, in my opinion.\n\n&gt;I would like to b=\r\ne able to set X to depend upon Y/Z (almost a &quot;dynamic\n&gt;suite&quot;) and set A on=\r\n Y and Z\n\nIf *you* are setting it, then how is that different from what I s=\r\nuggest? Either a computer program determines the mapping, or you determine =\r\nthe mapping. How you EXPRESS the mapping is just a matter of implementation=\r\n details. Start by maintaining the suite by hand, notice the patterns in th=\r\ne way you do things, then script it.\n\n&gt;Is what I am discussing unreasonable=\r\n? It seems an easy interface for users,\n&gt;and something that junit could man=\r\nage behind the scenes.\n\nI just don&#39;t think it&#39;s part of JUnit. It&#39;s a new T=\r\nest Runner, perhaps. It&#39;s a specialized Test Suite Builder. But the framewo=\r\nrk already supports what you want; someone just has to do the work of build=\r\ning it.\n\n&gt;[Gosh, if the Eclipse junit wizard did this for me via class intr=\r\nospection,\n&gt;that&#39;d be a beautiful thing...]\n\nI&#39;m not sure about that myself=\r\n....\n\n&gt;  &gt;P.S. The Eclipse junit plugin that search projects to find all te=\r\nsts,\n&gt;find\n&gt;  &gt;tests in dependant project, but doesn&#39;t run them &quot;in the CWD=\r\n of that\n&gt;  &gt;project&quot; (which matters for some tests).\n&gt;\n&gt;  It shouldn&#39;t. It=\r\n is best to write your tests so that it doesn&#39;t. Or your\n&gt;production code; =\r\nwhichever. Pass the desired working directory into the\n&gt;tests as a JVM para=\r\nmeter or something.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;I might agree with you, but I am testing ant tasks=\r\n -- that process XML\n&gt;files -- and it seems wholly reasonable that they rea=\r\nd them from a file.\n\nRead from all the files you want; but don&#39;t depend on =\r\nthe CWD: pass that into the system as a parameter.\n\n&gt;Since I am subclassing=\r\n from the test utility that ant provides for this, I\n&gt;have to use the file =\r\nmechanism they provide. \n\nNo argument there.\n\n&gt;Also, since I am not launchi=\r\nng\n&gt;the junit (Eclipse is) I don&#39;t have the JVM control you state -- especi=\r\nally\n&gt;when it is choosing to run tests from multiple projects.\n\nWhat?! The =\r\nJUnit test runner *I* know allows you to configure JVM properties. Certainl=\r\ny the Ant runner does. Did I miss a meeting?\n\n\nJ. B.
