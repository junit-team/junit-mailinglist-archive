Ultimately, that&#39;s what demonstrates the presence of features to the people paying for the software. In many cases, there will be a Programmer Test or two that tests your application engine in exactly the same way that your Customer Test tests your entire application. If you find this to be the case, then consider not writing the application engine test and instead test the low-level objects. If there is nothing in between -- if your Action objects are as low-level as you get -- then live with the duplication. Ultimately, you need to test your front end through HTTP.<br/>\n<br/>\nTake care.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;So said Erik Mattsson on 4/24/2003 --------------------<br/>\n&gt;Im finding it hard to find the right amount of testing when I<br/>\n&gt;create my tests.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Example:<br/>\n&gt;I have a http server that receives http requests. These request is<br/>\n&gt;in the server split into different actions. The actions can be<br/>\n&gt;&quot;login&quot; or &quot;logoff&quot; etc.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Actions are seperate classes, which has been tested for &quot;most&quot; possible<br/>\n&gt;errors and possibilities. I have one unit testcase for each action.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Now im sitting and doing some HTTP-Unit testing of the whole http server,<br/>\n&gt;trying to login, logoff, etc. I start the server and connect to it as a<br/>\n&gt;real HTTP client, to test the functionality.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;But somehow I started to create similar tests for each action that Ive<br/>\n&gt;already tested (testing the same problems that I did on the action level),<br/>\n&gt;which means Im sitting with ALOT of testcases that looks the same but are<br/>\n&gt;invoked from different levels. (the action itself is one level, the<br/>\n&gt;server is on a higher level)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;What is the &quot;right&quot; amount of testing, is it best to do the same test but<br/>\n&gt;on different levels in order to make sure that NO strange behaviour is<br/>\n&gt;discovered or should I just test the whole flow?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;More tests = better software? ;)<br/>\n&gt;//Erik<br/>\n&gt;---------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;Erik Mattsson<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;imBridge AB<br/>\n&gt;Vasaplatsen 8<br/>\n&gt;SE-411 34 Göteborg<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Phone: +46-31-138310<br/>\n&gt;Mobile: +46-733-174116<br/>\n&gt;www.imbridge.com<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Yahoo!
