So that<br/>\n&gt; makes good sense (to me) as a single test.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Hmm.. interesting, I would tend to think of save & load as two<br/>\nseparate, but complimentary, behaviours. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; If you had some kind of requirement that things written with<br/>\n&gt; saveLicense have a particular format, or that loadLicense expects a<br/>\n&gt; particular format (for 3rd party integration or something), then <br/>\n&gt; you&#39;d have more behaviors and probably want to make separate tests.  <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>So then, where does that format come from in the problem in hand?  You<br/>\nmust certainly have a format defined.. or how could you write either<br/>\nsave or load?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Even in<br/>\n&gt; that case, though, testing that stuff saved with saveLicense can be<br/>\n&gt; loaded with loadLicense isn&#39;t a bad thing to do.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yes.  Agreed.  But try to avoid using a file to do it.<br/>\n<br/>\nDave</div>",
