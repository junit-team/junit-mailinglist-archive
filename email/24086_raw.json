If a test method is returning output, the output is captu=\r\nred in\n&gt; &gt; the same file from which input was provided.\n&gt; &gt; 4) The test met=\r\nhods in the IDE now show, for each run of a given test\n&gt; &gt; method, what was=\r\n its input parameters. So if I have a test method with name\n&gt; &gt; testMethodw=\r\nithItemIdParam that takes a single input parameter itemId, then\n&gt; &gt; when th=\r\nis test method is executed for different itemId values, the IDE will\n&gt; &gt; sh=\r\now something like this :\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; testMethodwithItemIdParam{itemId=3D1}\n&gt; &gt; =\r\ntestMethodwithItemIdParam{itemId=3D2}\n&gt; &gt; testMethodwithItemIdParam{itemId=\r\n=3D3}\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; 5) You can generate reports of your test run using a simple @=\r\nReport\n&gt; &gt; annotation\n&gt; &gt; 6) You can capture some analytics related informa=\r\ntion about your class\n&gt; &gt; under test using @Intercept annotation.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; A=\r\nnd theres a lot more features.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; If interested, check out the github =\r\nproject :\n&gt; &gt; https://github.com/EaseTech/easytest\n&gt; &gt; For information abou=\r\nt the features supported by EasyTest, look at its WIKI:\n&gt; &gt; https://github.=\r\ncom/EaseTech/easytest/wiki\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; [Non-text portions of this=\r\n message have been removed]\n&gt;\n\n\n\n",
