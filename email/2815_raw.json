B. Rainsberger&quot; &lt;jbrains762@...&gt;\r\n\r\nKent:\n\nThe design strategy you have suggested is one that I have, I suppose, \n&quot;independently discovered&quot; as a good way to make unit testing easier. (In \nother words, I didn&#39;t have an experienced person standing by me on day 1 \nsaying, &quot;Do it this way.&quot;) If class A only cares about one or two pieces of \ninformation normally managed by class B, then A does not need to depend on \nB. The application ought perhaps to give to A the parts of B it needs.\n\nThis makes me wonder whether the OP is truly trying to unit test with JUnit, \nor do integration testing. What do you say, OP?\n\nJBR.\n\n\n----- Original message -----\n &gt; You&#39;ve made this suggestion a few times recently, and I was hoping\nyou would\n &gt; elaborate on it. Do you have a specific example in mind of how a\nTestSetup\n &gt; indicated that something was wrong.\n\nWe had a singleton for the exchange rates. Every time we wrote the\ndata for a unit test we had to look up the historical figures, or\ntake out the existing rates temporarily. You know the drill.\n\nThe solution was not to make plugging special exchange rates easier,\nit was to limit visibility of exchange rates to only those objects\nthat really needed them, and passing exchange rates into them either\nas method parameters or constructor parameters. This enabled a bunch\nof other design simplifications that we wouldn&#39;t have seen if we\nhadn&#39;t forced ourselves to make test writing easier.\n\nI&#39;m wondering if the OP&#39;s problem isn&#39;t similar. Reading a properties\nfile is expensive, so we only want to do it once for a bunch of\ntests. Well, what if you explicitly passed the properties you need to\nthe methods that need them?\n\nKent\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nGet your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com/intl.asp\n\n\n",
