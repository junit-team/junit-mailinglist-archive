We have a simple alert in our Eclipse plug-in that can<br/>\nwarn you if you haven&#39;t run a test within a configured amount of time.<br/>\n  We also have a graphic representation of the last few hours of<br/>\ntesting activity. So you can see when you last ran a test, how long<br/>\nyou have been fixing a test, and an impression of your recent testing<br/>\nrhythm.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor screen shots of the test run ticker:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://community.devcreek.com/space/David+Jones/blog/2007-03-26_1\">https://community.devcreek.com/space/David+Jones/blog/2007-03-26_1</a><br/>\n<br/>\nAnd you can see the website view based on actual testing:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://devcreek.com/principalActivity/TestCreek/DGJ\">https://devcreek.com/principalActivity/TestCreek/DGJ</a><br/>\n<br/>\nThe alerts in combination with the graphics activity summary do seem<br/>\nto be useful for both guiding the adoption of a TDD style, and also<br/>\nfor highlighting to the more experienced tester when they have drifted<br/>\nfrom their preferred style such as when one gets lost in the debugger<br/>\nfor hours rather than writing a new test.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne feature that we have talked about about implementing in the past,<br/>\nwould be to publish these graphics traces of testing activity rhythms<br/>\nfor beginners to use then as exemplars to work towards. Perhaps even<br/>\nsome silly scoring mechanism to rate how close you measure to your<br/>\nfavourite star tester.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother direction could be for the expert experimenting with altering<br/>\ntheir testing and development practices to collect a series of<br/>\nrecorded traces as one record and measure of their exploration as they<br/>\nweigh up the pros/cons of the variations they have tried.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers<br/>\nDavid Jones</div>",
