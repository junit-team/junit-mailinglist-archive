I meant in your \n&gt;failing test, before and after the invocation of the Class Under Test. \n&gt;However, use whatever works - and the assert approach may not work at all.\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nGood, because that won&#39;t work.  The production code gets used in many \npaths, and I decided the asserts in it would be to &quot;generic&quot; to help.\n\n&gt;Also, I&#39;ll mention another idea, although it may be anathema to this \n&gt;list.  If you can somehow DETECT the failure, put a breakpoint in your \n&gt;application (System.in or something to that effect), and then fire up \n&gt;your debugger and inspect the state of everything.\n&gt;\n&gt;I know that many people on this list (and Dave Astel&#39;s in his fine book) \n&gt;say you shouldn&#39;t need the debugger if you TDD intensively enough.  I \n&gt;myself am unfortunately not to that level yet, and I often find it \n&gt;useful to fire up the debugger.\n&gt;\n&gt;Whatever approach you use, I think the general idea is to gradually \n&gt;narrow down the scope of the unknown failure until you can see what is \n&gt;the root cause.\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nThat&#39;s certainly the cause.  The problem is that I only see it once a \nday or so, so narrowing it down may take a while.  I was hoping \n(originally) that runing it &quot;a lot&quot;, under &quot;random conditions&quot; might \nmake it show itself more than once a day.\n\n\n&gt;Hope this helps,\n&gt;Chad\n&gt;\n&gt;David Corbin wrote:\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;Prefectly reasonable suggestion.  I&#39;ll give it a try. For some reason, I \n&gt;&gt;don&#39;t think of asserts outside my tests.  (I&#39;m don&#39;t like the clutter).\n&gt;&gt;Chad Woolley wrote:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Probably not the advice you want, but have you tried to use asserts to \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;get more info?  Whatever the failure is, keep adding asserts about \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;anything you can think of regarding the expected state of the app and \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;objects under test.  Even (especially?) add ones for things you may \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;think are obviously working correctly.  This may give you some clues to \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;the problem.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;David Corbin wrote:\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;        \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I&#39;ve got one tests which fails sporadically, and I cannot figure out any \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;reason for it to be non-deterministic in MY code.  I&#39;ve added some \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;logging statements, but It&#39;s hard to get to fail.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;            \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt;junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; \n&gt;\n&gt;Yahoo!
