I\nactually agree with using &#39;throws Exception&#39; .  Recently I was burned on a\ncheckstyle &quot;code review&quot; of my testing package that tagged me on *every*\ninstance of &#39;throws Exception&#39; (too general) *and* tagged me that I didn&#39;t\ndocument them (no @throws).  I *knew* I was using the commonly-accepted\nidiom, but my confidence was shot down.   I guess I wanted to hear what\npeople thought about it, and explore the alternatives, and to reassure\nmyself that I was really doing the right thing all along by just throwing\nException (and not necessarily documenting it.)\n \nThanks & apologies if anyone felt I was stringing the group along.\n--DP\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: J. B. Rainsberger [mailto:jbrains@...] \nSent: Thursday, July 15, 2004 4:10 PM\nTo: junit@yahoogroups.com\nSubject: Re: [junit] Documenting test cases\n\n\nDavid Plass wrote:\n\n&gt; Well, that wouldn&#39;t compile then.\n&gt; \n&gt; In my example, I wanted to test the behavior that method.throwsNPE only\n&gt; throws NPE under certain circumstances (e.g., null argument.)\n&gt; In other words, I wanted to test the throwsNPE&#39;s &quot;contract&quot; (flames to\n&gt; /dev/null)  that it throws NPE when it says it will.\n&gt; \n&gt; If method.throwsNPE could also throw IOException, but my test case wanted\nto\n&gt; verify that it should NOT throw IOException in this circumstance, then I&#39;d\n&gt; change the test method to the following:\n&gt; \n&gt;      public void testExceptions() {    // note no throws\n&gt;          try {\n&gt;              method.throwsNPE();\n&gt;              fail(&quot;Should have thrown NPE&quot;);\n&gt;          } catch (NullPointerException expected) {\n&gt;              assertTrue(&quot;Should catch NPE&quot;, true);\n&gt;          } catch (IOException notExpected) {\n&gt;              fail(&quot;Unexpected IOException&quot;);\n&gt;          }\n&gt;      }\n&gt; \n&gt; Then your next question might be, &quot;what if it can throw a third\nexception&quot;?\n&gt; After a while (maybe after just one more exception) I&#39;d probably just cave\n&gt; and write &quot;throws Exception&quot;.\n\nRight.\n\nThe community has had long, long discussions about this \nexception-testing pattern, and the consensus seems to be this: catching \nan unexpected exception and failing buys no value over letting JUnit \ncatch the exception; therefore, simply throw those exceptions up to \nJUnit. The corollary seems to be, just have every test throw Exception.\n\nOf course, if you find value in the above, then I&#39;m not going to tell \nyou to stop. I&#39;m just pointing out what we&#39;ve been saying for a few \nyears in case that information should be useful.\n\nThanks.\n-- \nJ. B.
