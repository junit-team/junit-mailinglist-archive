If not, then the \ndesign could be improved to avoid this problem. The Pragmatic \nProgrammers call what you describe as &quot;Programming by Coincidence&quot;.\n\n&gt; I am a firm believer that tests should be as close as possible to production\n&gt; code.  I don&#39;t know about you, but:\n&gt; \n&gt; - I am nervous when I run my tests on Postgresql and the production site\n&gt; runs on Oracle.\n&lt;snip /&gt;\n\nI am obviously not clear enough in my approach. Let me try to rectify \nthat here.\n\nAs a programmer I do not want rely on Collaboration tests to prove the \ncorrectness of /individual objects/. Instead I want to rely on Isolation \ntests (with fakes/mocks and interface separation) for that.\n\nI only want to use Collaboration tests when I&#39;m worried that I might get \nthe collaboration among objects wrong, such as what you describe: \nPostgresql v. Oracle. I could write a body of tests that can do double \nduty, but I would probably run the tests against HSQLDB more often than \nI run them against Oracle.\n\nI know that /someone/ will want to use Collaboration tests extensively \n-- testers, customers, whoever -- and I don&#39;t begrudge them that, just \nas long as they don&#39;t expect me to maintain their tests.\n\n&gt; - I feel ever worse when my tests are using mocks, because not only are\n&gt; mocks non trivial to write (and they require you to maintain a parallel line\n&gt; of code), they can give you a deadly sense of security.  And then one day,\n&gt; your mock tests run fine but the production code breaks, and you enter a\n&gt; world of pain.  Trust me, it&#39;s not pretty.\n\nSince I don&#39;t have this pain often enough to be serious, I must be doing \nsomething else -- some kind of compensating practice -- to avoid it. I \nwish I knew what that was so I could share it with everyone.\n\n&gt; With all that in mind, it makes sense to have a testing framework that takes\n&gt; dependencies into account and makes it as easy as possible for you to:\n&gt; \n&gt; - Identify which test *really* broke (compare &quot;1 SUCESS 25 FAILED&quot; to &quot;1\n&gt; SUCCESS 1 FAILED and 23 SKIPS&quot;).\n&gt; - Allow you to rerun the failed tests easily, including all the dependencies\n&gt; if any\n&gt; \n&gt; These are the main features that TestNG offers (and many more of course\n&gt; :-)).\n\nI agree that for those people who prefer to stay close to real \ndependencies, TestNG&#39;s features are great. I find my designs are cleaner \nwhen I try to move away from hardcoded/real dependencies towards an \ninterface-rich design.\n\nThat&#39;s what makes the world great: we can get to the same place \ndifferent ways and not want to kill each other. I wish certain countries \nwould feel the same way. :)\n\nTake care.\n-- \nJ. B.
