I feel part of the cost of \nmembership of any group is to listen and participate even if it is to only read other people&#39;s questions and thoughts.\nIf you don&#39;t feel like helping me, that is your decision and I respect that.  What I would ask of you is to limit\nthe frivolous chatter in this group that seems to fill my inbox including your pompous lectures that imply that you are \nsome kind of royalty so that replies that have useful content can get their due attention.\n\nlee\n\n\n\n12/27/01 12:54:47 PM, &quot;J.

I got one\n&gt;   reply.\n&gt;   &gt;\n&gt;   &gt; In the meantime, what else got a response?  Well, we seem to have time\n&gt;   &gt; to respond to trivial subjects and partake\n&gt;   &gt; in what is nothing short of mental masturbation and ignore substantive\n&gt;   &gt; questions that require some effort.\n&gt;   &gt; I think I have read about 30 messages about getters and setters that\n&gt;   &gt; sounds more like a pissing contest.  And then there is the chatter\n&gt;   &gt; about one piece of spam.  How many worthless messages did this &quot;spam&quot;\n&gt;   &gt; generate?  Boy we nailed that one didn&#39;t we?\n&gt;   &gt;\n&gt;   &gt; If you need someone to chat with, get a dog.  I got one, he just\n&gt;   &gt; doesn&#39;t know java/junit...yet.\n&gt;   &gt;\n&gt;   &gt; Sorry for the vent but I grow tired of groping in the dark.\n&gt;   &gt;\n&gt;   &gt; Thanks for your help.\n&gt;   &gt;\n&gt;   &gt; Lee Chalupa\n&gt;\n&gt;   =======================================\n&gt;   J.
