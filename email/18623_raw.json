By doing this you have\nconfidence in your code.\n\nThat said it&#39;s nice when your tests verify your code\ncontinuosly.\n\nSo with what I did above it&#39;s possible that I tested\nmy &quot;Challenge&quot; using JUnit,\n\nthen copied and pasted the code into a method, and\nthis method also contained other code.\n\nNow I broke my ability to continously test that\n&quot;section&quot; of code as the .java file is updated...It&#39;s\npossible that someone applies a patch that overwrites\nit...the test still passes, but the actual code is\nbroken...\n\nBut that&#39;s an easy thing to fix...just mentioned it\nbecause it&#39;s important...\n\nCheers,\n- Ole\n\n\n\n--- Mike Bria &lt;bria526xp@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt; OIe --\n&gt; \n&gt; Just curious if you had any comment on my question\n&gt; to you earlier in the\n&gt; chain.
