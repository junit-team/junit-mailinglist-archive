I cherish the discussion on this list\n&gt; about meaty topics of unit testing and using and extending JUnit.  There\n&gt; are some very smart people here!\n&gt; \n&gt; However, I frankly have reached the limit of my tolerance for stupid\n&gt; questions in this list.  And by &quot;stupid questions&quot; I mean the opposite\n&gt; of Eric Raymond&#39;s &quot;smart questions&quot;\n&gt; (http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html).  There seems to be\n&gt; no end to the steady stream of new members who sign on and immediately\n&gt; ask a question that&#39;s already answered in the JUnit FAQ, which every new\n&gt; member automatically receives.  I know hitting the delete key 5 or 10\n&gt; times a day isn&#39;t a huge deal, so I guess it&#39;s just the principle of it\n&gt; all.  I consider it rude for people to not have the courtesy to at least\n&gt; make an effort to help themselves.\n&gt; \n&gt; But I thought that rather than just unsubscribing from the list, I&#39;d\n&gt; toss this message out to see if anyone else is in the same boat as me.\n&gt; There are supposedly over 6000 subscribers, which sure sounds like a big\n&gt; enough population to allow some specialization.  Alternatively, if\n&gt; dividing the junit@yahoogroups.com list isn&#39;t likely to happen, does\n&gt; anyone know of a similar forum for &quot;intermediate-to-advanced&quot; users of\n&gt; JUnit with a better S/N ratio?\n\nTodd, I appreciate your concern and have raised that myself, in the \npast. I would find it difficult to stay on this list myself, if it \nweren&#39;t so low traffic. Also take into consideration the number of posts \nwe already reject, because the questions are too basic. If we don&#39;t \nencourage the general public to post their questions, then who will we \nhave to discuss interesting topics with in a few years?\n-- \nJ. B.
