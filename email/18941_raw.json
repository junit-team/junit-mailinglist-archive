When I make design decisions, I\n&gt; notate them as part of my tests. Since in my style of development I iterate\n&gt; between design, implement, and test several times a minute, I don&#39;t think\n&gt; I&#39;d like separate tools. I use the feedback from the results of each\n&gt; activity to improve my decisions in the other activities.\n&gt; \n&gt; What I can see clearly is the need to be able to view and manipulate the\n&gt; specification/design/tests in different ways to suit different purposes. For\n&gt; example, you can translate a test or set of tests into a sequence diagram.\n&gt; Sometimes I would like to see a summary of the design implications of my\n&gt; tests in this or some other graphical format.\n\nPerhaps I don&#39;t want separate tools, but a way to separate the tests \ninto two categories: essential and coverage. The essential tests are the \nones that drove my design decisions, while the coverage tests are the \nones that I added to protect against future refactorings. I think I see \nthis more as a teaching technique than a practice technique, so I&#39;ll try \nthinking of it that way for a while, rather than assuming I&#39;d want this \nin my &quot;professional practice&quot;.\n\nAs an aside, I don&#39;t remember the mood I was one when I wrote my \noriginal reply, and I don&#39;t really feel that way now, so I&#39;m left a \nlittle confused. Perhaps it was a case of wanting to look smart by \nsaying something profound-sounding. (Kent, you really bring out the \naccountability instinct in me. I imagine that will trip me up eventually \nsomehow.)\n\nTake care.\n-- \nJ. B.
