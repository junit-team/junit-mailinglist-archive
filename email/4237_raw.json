I&#39;ve used both techniques successfully.\n\nBy default, I try to keep the assertion methods local to the tests using the\nassertions.  If I have a test case testing a Money object, for example, then I&#39;ll put\nthe money-related assertions in that test case.\n\nIf I have several test cases all focused on making assertions on Money objects, then\nI&#39;ll pull the method up into a common money-related test case.\n\nIf there are test cases that aren&#39;t specifically money related, but they need to make\nassertions on Money objects for some reason, then I&#39;ll extract the money-related\nassertions into a MoneyAssertion utility class.  This rarely happens, but when I does\nit makes me think through whether it&#39;s a good thing to have money-related tests\nsprinkled far and wide.\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt; At first glance it seems that making a new specialized TestCase (i.e.-\n&gt; inheritance) to contain the custom assertion methods would be the quickest way\n&gt; to add these on. Just push them up into a new base class.\n&gt;\n\nYes!\n\n&gt;\n&gt; However, the specialized Assert class (i.e.-delegation) appears to be more\n&gt; flexible and easier to change in the future. It also seems to better communicate\n&gt; the purpose of the new class.\n&gt;\n\nYes!\n\n&gt;\n&gt; In other words, if I went with the new TestCase extension route, I&#39;m not sure\n&gt; whether I&#39;ll remember 6 months down the road that I created the new TestCase\n&gt; class to hold the custom assertions. Where as making calls to an specialized\n&gt; Assert class route would likely to be more understandable.\n&gt;\n\nPerhaps, if you remembered that the specialized Assert class existed.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; What are your thoughts on the matter of simplicity and readability vs. ease of\n&gt; initial implementation with regards to these choices? I&#39;m trying to stick to the\n&gt; Extreme Programming way of doing things.\n&gt;\n\nDo what&#39;s simplest for you today, then refactor it later if you change your mind.\nTest code can begin to smell just as production code sometimes does.  Refactoring is\nthe cure.\n\nMike\n\n--\nMike Clark\nClarkware Consulting, Inc.\nhttp://www.clarkware.com\n720.851.2014\n\n\n\n",
