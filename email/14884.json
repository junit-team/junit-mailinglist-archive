But it is misleading.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIf a class is not found, the class loader will throw a <br/>\nClassNotFoundException. If something goes wrong during static <br/>\ninitialization, the VM throws an ExceptionInInitializerException. <br/>\nSubsequent attempts to reference the class result in <br/>\nNoClassDefFoundError. For some reason, the Error rarely has an error <br/>\nmessage that makes any sense.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe see it all the time in code like this :<br/>\n<br/>\nstatic {<br/>\n   FileReader reader = new FileReader(&quot;my.properties&quot;);<br/>\n   ......<br/>\n}<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is very confusing to get a NoClassDefFoundError when the class is <br/>\ncleary right there. It is also insidious because tool vendors and <br/>\nframework providers have to load and run third party code (colloquially, <br/>\n/user code/) and have to bullet proof their own code a little more than <br/>\nusual. It&#39;s bad practice to catch Throwable, but if you don&#39;t it&#39;s <br/>\nlikely that Errors will leak out. We end up catching throwable and <br/>\nrethrowing certain Errors.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI agree with you that Errors should represent unrecoverable system <br/>\nerrors. NoClassDefFoundError is not one of those. Neither is <br/>\nOutOfMemoryError nor StackOverflowError.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the OP&#39;s case, I would wager that a class really was not found and <br/>\nthat the ClassNotFoundException caused a static initializer to fail <br/>\nwhich caused a ClassDefNotFoundError.<br/>\n<br/>\nKevin</div>",
