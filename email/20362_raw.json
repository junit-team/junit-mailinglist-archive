It was in=\r\ndicated as F (failures) and E (exception).\nWhy this was removed from JUnit =\r\n4?\n\nMoreover, if asserts of JDK 1.4 was used (assert obj!=3Dnull;) both in\n=\r\nthe tested code and in the tests than, if assertion is enabled,\nAssertionEr=\r\nror was thrown that caused to exception. In JUnit 4 it will\ncause to failur=\r\ne because AssertionFailedError now extends\nAssertionError so from JUnit poi=\r\nnt of view there is no difference.\nIt is true, that in JUnit 4 there is no =\r\ndifference between failures\nand exception, so it shouldn&#39;t be a problem. Bu=\r\nt, as I see it is.\nConsider for example following example.\n\npublic class Ca=\r\nlculator {\n ...\n public double sqrt(double a){\n   //here should be check th=\r\nat a&gt;=3D0 that is missing\n   return doSqrt(a);\n }\n\n private double doSqrt(d=\r\nouble a){\n   //a should be valid at this point\n   assert &quot;a should be not n=\r\negative!&quot; : a&gt;=3D0;\n   ...\n  }\n}\n\npublic class CalculatorTest {\n // the log=\r\nger\n private static final Log log =3D LogFactory.getLog(CalculatorTest.clas=\r\ns);\n private Calculator calc;\n\n\n @BeforeClass\n public static void oneTimeSe=\r\ntup(){\n\t// do your one time set-up here!\n\tlog.debug(&quot;Going to check whether=\r\n asserts are enabled&quot;);\n\tboolean assertsEnabled =3D false;\n\tassert (asserts=\r\nEnabled =3D true); // Intentional side effect!!!\n\tif (!assertsEnabled) {\n\t =\r\n throw new AssertionError(&quot;Asserts must be enabled!!!&quot;);\n\t}\n  }\n\n @Before\n =\r\npublic void setUp() throws Exception {\n   calc =3D new Calculator(...);\n }\n=\r\n\n public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {\n   Request r =\r\n=3D Request.aClass(clazz);\n   JUnitCore runner =3D new JUnitCore();\n   RunL=\r\nistener listener=3D new TextListener();\n   runner.addListener(listener);\n  =\r\n runner.run(r);\n }\n\n @Test\n public void testNegativeInput() {\n   try {\n    =\r\n calc.sqrt(-1);\n     fail(&quot;AssertionError expected&quot;);\n   catch(AssertionErr=\r\nor e){\n     assert true: &quot;it&#39;s ok&quot;;\n   }\n }\n}\n\nassert are used inside the c=\r\node in order to validate what programmer\nis think is true in some point of =\r\nthe program. They are often used to\ncheck preconditions of the private meth=\r\nods. In the above example,\nprogrammer that writed doSqrt() method states th=\r\nat precondition of\nthis method is that he receives valid parameter. So, thi=\r\ns JDK 1.4\nassertion fails has nothing with JUnit 4 assertXXX() fails and it=\r\n\nshould be considered as exception, as in case that unexpected\nexception is=\r\n thrown.\n\n\n\n",
