This was more about demonstrating a technique than\n&gt;  &gt; anything else.\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; Does that make a difference?\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; I don&#39;t think it does. Do you?\n&gt; \n&gt; I think it does, but I&#39;m still figuring it out.  Cleverness in design\n&gt; often comes from metaphor: what if we could think of A as a kind of B? \n&lt;snip /&gt;\n&gt; However, these metaphors are not without costs.\n&lt;snip /&gt;\n&gt; Pluggable Selector, using reflection, is such a metaphor.  So, whether\n&gt; the cost of this metaphor is worth it depends on the benefit each user\n&gt; gets, and how many uses that cost is to be amortized across.\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m still figuring this out, and I&#39;m interested in your ideas.  Thanks,\n\nAlthough I can relate to all the things you wrote, I&#39;m stuck with one \nlogical quandary.\n\nIf Pluggable Selector is OK for JUnit, then why isn&#39;t it OK for the code \nI was writing, which happened to choose rule methods the same way JUnit \nchooses test methods?\n\nYou wonder whether it matters how heavily reused the code is. So, if \nthis is code only my team will use, then it&#39;s not OK; but if it&#39;s code I \nplan to put into a general-purpose, widely-used rule engine[1], then \nit&#39;s OK. I don&#39;t buy that at all. Ignoring the effort to write the code \nthis way, its value might increase the more it&#39;s used, but that doesn&#39;t \nmean it has negative value when it&#39;s not widely used. It would seem that \nthe more people who try to use a clever design, the more that clever \ndesign costs, if you include the cost of supporting the people trying to \nuse it. As a result, I&#39;d argue the opposite: the fewer people who use \nit, the more we can afford to be clever.\n\nIn my case, JUnit /was/ the metaphor: rule methods are collected \nautomatically like test methods, and if any rule fails, the whole \nruleset fails. To anyone with any JUnit experience, I think that works \nwell. This is why I was surprised to see many JUnit users balk at it. So \nthere must be something else to it, and frankly, I can&#39;t see what it is \nbeyond those people deciding arbitrarily. That&#39;s fine, but I don&#39;t want \npeople to dress it up as more than that when that&#39;s what it is.\n-- \nJ. B.
