Are there other solutions?  What types of companies would\nbenefit from either of these?  What are the risks or downsides of\nusing these systems?  Do you recommend either TDD or AUT and why?\n\n  I could really use some intelligent feedback on this topic. \nAppreciate any help you can provide.  Thanks.\n\n\n\n",
