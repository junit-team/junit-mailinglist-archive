I not too recently had to work with some legacy code. It was rather buggy and haphazardly tested, I was in a potential minefield, &quot;change something here and break something there&quot; ...kind of situation. <br/>\n<br/>\n    Since our QA dept was having a field day with issues ;-), I had no go but to bite the bullet and make changes. I also wrote JUnit tests around what ever functionality I added or modified. Of course I did break some code here and there, what I would do was build tests around those  and then fix them. It was initially a bit hectic not to mention messy at first. I don&#39;t want to sound like a commercial but what I have now are quite a bunch of tests in place that really help in detecting in most &#39;ripple effect&#39; bugs, and yes as a programmer it has really raised my confidence level in the robustness of the code. <br/>\n<br/>\nNext on my agenda is trying to structure the tests into a more organized manner and see if I can build tests around the non-tested portions -(ok my pipe dreams...but I hope to realize this soon).<br/>\n<br/>\nMy personal view from experience it&#39;s never too late to write those tests ;-), you&#39;ll really be glad you did. So while writing tests before coding is highly desirable, it doesn&#39;tmean you&#39;re locked out from writing tests for existing code.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers !!<br/>\n<br/>\nGeorge<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: Morten Grum, PH-Consult <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Wednesday, February 26, 2003 7:58 PM<br/>\n  Subject: RE: [junit] Need help!!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  The Unit test approach is &quot;write the test before the code&quot;.
