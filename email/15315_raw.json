First off I eyeball the code both in\n&gt; the private method and the public method being tested. Most of the time\n&gt; the reason for the failure is obvious. If it&#39;s not, I&#39;ll generally set a\n&gt; breakpoint or two and step through the code in the debugger and watch\n&gt; what actually happens. This is a lot more productive than guessing at\n&gt; what the problem might be. If I could guess right, then I wouldn&#39;t need\n&gt; to step through it.\n\nIf you&#39;re going to use the debugger, then you don&#39;t need to write that \nsmaller test. Agreed. I simply prefer not to use the debugger if I don&#39;t \nhave to. It&#39;s part of me continuing to practise writing good tests.\n\n&lt;snip /&gt;\n\n&gt; If the bug proves to be deep inside another piece of code, then I might\n&gt; later add a second test that aims more closely at the bug. However,\n&gt; that&#39;s only done after I&#39;ve identified the bug, and often I don&#39;t even\n&gt; bother to do that. After all, there&#39;s already at least one test for the\n&gt; issue.\n\nThat&#39;s fine. I simply aim for smaller tests, and whenever a test fails \nand I can&#39;t pinpoint the problem, I generally aim to introduce a smaller \ntest. If not, then I&#39;d tend towards too many big tests, combinatoric \nexplosion and all that.\n\nEven if I do have to step through code with a debugger, I generally want \nto use that as a way to find out what input combination I didn&#39;t test in \none of my methods, so I can add that test.\n\nThanks for giving me a look inside your personal process. It helps me \nunderstand your point of view, even though I still disagree with &quot;it \ndoesn&#39;t solve the problem,&quot; since I obviously /do/ solve problems that way.\n\nTake care.\n-- \nJ.
