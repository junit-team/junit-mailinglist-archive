I&#39;m using RedHat 9.0, JUnit 3.8.1 and JDK 1.4.1_01.\n&gt; \n&gt; Everything works fine.  junit.samples.AllTests as well as\n&gt; \n&gt; junit.tests.AllTests... in textui, swingui, and Eclipse plugin.\n&gt; \n&gt; I do notice that in your cmd line examples you don&#39;t specify a\n&gt; classpath.  I built sat in the junit bin directory (i.e. where the\n&gt; class file tree is rooted and used cmd lines such as:\n&gt; \n&gt;  java -classpath . junit.textui.TestRunner junit.tests.AllTests\n&gt;\n&gt; I never used RedHat 8.0, I leapfrogged from 7.2 to 9.0\n&gt; \n&gt; Dave\n\nThanks for the response.  I am downloading Redhat 9 ISOs and \nI hope that they will solve the problem.  There are also additional \nnoteworthy points:\n\n1) I really think classpath settings don&#39;t help.  My classpath \nalready includes the directory with the junit.jar file, and name \nthe junit.jar file.\n\nJust to test this, I took the trouble of using various classpath \nextensions,  starting with -classpath . and going from there, \nin the root directory and below it also.  I found that most \nadditional classpaths produced additional &quot;Class not found&quot; errors.\n\nThere was one exception.  The swingui would run successfully\nif I specified -classpath \n\n    $CLASSPATH:./junit.jar\n\nbut that was just repeating a segment of the normal classpath.\n\n2) Note that the textui will run in the jdb.  under which \ncircumstance it shows a great many dots and a single F for the\nAllTests test (it does this both for the samples.AllTests and\nthe tests.AllTests).  It also runs the money.MoneyTest with\n22 dots and no F&#39;s, comparable to the swingui output.\n\n3) I had neglected to mention that additional lines of debug\noutput cited by the swingui.  They mention sun.reflect code,\nspecifically:\n\n    sun.reflect.nativeMethodAccessorImpl.invoke()\nand\n    sun.reflect.DelegatingMethodccessorImpl.invoke()\n\n4) I don&#39;t know how justified I am in considering this to be a\nserious bug.  I am inclined to raise it on the developers&#39; \nmail list, if the present forum considers it to be a genuine\nbug rather than a minor misconfiguration issue.\n\n\n\n",
