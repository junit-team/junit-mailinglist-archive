I also understand the JUnit guys&#39; reluctance to implement it. My intermediate-ish experience with TestNG leaves me with the conclusion that inter-test dependencies lead to madness. To be fair, I had already concluded that before working with clients who insisted on specifying inter-test dependencies.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I agree, which is why Assumes is a &quot;should&quot; and not a &quot;must&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; My first half-baked thought is to use a Rule to prevent running methods that depend on another method that has already failed. But that would work only if the tests were run in the appropriate order.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; So my next half-baked thought is to write a custom Runner that builds the dependency graph and sequences the tests accordingly. Then either the runner or a rule could decide whether to run a test. I&#39;m confident that a runner could do what you want, but that requires delving into the arcane bits of JUnit.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Already implemented: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://github.com/junit-team/junit.contrib/pull/5\">https://github.com/junit-team/junit.contrib/pull/5</a><br/>\n<br/>\nSome notes about the above, the sorting is not perfect, perfect<br/>\nsorting would require a full bubble sort (i.e. resort until no changes<br/>\nare made) the sorting just makes a &quot;best effort&quot; to get tests that<br/>\nAssume after the tests the assume. If you assume a test that makes<br/>\nother assumptions, there are cases where the assuming test might run<br/>\nfirst... I see nothing wrong with that other than I currently don&#39;t<br/>\nsee a mechanism to catch the failure and mark it as less critical if<br/>\nthe later run assumed test also fails.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; A final half-baked thought: What if you ran all the tests, then used the dependency graph only to mark the results somehow, so as to highlight the tests on which others depend. If you see a swarm of failures, and the display indicates that some common prerequisite test also failed, that would aid your investigation.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I see merit in that too, like I said, Assumes is a weaker contract than Depends<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; I&#39;ve seen situations where some prerequisite test fails, but some of the dependent tests pass. Sometimes the prerequisite test is lying to me (and I need to fix that). Sometimes the dependency is over-specified--the dependent test doesn&#39;t depend on everything that the prerequisite test tests (which means I need to refactor the prerequisite test and the dependency specifications). Sometimes it means that the prerequisite test fails intermittently (which means I need to track down the uncontrolled factors that affect the test).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Skipping the dependent tests hides that information. Running them and marking them would highlight that<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Dale<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --<br/>\n&gt; Dale Emery<br/>\n&gt; Consultant to software teams and leaders<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://dhemery.com\">http://dhemery.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Yahoo!
