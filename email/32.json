Sounds<br/>\n&gt; &gt; weird...<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ciao, Ilja<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Why?  I&#39;m not an EJB guy, but it seems like responsibility of an EJB<br/>\n&gt; thing is to present network accessible interface.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>But an interface to *what*?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Since good OO design<br/>\n&gt; avoids many responsibilities in a given class, this makes<br/>\n&gt; complete sense<br/>\n&gt; to me.  Plus it makes things much more flexible and easier to test.<br/>\n&gt; Just like I wouldn&#39;t have my GUI classes implement business logic.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>EJB is a distributed component modell. Why distributed? Mainly for<br/>\nreliability and scalability: As you don&#39;t care where a component<br/>\nactually resides, you can put work-intensive components on there own<br/>\ncluster, and one cluster can stand in for another one if it fails for<br/>\nsome reason.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are two main types of EJBs: entity beans and session beans. Entity<br/>\nbeans are data classes, they are responsible for persistence. Session<br/>\nbeans are the &#39;working horses&#39;, in a typical J2EE application, here<br/>\nresides your business logic.<br/>\n<br/>\nciao, Ilja</div>",
