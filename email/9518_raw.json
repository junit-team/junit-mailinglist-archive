It looks kind of like this:\n&gt; \n&gt; public void doSomething()\n&gt; {\n&gt;     Thread requestThread = new Thread()\n&gt;     {\n&gt;         public void run()\n&gt;         {\n&gt;             fireStartEvent();\n&gt; \n&gt;             //do some stuff that takes a long time\n&gt; \n&gt;             fireDoneEvent();\n&gt;         }\n&gt;     };\n&gt;     requestThread.start();\n&gt; }\n\nIs there some reason you can&#39;t test the run() method separately from\nthe threading?  I don&#39;t see anything in the snippets provided that\nwould prevent this. Is OperationAdapter dependent on having events\nfired from an active thread?  \n\nYou&#39;d have to extract a named class to hold the run method.  Then your\ntest would look something like:\n\npublic void testRun()\n{\n    m_eventCount = 0;\n    final MockService service = new MockService();\n    DoSomthingRunner runner(service);\n    service.addOperationListener(new OperationAdapter()\n    {\n        public void operationUpdate(OperationEvent event)\n        {\n            m_eventCount += 1;\n        }\n    });\n        \n    runner.run();\n            \n    assertEquals(2, m_eventCount);\n}\n\nQuestions: \nDo you trust Thread?\nIf run() is tested separately, can you trust service.doSomething() to\nstart the thread?\n\nYou could give the service a RunnerFactory (and a MockRunnerFactory\nfor testing) if you feel it is worth the effort.\n\n\n\n\n",
