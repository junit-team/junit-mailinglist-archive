There are<br/>\n&gt; two axioms that you have to use in order to make the approach<br/>\n&gt; successful:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; * NEVER assume anything about the internals.  Any code that uses<br/>\n&gt;   assumptions _*will*_ break.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Knowing about the internals does not necessarily break the tests. Daniel<br/>\nmade the point for me in his follow up post.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; * USE sufficiently strong external contracts to ensure the proper<br/>\n&gt;   usage of a type of object.  The contracts should be loose enough<br/>\n&gt;   to encourage different implementation details, but strong enough<br/>\n&gt;   to be quantifiably tested.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Sometimes the (public) contract cannot be made sufficiently strong<br/>\nbeforehand. Especially when the objects and interfaces are in the midst of<br/>\nevolving.<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, maybe the difference of our views lies in the fact that I personally<br/>\ndo as much test-driven, i.e. test-first development as possible where the<br/>\ndesign and thus the contracts come slowly into being (and often disappear<br/>\nquickly). Martin Fowler calls that evolutionary design and I guess that I<br/>\noften don&#39;t take the time to get the contracts straight and tight enough.<br/>\n<br/>\nSince your examples are taken from Excalibur I suppose that you, Berin, are<br/>\nfollowing a component-oriented and more &quot;design-up-front&quot; development<br/>\nstrategy. It could be that this difference results in different testing<br/>\nstrategies as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nJohannes</div>",
