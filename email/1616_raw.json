Changing too much jeopardizes stableness.\n\nThe major complains users have do not target the framework but the swing\nor text interface.  Adding functionalities like &quot;managing the non-loaded\nclasses&quot; via properties do not add (too much) complexity to the\nframework.\n\n&gt; - When adding too much non-core functionality one quickly looses focus of\n&gt; the core parts. Very often the extra functionality is not exactly what I\n&gt; need in a specific situation, so I have to reimplement it anyway.\n\nShare your work!  If you write things you thing is really interesting,\nshare it!  Don&#39;t expect 2-3 people to have the solution for every\nproblem you encounter :-)\n\n&gt; That&#39;s why I&#39;d rather have JUnit as a core with hooks to plug in \n&gt; additional behaviour which is available in additional tools.\n\nI partially agree.  If you have too many additional tools to run a\nprogram, you will have conflicts with versions.  I think that JUnit must\nhave a framework, a swing interface and a text interface.\n\nI proposed the architecture of &quot;plug-in&quot; modules that will enable other\nprogrammers to write specific &quot;TestResult&quot; modules (using XML,\ndatabases, mail to store the results).  This won&#39;t add complexity to\nJUnit and allow a great flexibility.\n\nI&#39;m working on to implement it for the 4.0 version.\n\n-Vladimir\n\n",
