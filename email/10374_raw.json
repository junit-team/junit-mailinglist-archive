I like this even better.\n&gt; \n&gt; Sorry if I led us down a rathole off the main JUnit subject, but I\n&gt; thought perhaps the project organization is\n&gt; a part of using JUnit successfully.\n&gt; \n&gt; Charles\n&gt; \n\nthese examples are *really* helpful. I have only been doing unit testing\n(for each class) for a few months. and trying to figure out how to organize\nthe directory structures in cvs and ant to facilitate the different levels\nof testing is still a puzzle (reading ant in anger ant java tools for xp).\nSo please keep the examples coming!\n\nthanks\n\n\n\n",
