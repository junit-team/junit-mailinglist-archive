It also encourages\ndevelopers to\nproduce fully working, integrated and unit tested code from day one.\n\nSo I&#39;m not sure where your impression is coming from; to me it doesn&#39;t\nsound\nlike a team where that can happen really has groked Agile software\ndevelopment.\n\n\n&gt; In my experience the project managers\n&gt; for sprints do not understand the need for engineering specs,\n&gt; hence they do not exist, or if they do they are after the\n&gt; fact.\n\nI&#39;m not sure what you mean by &quot;engineering specs&quot;, but I also don&#39;t\nunderstand why the project manager has to understand their need for them\nto\nbe produced at the right time. It&#39;s the responsibility of the team to\nproduce what is needed when it&#39;s needed.\n[Bob Bondi] Engineering specs derive from product requirements. A simple\nexample is the login screen. \nA requirement states users must login in to the system.\nAn engineer codes for that case as well as the bad username or bad\npassword or the forgotten password. \nThis simple case is a 3 to 1 fan out of the requirement. In more complex\ncode the fanouts are not \ndiscussed in engineering requirements. The QA team has no clue (in some\ncases) how to properly test. \nGood whitebox can overcome this but you bump into short sprints and the\ntime to whitebox is not there. \n\n&gt; There is no time in the plan for rework of bad code.\n\nIf you need time in the plan for rework, you are not doing enough of it.\nRefactoring, as we call reworking code in small very controlled steps,\nshould be part of the developers minute-to-minute work. They should be\ndoing\nso much of it, so tightly intermingled with the rest of their work, that\nit&#39;s impossible to measure how much of their time they are spending\ndoing\nit.\n\n&gt; There is no time in the sprint for rigorous QA.\n\nQA should be an ongoing effort during the sprint, parallel to the rest\nof\nthe work. If there is &quot;no time&quot; for this, the team really is not a truly\nAgile one.\n[Bob Bondi] This assumes the team delivers code that can be tested\nbeyond Unit testing. If so, I agree. \n\n&gt; This leads to quantity not quality.\n\nAgreed. But it has nothing to do with Agility.\n[Bob Bondi] I&#39;ll be on the back burner for awhile watching how this\nprocess works. I do not want to \nbecome reactionary about it, only to be &#39;agile&#39; enough to really provide\nthe testing customers demand \nprior to receiving products. \n\n&gt; Remember that satellite that crashed in the\n&gt; planet Mars because different methods of measuring speed were\n&gt; used. Effective integration testing would have caught that problem.\n\nAs would have better communication and collaboration. That hardly was an\nAgile project, was it? ;)\n[Bob Bondi] communication and collaboration: my points exactly restated\nso eloquently! \n\nCheers, Ilja\n[Bob Bondi] Back at ya :) \n\n\n\n________________________________\n\nYAHOO!
