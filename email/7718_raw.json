We separate the test cases in an own package. Is that best\n&gt;    practice?\n\nIt&#39;s generally a matter of taste, except...\n\n&gt;    2. When doing this, some methods with default (package) visiblilty\n&gt;    cannot be accessed. But when using the Reflection API, this methods\n&gt;    can be accessed. Is it okay to use the reflection? Or is it bad\n&gt;    style?\n\n... when your public API has the benefit of being package private, I\nthink it makes sense to put tests in the same package structure.  That\ndoesn&#39;t mean they have to live in the same physical directory though. \nYou could group tests in their own top level directory and prod. code in\nits own.  With this you can keep the same exact package structures in\nboth but tests don&#39;t get mixed into prod. code, if that matters to you.\n\n&gt;    3. What about testing private methods? It is normally not possible\n&gt;    if the test is in an own class. But again I can use the reflection\n&gt;    to acess private methods. Should I do that? Or should I only test\n&gt;    methods with public access?\n&gt;    Maybe this question has been asked. But I have problems\n&gt;    understanding the nature of the search results in this forum.\n\nIn general, I think testing private methods is really a violation of the\nobject.  If you are testing its public API (note the answer to #2), you\nare really testing everything under the covers vicariously.  This gives\nyou the freedom of keeping the API but changing the implementation.\n\n--\n=jason\n[:question | ^One]\n\n",
