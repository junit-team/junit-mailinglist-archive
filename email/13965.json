My concern is that however you <br/>\ndo it:<br/>\n<br/>\n1. You may well need to print out more details than can easily fit in an <br/>\nassert failure message in order to reproduce the problem.<br/>\n<br/>\n2. You should probably statically generate the test cases once before <br/>\nthe test suite is run rather than every time the test suite is run.<br/>\n<br/>\nJUnit is designed to run repeatedly. It is designed to let you know when <br/>\nyou broke something that was working before. Anything beyond that and <br/>\nyou&#39;ll find yourself working against the API rather than with it. That&#39;s <br/>\nfine, of course. One tool does not fit all needs. What makes JUnit a <br/>\ngood tool for unit testing makes it inappropriate for algorithmically <br/>\ngenerating test data.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne particular code smell I encounter frequently is when JUnit suites <br/>\nhave lots (or any) System.out.println() statements. That normally <br/>\nindicates someone is trying to get more data out of JUnit tests than <br/>\nthey&#39;re really intended to produce. It&#39;s even worse if these statements <br/>\nprint when the tests are passing as well as failing. In this case, <br/>\nactual failures are likely to get swamped by the usual output and may <br/>\nwell not be noticed, especially when running from Ant or the <br/>\ntextui.TestRunner so there&#39;s no red bar. Honestly I think the standard <br/>\nAnt JUnit task produces too much output already. I only want to see <br/>\ntests that failed. I want line of output at most if all tests passed.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nElliotte Rusty Harold  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:elharo@...\">elharo@...</a><br/>\nXML in a Nutshell 3rd Edition Just Published!<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.cafeconleche.org/books/xian3/\">http://www.cafeconleche.org/books/xian3/</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0596007647/cafeaulaitA/ref=nosim\">http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0596007647/cafeaulaitA/ref=nosim</a></div>",
