    "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-167227999\">Hi,<br/>\n<br/>\nI have tried spreadsheet example in several TDD courses and actually<br/>\nit didn&#39;t worked out so well. Spreadsheet application was a starting<br/>\npoint and then we moved into a complicated J2EE example.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe problem in this course setup is the amount of material<br/>\nparticipants have to swallow and tolerate and little technical details<br/>\nthat are coming into the game. Most of the people coming into theses<br/>\ncourses are not some J2EE or Struts gurus, which can easily work with<br/>\nany setup you offer in the course. They do some changes now and then<br/>\nand some others are taking care of the rest. Environmental details<br/>\nshouldn&#39;t block them from seeing the TDD benefits. They may even think<br/>\nlater on that the course was all about the testing environment setup<br/>\nor something really technical, but that shouldn&#39;t be the case!<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m suggesting that TDD courses should stick with the simple examples<br/>\nlike spreadsheet. This way the actual TDD idea is visible all the time<br/>\nand not the technical details.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne problem still is that most professional programmers don&#39;t want to<br/>\nspend time with trivial things like spreadsheet applications, if they<br/>\ndon&#39;t see some fundamental reasons for doing it. They want to see how<br/>\nall happends in their build environment and with same size projects<br/>\nthat they deal with.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis means that you have to sell the idea with concrete examples and<br/>\nexperiences, before doing anything.<br/>\n<br/>\nTeppo<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On 5/20/05, Mike Clark &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mike@...\">mike@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; How about Bill Wake&#39;s Spreadsheet idea &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.xp123.com/xplor/\">http://www.xp123.com/xplor/</a> <br/>\n&gt; &gt; xp0201/&gt;?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Just to share what has worked well for me...<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; In my TDD workshop we start with the Spreadsheet and then move on to  <br/>\n&gt; a shopping cart application, just to give a couple different  <br/>\n&gt; perspectives.
