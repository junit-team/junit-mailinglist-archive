It is possible to have 100% line <br/>\n&gt;coverage and still have a defect because you have not written code <br/>\n&gt;to handle a particular case.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; <br/>\n&gt;&gt; I do not like test coverage measurement. It is not smart enough. <br/>\n&gt;Obviously, 90% coverage is much better than 50% coverage, but the <br/>\n&gt;return on investment goes down considerably up over 90%. My opinion.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; <br/>\n&gt;&gt; Take care.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I have no real practical interest in this. It is theoretical <br/>\n&gt;curiosity.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;You are right with the 100% objection. I meant a measure which <br/>\n&gt;covers everything. If all tests are written to the results of that <br/>\n&gt;measure and the tests are all green then I think it is proven that <br/>\n&gt;there are no bugs in the code (if the test has no bugs itself).<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>If you measure X then you get X, no matter what X is. If you measure lines of code, you get more code. If you measure branch coverage, you get tests that cover more branches, whether those branches are actually useful is immaterial. That&#39;s why I only like one message: Features the Customer Likes that Work.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Thats what I am looking for. The super duper measure.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Any idea?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>No, because Test-Driven Development guarantees sufficiently high coverage, so I haven&#39;t found measuring test coverage to be useful. That&#39;s just personal taste.<br/>\n<br/>\nTake care.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nJ. B.
