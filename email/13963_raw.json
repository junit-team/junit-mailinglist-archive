A lot of programs work based on random generations, so it\n&gt; should come as no surprise that tests can do that as well, as long as the\n&gt; failure can be reproduced when it occurs.\n&gt; \n\nI think we&#39;re in agreement here, but I don&#39;t think this is what the \noriginal poster was suggesting. I&#39;m OK with randomly selecting data from \na large input set (too large to test exhaustively) for testing provided \nthat the selection is done prior to the construction of the unit test \nsuite. i.e. from the generated tests you want to pick out any tests that \nfail and explicitly add them to the unit test suite. This is a \nreasonable thing to do, but it&#39;s not something that JUnit really lends \nitself to.\n\nI think the original request was top randomly pick test data as part of \nthe test suite itself, and I think that&#39;s a bad idea. At worst you&#39;re \ngoing to see unreproducible failures. At best, you&#39;re going to get a \nfailure with enough information about the input data to enable you to \nhand construct a reproducible version if anybody&#39;s actually looking that \nclosely at the results, which often they aren&#39;t. For instance, if I busy \noptimizing and debugging in package foo I may ignore test failures that \nrandomly occur in package bar.\n\nAnother problem: the normal response to a test failure following a code \nchange is to look at that change and see how that modification caused \nthe problem. With random test data there&#39;s simply no guarantee that the \nlast change did indeed cause the test failure. the failure could have \nexisted completely independently of the change you made.\n\nYou can work around all these issues of course; but really, why should \nyou? None of this is what JUnit (or unit testing in general) was \ndesigned to do . There are simpler, easier ways to solve this problem \nthat don&#39;t involve running different tests every time you type &quot;java \njunit.text.ui.TestRunner foo.bar.TestSuite.&quot;\n\n-- \nElliotte Rusty Harold  elharo@...\nXML in a Nutshell 3rd Edition Just Published!\nhttp://www.cafeconleche.org/books/xian3/\nhttp://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0596007647/cafeaulaitA/ref=nosim\n\n",
