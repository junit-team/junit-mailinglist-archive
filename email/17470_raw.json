Sometimes the effort is not  \nworth the payback, but you have to at least consider what it would  \ntake.  Simply saying &quot;I can&#39;t test it&quot; without exploring how it could  \nbe tested is a cop-out.\n\nThe first barrier is usually ignorance.  I don&#39;t know how or what I  \nwould test.\nThe second, is environment and tool support.  This isn&#39;t an issue  \nwith Java.\n\nSome things may be hard to test, some may just require some kinds of  \nthinking you haven&#39;t done before.\n\nFor instance, I have a component that paints on top of another.  I&#39;m  \nnot going to test the exact image produced by a complex combination  \nof transparencies, but I can get mileage out of filling the decorator  \na solid color and ensuring the corners of the bounds of the decorator  \nshow up the right color.\n\nI&#39;ve implemented a host of custom UI components, whose response to  \nuser input can be tested with native OS events, stuffing the java  \nevent queue, or pushing them programmatically.\n\nThere are links to several JUnit-based UI testing tools at junit.org  \nand http://groups.yahoo.com/groups/java-gui-testing\n\n\n\n\nOn Aug 16, 2006, at 1:06 PM, Altman, Joel G.
