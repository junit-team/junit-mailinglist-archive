We<br/>\nare now looking at Agitator and trying to determine if, and how, it<br/>\nfits into our current practices.  I was wondering how others have<br/>\ndecided to use Agitator (or not use it).  Some of the issues we are<br/>\nstruggling with:<br/>\n<br/>\n1.  Agitator looks like it can eliminate the need to write most JUnit<br/>\ntests (except true persistence testing).  The downside is that we<br/>\nwould be left with only Agitator config files that contain our<br/>\nbusiness logic assertions.  This seems like a big leap to take, given<br/>\nthat if Agitar goes away, we have no JUnit.<br/>\n<br/>\n2.  Agitator mocks and factories look easy to create, but look like<br/>\nthey are only useful in the context of Agitator.  I couldn&#39;t use them<br/>\nfor other purposes (e.g. Fitnesse, JUnit).<br/>\n<br/>\n3.  Having my business logic tests in JUnit means they are in an<br/>\nunderstood format and things such as inputs and expected results are<br/>\nclearly visible and grouped with each test.  My impression of<br/>\nAgitator is that this wouldn&#39;t be as clear.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYahoo! Groups Links </span></blockquote></div>",
