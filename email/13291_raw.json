I agree that test data allows complete control over the content - the challenge being to make sure that it is realistic.\n\n-------------- Original message -------------- \n\nWe test various ERP programs, like purchasing demand calculation \n(complex business logic).\n\nI think it is a better approach to use test data which cover the \nvarious use cases or boundaries instead of real data. With &quot;test data&quot; \nI mean data which I create in my test program and which I persist in \nthe database. After the test finished, I delete the test data (with an \nEntityGarbageCollector).\n\nBut our new project leader thinks we should use only real data (&quot;one \ndataset for all tests&quot;). I don&#39;t think that this would work. We need \nboth strategies I think, even if one solution seems to be redundant.\n\nTo only use real test data has big disadvantages in my opinion:\n- if data changes (real data does), then tests break\n- you need much more real data than test data to cover all the \nboundaries and use cases\n- if you add real data or remove real data from the dataset, tests \nmight break\n\nWhat do you think about it?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYahoo!
