Sometimes you can do\nthis simply by setting creating the state in setUp(), sometimes it&#39;s\nbetter to replace you test against with something you have more control\nover (that is, mock it). After all, you want to test the classes which\nuse the server, not the server itself, don&#39;t you?\n\nCheers, Ilja\n\n\n",
