With tests in the same package but in different\nproject subtrees, the view looks like this:\n\n- ... &#92;src&#92;main\n   - com\n      - &lt;company&gt;\n         + &lt;pkg1&gt;\n         + &lt;pkg2&gt;\n\n- ... &#92;src&#92;test\n   - com\n      - &lt;company&gt;\n         + &lt;pkg1&gt;\n         + &lt;pkg2&gt;\n\nWith all that I&#39;ve heard about Eclipse, I&#39;m surprised this type of view\nis not present.  I would highly recommend IDEA if you choose to explore\nother IDEs.  By the way, I rely on Ant to exclude test classes from the\nmain jar file; works nicely.\n\nRegards,\nCraig\n\n&gt; &gt; Why don&#39;t you like keeping your tests in the same package scope,\n&gt; &gt; but (optionally) in a physically separate directory ?\n\n&gt; One reason that I don&#39;t like it too much is that I cannot see the\n&gt; application code and the test code side by side in my package browser\n- at\n&gt; least not in Eclipse. That&#39;s why I prefer to have both classes and\ntest\n&gt; classes in the same source tree as long as the code is in a constantly\n&gt; changing state. I move the test classes out as soon as the code is in\n&gt; &quot;almost stable&quot; state. Of course, I&#39;d prefer the browser to merge\nseveral\n&gt; source paths into a single view.\n&gt; \n&gt; Johannes\n\n\n",
