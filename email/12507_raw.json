You have to recompile your code\n&gt; when you want to change the test data. \n\nThis is entirely untrue. See Scott Stirling&#39;s good work in Chapter 5 of \n_JUnit Recipes_.\n\n &gt; And another issue is\n&gt; there are some features desired by developers while not\n&gt; included in the framework, you have to use extra extensions\n&gt; to do something such as logging, result recording...\n\nYou seem to frame this like a downside. Frameworks /should/ be light and \nsupplemented by extension. That&#39;s what a good framework is; and not a \nsuite of tools that do everything. That&#39;s a /platform/.\n\n&gt; To solve these problems, I create a new testing framework\n&gt; which separate test code and data, it&#39;s called &quot;Jetif&quot;.\n&gt; The Jetif is designed for the purpose that to provides a\n&gt; powerful and flexiable testing framework with many of\n&gt; features which developers desired.\n&gt; \n&gt; There is a short article to compare Jetif and JUnit+JTestCase:\n&gt; http://jetif.sourceforge.net/comparison.html\n&gt; \n&gt; Please visit http://sourceforge.net/projects/jetif/\n&gt; for more information.\n\nIt looks like a good project; but I&#39;d prefer you didn&#39;t malign JUnit \nwith false statements.\n\nQ: Why not extend JUnit with the very best data-driven suite mechanism \non the planet? The market would love that.\n\nTake care.\n-- \nJ. B.
