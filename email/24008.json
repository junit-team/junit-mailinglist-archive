I&#39;ll ask again on our mailing list and see what the consensus is. CPL is actually accepted if it&#39;s included in a binary form. Is that easy to do?<br/>\n(I&#39;m new to java/java build systems and just agreed to check all the licensing stuff is in order, I do know other languages so i&#39;m not completely clueless however)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a>, Stephen Connolly &lt;stephen.alan.connolly@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; There are loads of apache projects using junit.
