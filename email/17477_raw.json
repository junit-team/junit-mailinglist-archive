Please suggest that your GUI developer take a deep breath\nand think relaxing thoughts. You could also suggest that they try\nchanting &quot;google is my friend&quot;.\n\n&gt; Point: Does JUnit have a GUI Development IDE?. With Drag and Drop\n&gt; features?.\n\nNo.\n\n&gt; That&#39;s why I said I am plying with netBeans and/or Java Studio 8. By the\n&gt; way Java Studio 8 is built on netBeans. netBeans do have the Graphical\n&gt; Drag and Drop Features to Build the GUIs Soon, than by laying out the\n&gt; interface by hand.\n&gt;\n&gt; I will be glad if he can tell me how to do this in Junit (point above).\n&gt; I can then forget netBeans or anything else.\n&gt;\n&gt; -Kumar&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Joel Altman\n&gt; Shuttle Training Aircraft Project\n\nYour GUI developer needs a different tool than JUnit for their GUI\ntesting. I don&#39;t write GUI&#39;s, so I can&#39;t help in any way other than\nsuggesting that the good folks at google may be of help.\n\nSimon\n\n-- \nwww.simonpeter.org\n\n",
