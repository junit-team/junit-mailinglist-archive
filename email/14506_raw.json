Let&#39;s try something a bit better...\n\nFor any given problem, a number of designs can be found. A certain \npercentage of these will be easy to test. Another percentage will be \nhard to test. If you want to be able to use tests to verify your design, \nit is reasonable to alter your design to fall in the &quot;easy-to-test&quot; zone.\n\nDesigns built with testing in mind from day one will, almost by \ndefinition, be easy to test. This is not a surprising characteristic - \nafter all, they&#39;ve been shaped with &quot;ease-of-testing&quot; as a constraint. \nDesigns built without testing in mind will probably be hard to test, \nmaybe even &quot;de-testable&quot;.\n\nWhenver you make a design, you are balancing various constraints, \nforcees, and fears. The &quot;private method&quot; one is a classic: you don&#39;t \nwant to make the method public, because it may be abused. You don&#39;t want \nto extract a new class for the method to live on because it means \nyet-another-class to clutter up your application. You don&#39;t want to make \nit private, because it&#39;s hard to test.\n\nBalancing these forces is what leads to a good design, normally. Taking \neasy ways out (such as using reflection to access private methods) tends \nto result in imbalanced forces and designs that aren&#39;t as good, _in my \nexperience_.\n\nIn this particular situation, my normal technique is to extract to a \npackage-level class. What I tend to end up with is a few public classes \n(about what you&#39;d normally expect), with a lot more package-level \nclasses that JavaDoc doesn&#39;t show off. It seems to work for me. It also \nmeans I usually have lots of smallish classes, which seems to be a \ncommon trait to good OO projects.\n\nRobert.\n\n\n",
