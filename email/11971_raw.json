Is there better way?\n&gt; \n&gt; I think your approach is quite correct. Of course the test won&#39;t compile\n&gt; until the Book class is written.\n&gt; First step is to write the test (which you have done).\n&gt; Next step is to compile the test -- the students need to realize they\n&gt; need to write the beginning of the Book class with the appropriate\n&gt; constructor and method signatures. \n&gt; \n&gt; Next step is to make the test pass by adding sufficient logic to the\n&gt; methods.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Hope you can help. \n&gt; \n&gt; I hope this did.  This is the approach I take in writing virtually all\n&gt; my code now days. It works extremely well. \n&gt; \n&gt; Frank\n&gt; \n&gt; -- \n&gt; Frank Burough &lt;fburough@...&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; Yahoo!
