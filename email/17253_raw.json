However, trying to filter on\nmore t=\r\nhan one method doesn&#39;t seem to be intuitively obvious, and\nnothing really s=\r\neems to work.\n\nThe code I use to get one test to run is as follows (it&#39;s fr=\r\nom the\ntest class&#39;s main() method):\n    JUnitCore core =3D new JUnitCore();=\r\n\n    Request testRequest =3D Request.method(aTestClass, someArguments[0]);\n=\r\n    core.run(testRequest);\n\nI have no idea how to extend this model to bein=\r\ng able to specify\nmultiple methods, however.\n\nIn addition, I really hope th=\r\nat someone starts documenting all of the\nnifty new features in JUnit 4.x - =\r\nthe current level is somewhat\n(frustratingly) incomplete. The basic feature=\r\ns have been covered by a\nnumber of writers - the more complex, such as this=\r\n issue, still seem\nto be missing.\n\nI think JUnit has the potential to becom=\r\ne even more popular with a\nclearer examination of the framework on which it=\r\n is built. There seems\nto be a great deal of power and flexibility availabl=\r\ne - it&#39;s just\nreally unclear as to how to get at it.\n\nThanks in advance!\n\nM=\r\nichael Schechter\n\n--- In junit@yahoogroups.com, David Saff &lt;saff@...&gt; wrote=\r\n:\n&gt;\n&gt; Shannon,\n&gt; \n&gt; You are right--this doesn&#39;t currently work in JUnit 4.1=\r\n.  Could you\nopen \n&gt; a tracker issue on the sourceforge page, and we&#39;ll see=\r\n if this can be \n&gt; remedied in a future version?  Thanks,\n&gt; \n&gt;     David Sa=\r\nff\n&gt; \n&gt; Shannon wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Greetings,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m trying to filter a JUnit =\r\n3.8x test case class using the 4.1\n&gt; &gt; runner, so that only one of the test=\r\n methods in the class is run and\n&gt; &gt; the others are ignored. I create and r=\r\nun the test like this:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Request r =3D Request.method(OldStyleTestCas=\r\ne.class, &quot;testSomeMethod&quot;);\n&gt; &gt; jcore.run(r);\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The outcome is that a=\r\nll test methods are run, not just the one test\n&gt; &gt; method I specified. I al=\r\nso tried using a custom filter, but the filter\n&gt; &gt; never gets called becaus=\r\ne the runner for this class is\n&gt; &gt; org.junit.internal.runners.OldTestClassR=\r\nunner which does not implement\n&gt; &gt; Filter.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Do I need to write my ow=\r\nn runner to get this to work? Is there another\n&gt; &gt; work around?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Tha=\r\nnks for any help.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; /Shannon\n\n\n\n\n\n",
