Short ans=\r\nwer is I\nthink Agitator & JUnit are complementary TDD or no. (I&#39;ll leave it=\r\n to\nsomeone else to make the point that of course you should use TDD.  I\nag=\r\nree with them, but that isn&#39;t your question.)\n\nLonger answer is that when y=\r\nou use JUnit TDD there are (at least) two\ndifferent kinds of value you get,=\r\n design and correctness. It is the\ncorrectness aspect that Robert Martin is=\r\n talking about when he\ncompares TDD to double entry bookkeeping. It answers=\r\n the question\n&quot;does my algorithm work? does input a combined with input b g=\r\nive me\nexactly output c?&quot; JUnit tests give you this kind of confidence.\n\nAg=\r\nitator is more about limits and bounds and did your algorithm, which\nyou al=\r\nready know works correctly on the happy path, unexpectedly blow\nup in some =\r\ncases. Or leave the object in an illegal state? Or return a\nnon-sensical va=\r\nlue? or... Agitation is also good for &quot;does input of\ncategory A with input =\r\nof category B always give me output of category\nC?&quot; If I were looking for a=\r\n word to compare to correctness I&#39;d\nprobably have to choose robustness.\n\nSo=\r\n would I recommend JUnit + Agitator over just simply Agitator?  Heck\nyeah! =\r\nand I&#39;ve already done so many times on (both in person and on my\nblog) alre=\r\nady.  :)\n\nJtf\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
