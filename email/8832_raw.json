[...]\n\n  So you have two main test suites.\n\n  1. Object-level tests.\n  2. Integration tests.\n\n  This necessarily means that you do not have the benefit of &quot;one defect,\none failure&quot;, since likely you always have &quot;one defect, at least two\nfailures&quot;.\n\nNo, I have a complex hierarchy.\n\n  &gt;Since\n  &gt;I can&#39;t control the order of execution (it is likely package alphabetical\n  &gt;or\n  &gt;something), I can&#39;t tell what is the lowest level test. I&#39;d like to\nreduce\n  &gt;the effort invested here.\n\n  This is a myth. You *can* control the order of execution of test and of\ntest suites; you simply have to maintain suites.\n\nAs  I said above, I know I *probably* could do it with suites ... BUT. As I\nrefactor, as code grows, the suites (being separate from the tests) are .\nbut that seems a level of manual effort/management that is counter\nproductive -- and hence counter testing. IMHO anything that can be better\ndone by a computer ought be done by a computer.\n\nSay I have an object X that aggregates Y and Z I want X to depend upon Y\ntests and Z tests. What suite would I create? Also, say I have A that\naggregate B and C -- with finally an object aggregating X and A. What if A\nstarted using X? Trying to manage suites to represent this hierarchy seems\nnightmarish.\n\nI would like to be able to set X to depend upon Y/Z (almost a &quot;dynamic\nsuite&quot;) and set A on Y and Z. Then, if A started using X I&#39;d just have to\nset A to depend upon X to get the desire hierarchy. [Doing this in the\noriginal class might be nicer still, but I&#39;ve not yet thought how to tie\ntests with classes so tightly (and be efficient).]\n\nIs what I am discussing unreasonable? It seems an easy interface for users,\nand something that junit could manage behind the scenes.\n\n[Gosh, if the Eclipse junit wizard did this for me via class introspection,\nthat&#39;d be a beautiful thing...]\n\n  &gt;P.S. The Eclipse junit plugin that search projects to find all tests,\nfind\n  &gt;tests in dependant project, but doesn&#39;t run them &quot;in the CWD of that\n  &gt;project&quot; (which matters for some tests).\n\n  It shouldn&#39;t. It is best to write your tests so that it doesn&#39;t. Or your\nproduction code; whichever. Pass the desired working directory into the\ntests as a JVM parameter or something.\n\n\nI might agree with you, but I am testing ant tasks -- that process XML\nfiles -- and it seems wholly reasonable that they read them from a file.\nSince I am subclassing from the test utility that ant provides for this, I\nhave to use the file mechanism they provide. Also, since I am not launching\nthe junit (Eclipse is) I don&#39;t have the JVM control you state -- especially\nwhen it is choosing to run tests from multiple projects.\n\nI guess I&#39;ll file a bug report/enhancement request and see what luck I get.\n\nregards,\n\nAdam\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n",
