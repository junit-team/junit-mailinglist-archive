I agree with you, that thinking <br/>\nabout a test before implementing the according part of <br/>\nthe application is very important. <br/>\n<br/>\nI understand you refuse to write a compilable but hollow <br/>\nmethod of an application method before you write the test. <br/>\n(This would make the use of a test stub generator impossible.) <br/>\n<br/>\nThere I don&#39;t agree. I like the documentation aspect of code <br/>\nrelated tests. This kind of tests enable me to look at a test <br/>\nin order to understand the intention of an application method. <br/>\nThis is very important to me. JUnitDoclet is helping me to <br/>\nkeep application structure and test structure in sync, which <br/>\nis essential there. Still I can _implement_ the test method <br/>\nbefore I _implement_ the application method. <br/>\n<br/>\nI believe the core idea of &quot;test before code&quot; is <br/>\npossible with _regenerating_ tools like JUnitDoclet. <br/>\nIt just requires some self control.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter all, this is not a major dissagreement. If there <br/>\nwouldn&#39;t be that documenting aspect of tests...<br/>\n<br/>\nRegards,<br/>\n<br/>\nSteffen Gemkow</div>",
