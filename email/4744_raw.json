I used the same license specifically to allow for this.  But that \nshould only happen if it&#39;s found useful for unit testing.  If it aides \nfunctional testing specifically, there is a now a place to put that \nfunctionality to share with the rest of the community.\n\nThere will, of course, be gray areas, but what&#39;s nice about these \nextensions is you can use whichever portion you need/want without \nbloating the original framework.\n\nI do have to wonder though, does anyone make use of the Assert class&#39; \nstatic nature?  (Let&#39;s restrict the responses to all the &#39;nays&#39; rather \nthan the &#39;yays.&#39;)  I&#39;ve only used asserts through JUnit&#39;s TestCase.\n\n-shane\n\nOn Monday, April 22, 2002, at 06:02  PM, dvydra2 wrote:\n\n&gt; We had to change all methods in Assert class from static to instance\n&gt; for functional testing, the same approach as JFunc.
