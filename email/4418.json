    "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1207548197\"><blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">&gt; Test generators are not really geared for functional *black* box <br/>\n&gt; testing, I agree, but they can be excellent for *white* box efforts.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>The problem I have is in the word &quot;testing&quot;.  Having generated tests and <br/>\nachieve 100% statement coverage don&#39;t proof that you have tested what <br/>\nyour application _must_ do.  Even in a white box effort, you still have <br/>\nto go through all your tests to validate them.  Example:<br/>\n<br/>\n    /**<br/>\n     * @throws IllegalArgumentException if argument is null<br/>\n     */<br/>\n    public void toto(Integer tata) {<br/>\n       if (tata == null)<br/>\n          throw new IllegalStateArgument();<br/>\n       ...<br/>\n    }<br/>\n<br/>\nyou can achieve 100% coverage with a generated test, but this test will <br/>\nnot validate your program (because you don&#39;t throw the right exception). <br/>\n  You will then have to go through _all_ your tests to validate them.<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course you will review every single test and you will end up with a <br/>\nset of valid tests.  But I doubt that everyone will be so careful.  And <br/>\nbecause all the tests pass, you don&#39;t know where to start (no error to <br/>\nfix), so you&#39;ll take class number 1 and review the tests, class numer 2...<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; This can help identify impossible paths in your <br/>\n&gt; code, as well as rare paths that lead to exceptions (such as null pointers).<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I already thought of that and I think that a simple tool to discover <br/>\nnull pointers could be helpful.  It can be a special TestCase of another <br/>\nJUnit.  But I don&#39;t think that if you generate &quot;validation&quot; tests for <br/>\nJUnit, you should reuse these tests as the basis for your &quot;unit&quot; tests.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut I&#39;m ready to be convinced<br/>\n<br/>\n-Vladimir<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nVladimir Bossicard<br/>\nwww.bossicard.com</div>",
