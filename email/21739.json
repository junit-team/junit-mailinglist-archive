I can&#39;t quite tell what the issue is, but it seems that maybe IDEA and/or TeamCity is not always reporting all of the errors when there is a multiple exception scenario.  I was doing some testing after my original post, and the behavior was inconsistent.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Regardless, am I missing anything here with respect to a way to assert state after any test in a class is run?  I&#39;ve seen many posts where people preach about not asserting in tearDown/@After, but no one seems to offer any alternatives.  Is this simply something not currently available in JUnit?  If not, I wonder if this is something the current maintainers would consider useful.  Maybe an @AfterAssert or something that notes a method that should be run after the test only if the test did not have any assertion failures itself.<br/>\n<br/>\nRegards,<br/>\nPaul<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a>, David Saff &lt;david@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Can you use JUnit 4?
