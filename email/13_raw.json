The JUnit\nGUI requires fully-qualified class names, e.g., &quot;summarizer.TestSummarizer&quot;.\nThe classpath should then point one level up from the &quot;summarizer&quot; package\ndirectory.  (Should be fine as-is from JBuilder, though, I think; I&#39;ve not\nused JBuilder, though, so I&#39;m not sure.)\n\nIf that&#39;s not it, I&#39;m pretty confused too!  Have you tried using the\n-classpath command line option instead of the environment variable?\n\n---\nBen Schroeder\nschroeder@...\n\n\n",
