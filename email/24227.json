Its been about 5yrs since I made a significant part<br/>\n&gt; of my living from writing code. Instead I spend most of my time and effort<br/>\n&gt; coaching and training clients on the basic Agile ideas. In the past few<br/>\n&gt; weeks I&#39;ve spent a lot of time with a client that builds Java applications.<br/>\n&gt; This has brought me back to JUnit.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m in shock, you&#39;re discussing how to use Lambda&#39;s well when some of the<br/>\n&gt; basic elements are hard to use correctly. Examples Categories - require a<br/>\n&gt; special runner and the use of suites; Parameterized Data - requires a<br/>\n&gt; special runner etc.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The Categories is the worst one. The client had some slow tests that should<br/>\n&gt; be removed from their main unit test suite and run only on nightly builds.<br/>\n&gt; Over time they want to revisit the tests, speed them up (using Fake DB and<br/>\n&gt; In Memory streams etc). In the world of Nunit no problem we would just mark<br/>\n&gt; them as members of the category slow and run them separately on the build<br/>\n&gt; server. In JUnit the requirement to use suites for this capability was so<br/>\n&gt; painful that we just migrated the tests to a separate eclipse project.<br/>\n&gt; Their parameterized tests several were missing the annotations for the<br/>\n&gt; special test runner. There are a number of other small details where JUnit<br/>\n&gt; makes it a little harder than necessary to do the work.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Suggestion before debating an attractive Lambda syntax, make the existing<br/>\n&gt; features easy to use. In addition take NUnit for spin you might find some<br/>\n&gt; good ideas on how to handle many of these details.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --<br/>\n&gt; Cheers<br/>\n&gt; Mark Levison<br/>\n&gt; Agile Pain Relief Consulting <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://agilepainrelief.com/notesfromatooluser\">http://agilepainrelief.com/notesfromatooluser</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; | Writing <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://agilepainrelief.com/notesfromatooluser/\">http://agilepainrelief.com/notesfromatooluser/</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Proud Sponsor of Agile Tour Gatineau Ottawa <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://goagiletour.ca/\">http://goagiletour.ca/</a>&gt; Nov<br/>\n&gt; 28, Toronto <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.torontoagilecommunity.org/display/PUBLIC/Home\">http://www.torontoagilecommunity.org/display/PUBLIC/Home</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 26 and Montreal <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://agilemontreal.ca/agile-tour-2012/\">http://agilemontreal.ca/agile-tour-2012/</a>&gt; 24<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nMaybe she awoke to see the roommate&#39;s boyfriend swinging from the<br/>\nchandelier wearing a boar&#39;s head.<br/>\n<br/>\nSomething which you, I, and everyone else would call &quot;Tuesday&quot;, of course.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed] </span></blockquote></div>",
