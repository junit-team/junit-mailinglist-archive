Simply because it depends.  Sometimes you want to <br/>\n&gt; test protected methods, sometimes you don&#39;t.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; My point is: placing tests classes so that it is _impossible_ to test <br/>\n&gt; protected methods is a &quot;bad&quot; decision because you restrict your <br/>\n&gt; flexibility.  By placing test classes in the same package, you still <br/>\n&gt; have that flexibility, but you don&#39;t have to use it if you don&#39;t want to.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Well said. Here&#39;s my own phrasing of it... even if *in general* you only <br/>\ntest the public interface, there will be times when public bugs are <br/>\ncaused by protected/private methods. In that case, you want to write <br/>\nunit tests for the protected methods, in order to isolate the problem <br/>\nfrom the complexities and potential side effects of the public <br/>\ninterface. If you put your test classes off where they *can&#39;t* test <br/>\nprotected methods, then you have prevented yourself from using JUnit to <br/>\ntest protected methods *ever*. What&#39;s the benefit of that? Intellectual <br/>\npurity? Falling back on seat-of-the-pants debugging?<br/>\n<br/>\nPutting test classes with the main classes to enable testing protected <br/>\nmethods does not *require* that protected methods be tested. Putting <br/>\nthem in a separate package, however, makes it impossible (or at least <br/>\npossible only through a public interface redirection kludge).<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n<br/>\nDavid Stagner<br/>\n<br/>\nNational Marrow Donor Program<br/>\n3001 Broadway Street NE<br/>\nBroadway Ridge Suite 500<br/>\nMinneapolis, MN  55413<br/>\n<br/>\nEmail: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dstagner@...\">dstagner@...</a></div>",
