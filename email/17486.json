Much of the  <br/>\njava code can be written and tested in a J2SE environment.  A willing  <br/>\ndesigner could even create mockups of the ME environment sufficient  <br/>\nto allow considerable test coverage in the host environment.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have customers who complete the testing connection to their  <br/>\nembedded devices by writing unit tests on the host environment that  <br/>\nmake calls over a USB connection to a simple little program on the  <br/>\ndevice that then knows how to call into the embedded application.   <br/>\nThink of it as a very poor man&#39;s RPC.<br/>\n<br/>\nAgain, where there is a will, there is a way.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n----<br/>\nRobert C.
