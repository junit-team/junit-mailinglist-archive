It seems to me to be the\nfollowing : how to test a &quot;component&quot; model ?, i.e. how to test some\nclass that need a container to work (like Applets, EJBs, Avalon\nComponents, Servlets, etc).\n\nThere are 2 good solutions (for unit tests) :\n- in-container testing. Cactus does this for J2EE APIs\nor\n- mock objects (www.mockobjects.com) by mocking your container (beware,\nit is not the same a stubbing).\n\nNow, it really depends if you want to write unit tests (white box) or\nfunctional tests (black box).\n\n-Vincent\n\n&gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; From: Stephen Cheng [mailto:stephen.cheng@...]\n&gt; Sent: 21 March 2002 12:55\n&gt; To: Vincent Massol\n&gt; Cc: junit@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Subject: RE: [junit] Testing Complete Applications and Applets\n&gt; \n&gt; Hello Vincent,\n&gt; \n&gt; It is me, thanks for coming back. I am actually using log4j, but I\n&gt; mentioned\n&gt; system.out.writeln as a simplification.\n&gt; \n&gt; The real problem I had really is how to invoke the entire\n&gt; application/applet\n&gt; inside a test case. It is easy to write a testcase to invoke a\nparticular\n&gt; method in a particular class. However I cannot simply call the init()\nin\n&gt; the\n&gt; JApplet implementation - I need to simulate the applet life-cycle. Of\n&gt; course\n&gt; I would have to simulate the keystrokes and mouse - I am investigating\n&gt; Jemmy\n&gt; for this purpose.\n&gt; \n&gt; The situation is not as complicated with applications, since I should\nbe\n&gt; able to simply call the main() with the appropriate arguments.\n&gt; \n&gt; Regards,\n&gt; Stephen\n&gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; From: Vincent Massol [mailto:vmassol@...]\n&gt; Sent: 21 March 2002 12:19\n&gt; To: stephen.cheng@...\n&gt; Subject: RE: [junit] Testing Complete Applications and Applets\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Stephen,\n&gt; \n&gt; Are you the Stephen Cheng I met at Icom ?\n&gt; \n&gt; There are several solutions to your question.\n&gt; \n&gt; 1/ First it is not good to do System.out.println ! You should rather\nuse\n&gt; a logging toolkit. I would suggest Jakarta Commons Logging as it\n&gt; transparently let you use log4j, jdk1.4, logkit or simple logging\nusing\n&gt; system.out, I think. If you do this, then you can provide a mock\n&gt; implementation of the logger and assert whatever you want.\n&gt; \n&gt; 2/ Simply redirect the out stream to a memory stream and then compare\n&gt; the memory stream with the expected result.\n&gt; \n&gt; Hope it helps.\n&gt; -Vincent\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; &gt; From: Stephen Cheng [mailto:stephen.cheng@...]\n&gt; &gt; Sent: 21 March 2002 12:18\n&gt; &gt; To: junit@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; &gt; Subject: [junit] Testing Complete Applications and Applets\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; In additional to performing unit testing, I need to test entire\n&gt; &gt; applications\n&gt; &gt; with main() and applets with init(). [Background info: I am working\non\n&gt; a\n&gt; &gt; java software development tool] I need to compare the text output\n&gt; &gt; (system.out.writeln) of the complete application/applet against\n&gt; expected\n&gt; &gt; output. Is there someway I could do this?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; It appeared to me that I somehow need to simulate the enviroment\nthat\n&gt; a\n&gt; &gt; complete application/applet runs in. I would love to hear any\n&gt; suggestions.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Regards, Stephen\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ------------------------ Yahoo!
