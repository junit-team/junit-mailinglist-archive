Neither qingfenglin or myself received a \n&gt; ClassNotFoundException, we received LinkageError&#39;s....\n&gt; \n\nGood point.  The new FAQ will be more clear on this common problem.\n\n&gt; Actually, I don&#39;t mean to be a critic, but the documentation for \n&gt; J/Unit really sucks. I know, I know... if I don&#39;t like it I should do \n&gt; better... Well, I&#39;ve only been using J/Unit for a couple of days now \n&gt; so I&#39;m not prepared yet to write docs. As I get more involved with it \n&gt; I definately plan on putting together a couple of HOWTO&#39;s.. until \n&gt; then, I&#39;d just like to say that the docs are horrible. Great product \n&gt; (from what I&#39;ve seen so far), horrible documentation.\n&gt;\n\nWe&#39;re working on making the FAQ better.  The fact that I&#39;m digging\nthrough the archives for these nuggets says something.\n\nYou can help by asking (and answering) questions on this list, and\nproposing FAQ changes such as you did above.\n\nThanks!\n\nMike \n\n\n\n",
