One thing I feels uncomfortable about XP is pair</font>\n<br><font SIZE=\"2\">&gt; programming. As Beck wrote: &quot;Pair programming is a dialog </font>\n<br><font SIZE=\"2\">&gt; between two people trying</font>\n<br><font SIZE=\"2\">&gt; to simultaneously program and understand how to program better&quot;. But</font>\n<br><font SIZE=\"2\">&gt; how to make sure this pair&#39;s relationship cooperative instead of</font>\n<br><font SIZE=\"2\">&gt; competitive(in negative sense)?</font>\n<br><font SIZE=\"2\">&gt; For example, we can not always push two people sitting together</font>\n<br><font SIZE=\"2\">&gt; and wish they can get along and do the work more effectively than one.</font>\n<br><font SIZE=\"2\">&gt; Additionally, I always see the senior people with stronger option than</font>\n<br><font SIZE=\"2\">&gt; junior guy. Do you think it is possible to let them </font>\n<br><font SIZE=\"2\">&gt; communicating equally?</font>\n</p>\n\n<p><font SIZE=\"2\">Jason,</font>\n</p>\n\n<p><font SIZE=\"2\">First, there&#39;s an XP mailing list on yahoo-groups (extremeprogramming@yahoogroups.com) that would be more appropriate for your question.</font></p>\n\n<p><font SIZE=\"2\">Second, yes, pair programming can be _very_ practical. However, the partners do need to be willing; a negative relationship won&#39;t make it easy. In my experience, if they get forced to do it for a few weeks, they&#39;ll gel eventually and never want to go back. Also, you should remember that pairs should swap regularly; at the very least you would want a different partner for the afternoon session. This also helps to keep doing the negative relationships.</font></p>\n\n<p><font SIZE=\"2\">The junior-senior problem is another issue. Ideally, pair programming is done by peers. However, junior developers can still contribute. What I would watch out for is too much silence. If you&#39;re in a coaching role, you can hop in, get some conversation going, and try to get a flow-of-ideas. Failing that, I would try and get the junior partner to drive for a while; this will force the senior programmer to explain his/her ideas, which in turn usually gets some feedback (&quot;Why are we doing this?&quot;, etc). Remember again that the pairs will swap; if they are working on a task for the junior developer, when they swap out that afternoon (or the next morning), the junior developer will need to be able to fill his or her new partner in on the task, so they need to understand it. Make sure the junior developers sign up for tasks, and make sure they swap pairs a lot, and you&#39;ll avoid this problem.</font></p>\n\n<p><font SIZE=\"2\">I would suggest checking out some of the Pair Programming links on Ward&#39;s Wiki (try <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" HREF=\"http://www.c2.com/cgi/wiki?PairProgramming\">http://www.c2.com/cgi/wiki?PairProgramming</a>, for starters)</font></p>\n\n<p><font SIZE=\"2\">Robert.</font>\n</p>\n\n<p><font SIZE=\"2\">-- </font>\n<br><font SIZE=\"2\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Duct tape is like the Force: it has a light side, a dark side,</font>\n<br><font SIZE=\"2\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and it holds the universe together&quot;</font>\n<br><font SIZE=\"2\">&nbsp; Robert Watkins&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; robertdw@...&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; robertw@...</font>\n</p>\n\n \n</html></div>",
