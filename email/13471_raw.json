In my\n&gt; case invariably its some static data (or a rogue &quot;singleton&quot;) that&#39;s the\n&gt; root cause.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Jonathan\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ________________________________\n&gt;\n&gt; From: junit@yahoogroups.com [mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com] On Behalf Of\n&gt; J. B. Rainsberger\n&gt; Sent: 11 May 2005 01:54\n&gt; To: junit@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Subject: Re: [junit] Individual tests ok, problem in a suite\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; keirstead_james wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Hi,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;ve got a weird situation and can&#39;t figure out how to debug it.\n&gt; &gt; Perhaps someone has some advice?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I have a class called HouseholdTest.  If I run this test by itself,\n&gt; &gt; it&#39;s ok.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I also have a class suite called AgentsTestSuite which contains the\n&gt; &gt; HouseholdTest.  If I run this test, I get errors on one or two of the\n&gt; &gt; methods; i.e rerunning the test over and over again sometimes gives\n&gt; &gt; one error and sometimes two (always on the same methods).  If I use\n&gt; &gt; Rerun failed tests - Failures first, the test is ok in all\n&gt; &gt; circumstances.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; AgentsTestSuite is inside another suite called ModelTest.  Running\n&gt; &gt; this throws up errors on the same methods as above, plus another in a\n&gt; &gt; different test suite (which again is ok by itself). Rerunning failed\n&gt; &gt; tests first clears one of the methods in the HouseholdTest but that&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; it.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; What is going on here?  I&#39;ve spent quite a while debugging it but\n&gt; &gt; can&#39;t seem to figure out where the snag is.  Has anyone else\n&gt; &gt; encountered something like this?\n&gt;\n&gt; I imagine your HouseholdTest tests use some external resource (file\n&gt; system, database, something). If so, then something else in your\n&gt; AgentsTestSuite is putting that external resource in a state that your\n&gt; HouseholdTest tests doesn&#39;t expect. Clean that up, if you can.\n&gt;\n&gt; If that&#39;s not it, then I would need more specifics to get any further.\n&gt; -- \n&gt; J. B.
