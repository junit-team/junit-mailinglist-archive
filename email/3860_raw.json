The only thing you have\n&gt; to watch out for is any static code (i.e. the popular singleton\n&gt; accessor).   Email me if you need additional help.\n\nI agree. Other problems would be optimizations that &quot;distribution&quot; \ncomponents would do (such as a JMS component not sending events to \ntopic listeners in the same JVM).\nOther problems that would not be caught are serialization format \ndifferences between versions of JVMs (some JDK objects such as \njava.lang.Integer have this problem in particular :-)\n\n&gt; We use JUnit pretty extensively for our distributed application\n&gt; both as a unit test tool and as a driver for integration testing.\n&gt; We created a TestSuite which allows us to run multiple servers\n&gt; and clients in the same VM talking to each other via sockets.\n\n&gt; On a related note I saw a reply mentioning Joshua.  Since the\n&gt; code wasn&#39;t available we threw together a distributed test \n&gt; runner using NFS and SSH.  Allows us to parallelize our\n&gt; unit test runs across about a dozen boxes.   Since we do\n&gt; several integration tests using the junit framework it \n&gt; helps testing time tremendously.\n\nThis seems to be what I&#39;m looking for!\n\nDo you think your test runner could be easily reused in other UNIX-\nbased settings?\nIs it something you&#39;d be ready to share with the community and make \npublicly available? \n\nThanks,\n\nGuillaume.\n\n--- In junit@y..., Mike Schroepfer &lt;mike@r...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Hi There,\n&gt; \n&gt; We use JUnit pretty extensively for our distributed application\n&gt; both as a unit test tool and as a driver for integration testing.\n&gt; We created a TestSuite which allows us to run multiple servers\n&gt; and clients in the same VM talking to each other via sockets.\n&gt; Running in the same VM is much easier to implement and gives you\n&gt; easy control of any timing issues.
