In my testing I have not found any\n&gt; real good excuse to test a private method.\n&gt; \n&gt; Ty\n\nHmm.  I primarily use public/package-level(default)/private access to\ncommunicate which other classes should be calling this method. (And\nprotected is a whole different ball of wax.)  If you&#39;re doing open- or\nblack-box testing, then this works pretty well for providing the right\nlevel of access to your test methods.  (Well, even that&#39;s not true. \nYou can lay out your package structure to work well with\npackage-level/private distinctions, or public/private distinctions,\nbut not both.)\n\nI encounter situations, particularly ones that have heavy\nalgorithmics, where the class only exposes certain methods, but one or\nmore of those methods could benefit from being decomposed for testing\npurposes.  Usually, there is decomposition of the algorithm in the\nproduction class. Sometimes, I simply expose what might be thought of\nas private details. Sometimes, I can think of a better way to\nstructure the problem, and am not worried about exposing the\ninternals.  But sometimes, I really don&#39;t want to expose the internals\nto other production classes, but still want to be able to get at those\npoints for testing.\n\nEric\n\n\n",
