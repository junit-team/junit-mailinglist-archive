I have to admit I didn&#39;t find\nJUnitBenchmark=\r\ns in my searches. I went looking for something back in\nSeptember and again =\r\nearier this week and came up empty.\n\nAs far as what I&#39;m trying to accomplis=\r\nh, it&#39;s kind of two things.\n\nFirst, I want to microbenchmark the performanc=\r\ne of some internal data\nstructures we&#39;re experimenting with for a web frame=\r\nwork. I need to vary\nmore than one parameter for these tests: number of thr=\r\neads allowed, number\nof messages to send through it, size of those messages=\r\n, timing of the\nmessages, and more. A single test method is likely to run t=\r\nhousands of\ntimes and produce multiple 2D charts worth of data. It looks li=\r\nke Google\nCaliper (thanks for that pointer too!) may be well suited to this=\r\n task.\n\nSecond, I want to run end-to-end scalability tests in various Java =\r\nEE 6\ncontainers. These tests will have many of the same variables. For thes=\r\ne\ntests, I think Caliper is out. We&#39;re going to need Arquillian to wrangle\n=\r\nall the server setup and teardown work. Arquillian is a JUnit 4 test runner=\r\n\ntoo--I haven&#39;t thought through how to reconcile my test runner with\nArquil=\r\nlian&#39;s, but I work on the same team as the Arquillian guys, and I&#39;m\nhoping =\r\nwe can figure something out. It will probably involve pointing\nArquillian a=\r\nt my test runner, or vice-versa.\n\nThank you once again for the responses. I=\r\n really appreciate it!\n\nCheers,\n\n-Jonathan\n\nOn Thu, Dec 15, 2011 at 3:47 AM=\r\n, Dawid Weiss &lt;dawid.weiss@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt; **\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; You may want to ch=\r\neck out JUnitBenchmarks -- it does what I think you want\n&gt; to achieve:\n&gt; ht=\r\ntp://labs.carrotsearch.com/junit-benchmarks.html\n&gt;\n&gt; Dawid\n&gt;\n&gt; On Wed, Dec =\r\n14, 2011 at 11:01 PM, jfuerth &lt;jfuerth@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; **\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; Hi everyone,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;ve created a custom Runner meant to help with p=\r\nerformance and\n&gt; &gt; scalability testing. It lets you create tests like this:=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; @RunWith(PerfRunner.class)\n&gt; &gt; public class MultiThreadUsageExampl=\r\neTest {\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; @Test\n&gt; &gt; public void demonstrationTest(\n&gt; &gt; @Varying(from=\r\n=3D1, to=3D10) int threadCount,\n&gt; &gt; @Varying(from=3D100000, to=3D1000000, s=\r\ntep=3D100000) int entryCount) {\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; // code here that relies on threadC=\r\nount and entryCount\n&gt; &gt; }\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; }\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; In the above example, my runner=\r\n calls demonstrationTest() 100 times, with\n&gt; &gt; parameter values (1, 100000)=\r\n, (2, 100000), ... (1, 200000), ... (10,\n&gt; &gt; 1000000).\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; What I want =\r\nto do now is produce charts of how long each call took. There\n&gt; &gt; are a lot=\r\n of approaches, but I don&#39;t know which is &quot;right.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; 1. Register a Te=\r\nstListener and write my own reports to disk from it (but\n&gt; &gt; is there a gen=\r\neric way to register listeners?)\n&gt; &gt; 2. Create my own main program that run=\r\ns the test suite, and have it\n&gt; create\n&gt; &gt; the report when the suite is don=\r\ne (maybe this is the only way to\n&gt; register a\n&gt; &gt; TestListener anyhow?)\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n 3. Transform the XML output of the ant junit task (but then it&#39;s bound to\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; Ant)\n&gt; &gt; 4. Transform the XML output of the maven-surefure-plugin (but =\r\nthen it&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; bound to Maven)\n&gt; &gt; 5. Write performance results to disk dire=\r\nctly from my TestRunner (should\n&gt; &gt; work in any environment, but feels like=\r\n a dirty approach)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Other ideas are welcome too, of course. My test =\r\nrunner is open source and\n&gt; &gt; published on GitHub; I want a solution that c=\r\nan work for everyone. So I\n&gt; &gt; think ideas 3 and 4 are out.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Has any=\r\none else thought about getting data from custom test runners into\n&gt; &gt; human=\r\n-readable reports?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; -Jonathan\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; [Non-text portions of =\r\nthis message have been removed]\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this messag=\r\ne have been removed]\n\n\n",
