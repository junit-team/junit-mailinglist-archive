However,\n&gt;&gt; if you have a suite=\r\n() method that calls\n&gt;&gt; TestSuite.addTest(Test), which Donny did, then no s=\r\nuch &quot;automatic&quot;\n&gt;&gt; creation _should_ happen.\n&gt;\n&gt; Wow, you really had me the=\r\nre.  I didn&#39;t believe it, so I tried it.  And you\n&gt; are right.\n[snip]\n&gt; Now=\r\n, what could possibly be the justification for this behavior?!?\n\nCedric, I&#39;=\r\nve been telling you this for a year or so... Tests get\ninstantiated at the =\r\nstart (one instance per test), they are run, and\nthen, depending on the run=\r\nner, they are thrown away or reused. That&#39;s\nwhy setUp and tearDown are impo=\r\nrtant; they move expensive work to a\nlifecycle around test execution.\n\nThe =\r\njustification is for the tools. Look at the behaviour in IntelliJ\nor Eclips=\r\ne&#39;s test runners. You get a list of tests appearing, you can\nsee which one =\r\nis being executed, you can tell which ones have failed,\nand you can look at=\r\n it afterwards to see why it failed. Yes, you can\ndo it in other ways (as y=\r\nou&#39;ve done in TestNG), but that&#39;s why it was\ndone in JUnit 3. (4 also has t=\r\nhis behaviour... the test\ninvoking-object is created at the start and held =\r\naround).\n\nYou may want to re-read my JUnit Architecture Redux, Cedric...\nht=\r\ntp://twasink.net/blog/archives/2004/04/junit_architect.html.\n\nRobert.\n\n",
