It did showed a\nbeautiful repor=\r\nt with all the metrics in place, but I couldn&#39;t figure\nout what they actual=\r\nly meant.

The\n&gt; &gt; response to Crap4J was so positive that we d=\r\necided to go further and\n&gt; &gt; created a dedicated website crap4j.org &lt;http:/=\r\n/www.crap4j.\n&lt;http://www.crap4j.org&gt; org&gt; .\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; We&#39;ve had hundreds of d=\r\nownloads since we launched the site, along with\n&gt; &gt; many requests for Ant s=\r\nupport and support for IDEs other than Eclipse.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; We just added Ant s=\r\nupport in 1.1.4, and we are planning to support\nother\n&gt; &gt; IDEs like NetBean=\r\ns and IntelliJ (BTW, if you are interested in\n&gt; &gt; contribute to plug-in dev=\r\nelopment please let us know).\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; If you have a chance, please try Crap=\r\n4J on your project and let us\nknow\n&gt; &gt; what you think.
