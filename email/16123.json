I never ran appfuse but I guess I should give it a go if<br/>\nit has good testing. What I did notice is Spring had something around 3000+<br/>\ntests that varied from testing 0 classes to testing 100+ classes so I guess<br/>\nyou got a lot of different tests to look at there. Then ant also has 1000+<br/>\ntests and so on. Most I ran had around 500+ and for example velocity I think<br/>\nwas around 50 or so. Spring also runs those tests relatively fast and good<br/>\nwith little effort needed from someone who doesnt know it (that is not too<br/>\ntricky db setups etc) so I guess its ok. But I think it all depends on you<br/>\ndefinition of best practices and stuff. I dont think its too simple but I<br/>\nguess it might be im just too complicated myself :o. Also for learning<br/>\npurposes it depends who is doing the learning, in what context and with what<br/>\nbackground and lots of other stuff. If you can define what you want to see<br/>\nin it maybe it will be easier to suggest something.<br/>\n<br/>\nps since you all are going to ask what an earth is a test that tests 0<br/>\nclasses, well according to the source comments it is an empty test case<br/>\nneeded to make eclipse test runner run some tests created using inheritance<br/>\nhierarchies and so on...:)<br/>\n<br/>\n-t<br/>\n<br/>\n2006/2/15, frank zou &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:frankz1998@...\">frankz1998@...</a>&gt;:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hi all,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Lots of open-source projects are using TDD/Unit Testing. Do you have<br/>\n&gt; any ideas of which project(s) could be used to learn the &quot;BEST<br/>\n&gt; PRACTICES&quot; of using Unit Testing ?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; e.g, someone said &quot;AppFuse&quot; is cool for this purpose. Any comments and<br/>\n&gt; / or other projects ?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thanks,<br/>\n&gt; - Frank<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",
