I have tested the JBuilder TestRunner and it <br/>\nworks fine with JUnit 3.8, becuase JBuilder uses TestSuite to load the <br/>\ntests, just like the other test runners in JUnit.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you want to upgrade, there are two ways to do it:<br/>\n1. Create a library for JUnit 3.8 (you can call it JUnit 3.8 so that the <br/>\nname doesn&#39;t conflict), then add this library as the FIRST required <br/>\nlibrary for your project.<br/>\n2. Modify the existing JUnit library in JBuilder.  You can either change <br/>\nthe library definition (make it pointing to the new library), or <br/>\noverwrite the existing junit.jar and src.jar in JBuilder with version 3.8<br/>\n<br/>\nShane<br/>\n<br/>\ndirkschreckmann wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Thanks for the reply.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I think that in order to do the upgrade, Borland needs to distribute <br/>\n&gt;a new version of their JBuilder TestRunner application.  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I was just curious if perhaps it were simpler.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\">junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Your use of Yahoo!
