Let&#39;s say further<br/>\nthat in order for it to do this correctly for your purposes, you&#39;ve<br/>\ncreated a custom runner and annotated your file using the appropriate<br/>\n@RunWith(MyCustomRunner.class) notation. <br/>\n<br/>\nThen you subclass that file some moderately large number of times, say<br/>\na dozen times at the next level and who-knows-how-many subclass each<br/>\nof those, where each is doing its own various and sundry tests. <br/>\n<br/>\nThen let&#39;s say you run one of those tests directly.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat runner should it use if none is specified in the subclass? The<br/>\ndefault &quot;TestClassRunner&quot; or the parent class&#39;s &quot;MyCustomRunner&quot;? <br/>\n<br/>\nCurrently it uses the default runner rather than its parents&#39; custom<br/>\none. Would it make sense to have runners be inherited from their parents?</div>",
