To the degree that\nthere is redundancy between the code and the tests, it feels like a waste of\ntime, and you&#39;d like to eliminate that waste. \n \nOne of the principles involved in testing is double checking--say something\nin two different ways and if they match, you have a good chance you are\nsaying what you intend to say. The philosophical problem I have with\ngenerating code from tests, or test from code, or tests and code from some\nother notation, is that it ignores double checking. The baby of\ndouble-checking goes out with the bathwater of redundancy.\n \nI like the JUnitFactory tests because they give me an independent\nperspective on my code. Manually inspecting generated tests gives me a\nmeasure of double checking. &quot;Really?!? factorial(100) == 0???&quot; \n \nProgramming language design seemed for many years to be the quest for a\nnotation so clear that programmers couldn&#39;t make mistakes. The\nsmall-but-growing popularity of developer testing seems to me to be evidence\nthat double checking is a more fruitful strategy for achieving reliable\nsoftware.\n \nAll of that said, I agree with the desire for less redundant test notations.\n@Theory, for example, seems to promise more confidence/line of test code.\n \nRegards,\n \nKent Beck\nThree Rivers Institute\n\n  _____  \n\nFrom: junit@yahoogroups.com [mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com] On Behalf Of Ole\nErsoy\nSent: Thursday, February 08, 2007 9:45 PM\nTo: junit@yahoogroups.com\nSubject: Re: [junit] Future of testing tools\n\n\n\nHi Kent,\n\nWe had a pretty good discussion around this \non this thread:\n\nhttp://www.nabble.\n&lt;http://www.nabble.com/100---Method-Testing-and-Generating-Unit-Tests-tf2902\n785.html&gt; com/100---Method-Testing-and-Generating-Unit-Tests-tf2902785.html\n\nI think we could summarize it to having a design tool\nthat helps design the architecture of the system,\nperhaps narrowed by concern area and architectural\nlayer (Presentation, application, business,\nintegration ,data) and then generates tests that\nenumerate all the corner and edge cases, helping the\ndesigner / developer validate the system.\n\nPersonally I would like to see it combined with\nsomething like this:\n\nhttp://www.eclipse.\n&lt;http://www.eclipse.org/articles/Article-EMF-Codegen-with-OCL/article.html&gt;\norg/articles/Article-EMF-Codegen-with-OCL/article.html\n\nSomething that generates both the application code and\nthe corresponding test cases. Then makes it as simple\nas possible for the users / solution recipients to\nvalidate the system. \n\nI&#39;m going to summarize the thread in a little apache\nlicensed eclipse documentation plugin just elaborating\non the enumeration methodology, etc. discussed in the\nthread. I&#39;ll post back when it&#39;s done.\n\nBTW - Thanks a gazillion (To Eric as as well) for\nwriting &quot;Contributing to Eclipse&quot; and JUnit. I think\ncalling it &quot;Briliant work&quot; would be an understatement.\n\nCheers,\n- Ole\n\n--- Kent Beck &lt;kentb@earthlink. &lt;mailto:kentb%40earthlink.net&gt; net&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt; All,\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; At the Agile Open Northwest conference I held an\n&gt; open space session on the\n&gt; future of testing tools. I expected to talk a little\n&gt; about Theories and\n&gt; assertThat, but we ended up having a wide-ranging\n&gt; discussion about a variety\n&gt; of topics. I mind-mapped the result and put in on\n&gt; the conference wiki: \n&gt; \n&gt;\nhttp://www.agileope\n&lt;http://www.agileopennorthwest.com/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?FutureOfUnitTesting&gt;\nnnorthwest.com/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?FutureOfUnitTesting\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; The most surprising result to me was the interest in\n&gt; language features for\n&gt; testing-what would a language look like that\n&gt; included double-checking as a\n&gt; first-class concept? I was also surprised at how\n&gt; much commonality there was\n&gt; between the unit and functional testing &quot;vendors&quot;,\n&gt; that reporting is a big\n&gt; issue for everyone.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; One thing missing from the discussion was much talk\n&gt; about the hopes and\n&gt; dreams of users, so I thought I would open up the\n&gt; question here. What is it\n&gt; you wish your testing tool would do for you that it\n&gt; doesn&#39;t?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Cheers,\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Kent Beck\n&gt; \n&gt; Three Rivers Institute\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been\n&gt; removed]\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n__________________________________________________________\nNow that&#39;s room service!
