Without the possibility of learning new<br/>\nthings from the execution of the tests, I can imagine changing the way<br/>\nI&#39;d apply a test-driven mindset.   (I&#39;ve yet to give or receive an<br/>\ninterview that actually used a computer.)<br/>\n<br/>\n2) For a while, I would give interviews where I&#39;d describe a set of<br/>\nrequirements for a system design, and then ask the candidate to write<br/>\na test for a core component in the system, without implementing it<br/>\nfirst.  I found that only a few absolute superstars could make<br/>\nheadway--interestingly, these were split about 50/50 between those who<br/>\nhad at least tried TDD, and just incredibly intelligent  people able<br/>\nto get their heads around a problem no matter how it was presented.<br/>\n<br/>\n3) On the other hand, I&#39;ve noticed that applicants who end up writing<br/>\nbuggy implementations in interviews often do so because they stop with<br/>\na solution that works on a single example, and have a hard time<br/>\nthinking of ways it could break on other types of input.  I&#39;d like to<br/>\nthink that every professional developer finds ways to get continuously<br/>\nbetter at figuring out what&#39;s wrong with with the code she just wrote:<br/>\nTDD does that for me.<br/>\n<br/>\n   David Saff<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Sat, May 1, 2010 at 8:17 AM, Mike Forsberg &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:bigmike.f@...\">bigmike.f@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; This may be better in a blog post, which I will hopefully get to...<br/>\n&gt; but I&#39;d like to pose two questions to the group first.  Let&#39;s call it<br/>\n&gt; research.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve just completed a set of interviews and looking back on the coding<br/>\n&gt; questions.  I realized that I never followed my test first mantra that<br/>\n&gt; I perform at home.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; First question, to those giving the interview...
