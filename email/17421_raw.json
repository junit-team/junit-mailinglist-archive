This is o=\r\nne of\n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; many examples where test-driven design is sometimes the wro=\r\nng thing to\n&gt; do.\n&gt;\n&gt; Who said that a test has to be welded to only one cla=\r\nss? TDD does not\n&gt; preclude using interfaces.\n\n\nNo, but sayings such as &quot;Do=\r\n the simplest thing that could possibly work&quot; or\n&quot;You aren&#39;t gonna need it&quot;=\r\n imply it...  A bit tangential to TDD, admittedly.\n\nStill, sometimes, I fin=\r\nd that putting the emphasis on testing first can\nsometimes impact the final=\r\n interface of your solution adversely.  In other\nwords:  your code ends up =\r\nbeing more test-friendly than caller-friendly.\n\nA test is more a matter of =\r\na programmer\n&gt; thinking &quot;how do I want to call to receive the desired\n&gt; fun=\r\nctionality?&quot;. The programmer might decide that an interface is\n&gt; exactly wh=\r\nat needs to be used to call the method, and the test would\n&gt; reflect that. =\r\nTo satisfy that test, the programmer would then create a\n&gt; couple of classe=\r\ns, one of which would be the interface that they\n&gt; decided would be part of=\r\n the calling signature. (Remember, TDD is not\n&gt; XP, you don&#39;t have to follo=\r\nw YAGNI.)\n\n\nAgreed,  I conflated both a bit in my previous statement, sorry=\r\n about that.\n\n-- \nC=E9dric\nhttp://testng.org\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this m=\r\nessage have been removed]\n\n\n",
