Is there better way?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>That is exactly correct. Typically, you write ONE test, make it<br/>\ncompile, then make it pass. Then you write the next test, and so on.<br/>\nYou go back and forth between having all tests passing, and having<br/>\n(usually) just the one you are working on fail.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you need to have all tests written in advance, you may have to do<br/>\nsomething a bit more complex. For example, you could provide versions<br/>\nof your test suite, with each version having one more test than the<br/>\none before it. Students would then have to download the tests, one by<br/>\none. That would be horrible to maintain.<br/>\n<br/>\nOr you could provide a printed sheet of the tests (or an electronic<br/>\ncopy) and have them copy one test at a time into their test classes.<br/>\nThat is much easier and not much of an imposition for the students.<br/>\n<br/>\nIdeally, of course, you teach them to write the tests for themselves.<br/>\nThat is really the best way, but you might use one of the other<br/>\napproaches first if they are not ready.</div>",
