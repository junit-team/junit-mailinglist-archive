The application is normally run as a desktop application and\nthe classes within rely on the availability of the window system in order\nto become created and do what they normally do. When I run the JUnit\ntest cases in batch (from cron) I do not have a window system available\nand for that reason some classes cannot be created and tested. Currently\nsome of these tests fail with the\n    [junit] Problem creating javax.swing.plaf.metal.MetalLookAndFeel with method getMenuTextFont and args { : java.lang.reflect.InvocationTargetException\nerror and some of them I have &quot;fixed&quot; to catch that error and not fail.\n\nI like neither of these solutions. I would like to catch the error and\nthrow an &quot;inconclusive&quot;-error to the JUnit framework because conceptually\nthese tests have neither passed, nor found any problem. Is there a way\nto do this? I mean it is important that the inconclusive tests show up in\nthe summary as inconclusive so noone thinks that they passed and it is\nlikewise important that they don&#39;t show up as failed because they have\nnot detected any error.\n\nThe alterative solution would be to just have two set of tests, one that\nare runnable without the window system and one that is not and run them\nboth when a window system is available and just the one of them when it\nis not but this is a lot more complicated since we then risk to forget\nrunning some of the tests some of the times.\n\n        /Linus\n\n",
