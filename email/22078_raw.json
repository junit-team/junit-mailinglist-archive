However, I&#39;m much more interested in experiences than in\n&gt;&gt; votes. If someone said, &quot;I went through my code and I could\n&gt;&gt; definitely use classes as categories because of X, Y and/or Z,&quot; would\n&gt;&gt; be compelling to me. Even more compelling is if someone would write\n&gt;&gt; the test cases for the new scheme.\n&gt;\n&gt; Just skimmed through two of my OS projects. 80% of the test cases refer to a single class under test. For about 20% of those CUTs I have more than one test class; those could benefit most since the naming convention doesn&#39;t help to show the connection.\n&gt;\n&gt; The follow-up question is: What would I do with this meta info?\n\nSome (many) people have asked for categories as a way of running only\nsome of their tests, and our primary goal is to help them.  If you\nwere ever tempted to run only the subset of your tests that shared\nsome given CUT, this annotation strategy would let you do that.  Does\nthat make your life better?\n\n   David Saff\n\n",
