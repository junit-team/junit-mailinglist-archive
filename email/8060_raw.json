Except that I&#39;m able to do this:\n&gt; \n&gt; 1. Instantiate an object.\n&gt; 2. Initialize the object with known values.\n&gt; 3. Serialize the object.\n&gt; 4. Load object into another variable.\n&gt; 5. assertEquals on 2 objects.\n\nYes.  That&#39;s what I thought.\n\n&gt; I have implemented equals methods on my classes so if they are not \n&gt; equal (not the same, but equal). In fact, I do some tests on my \n&gt; equals functions by taking 2 objects that should be equal, and also \n&gt; comparing 2 objects that are not. I also verify that they are not \n&gt; the same objects (i.e. obj1 == obj2)\n\nHave a look at the Gargoyle extensions that Mike Bowler has written: \n\nhttp://gsbase.sourceforge.net/\n\nPart of it is EqualsTester which does a comprehensive verification of\na class&#39;s equals() and hashCode() methods.  It saves alot of test code.\n\n&gt; &gt; I advise a separate test for each (&quot;advise&quot; because you don&#39;t work \n&gt; &gt; for me.. if you did, I&#39;d &quot;insist&quot;).  \n&gt; \n&gt; And that&#39;s why I&#39;m here. Trying to learn. \n\n:)\n\n&gt; In fact, I just got hired by this company and they don&#39;t do ANY \n&gt; testing... I&#39;m trying to move them forward in this, so I appreciate \n&gt; the tips.\n\nAre they interested in improving that?  \n\n&lt;This message contains commercial content, reader disgression is advised&gt;\n\nMaybe some training is in order?   see www.adaptionsoft.com (we are\none of several compainies that could help with this)\n\nI&#39;ll be teaching TDD tutorials at various conferences this year (see \nhttp://www.adaptionsoft.com/conferences.htm\n\nAlso, watch for my book in July: http://www.adaptionsoft.com/tddapg.htm\n\n&lt;/commercial content&gt;\n\n&gt; I&#39;ll look into Mocks. I&#39;ve read a little about them, but I&#39;m trying \n&gt; to take baby steps...\n\nThey can take a bit of effort to grok... but they are a very powerful\ntesting tool.  I suggest EasyMock (www.easymock.org) as well as\nMockObjects (http://www.mockobjects.com)\n\n&gt; My main concern is that the functionality involved serializing to a \n&gt; file, so I thought I&#39;d need to exercise that in a test (i.e., saving \n&gt; to a known location, then making sure it loads from the same known \n&gt; location, etc).\n\n1) I&#39;d consider that more of an integration level test (which needs to\nbe done, but not as part of TDD)\n2) when TDDing you should try to avoid using external resources as\nmuch as possible\n3) use createTempFile.. see\nhttp://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.1/docs/api/java/io/File.html#createTempFile(java.lang.String,%20java.lang.String)\n\n&gt; The output is binary, and I&#39;m working with streams all the way until \n&gt; I actually write the file.\n\nA mock file or mock stream could be programmed to expect a specific\nsequence of bytes.\n\n&gt; Thanks again for your tips\n\nMy pleasure\n\nDave\n\n\n",
