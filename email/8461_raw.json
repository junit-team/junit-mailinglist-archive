If you really want to know the answer, look at\nthe source or=\r\n trace through test execution with a debugger. There&#39;s not\nvery much code t=\r\nhere so it wouldn&#39;t take more than 30 minutes to have\nintimate knowledge of=\r\n the whole thing.\n\n&gt; It seems that if a value is returned from a \n&gt; testXXX=\r\nXX method, it is not included. \n\nYes.\n\n&gt; Is there a hard reason why? (ie wo=\r\nuld it break junit to allow test \n&gt; methods which return values \n\nOne reaso=\r\nn not to do that is that supporting (utility, etc.) methods\nmight be interp=\r\nreted as test methods. You&#39;d have to make sure they never\nstart with &#39;test&#39;=\r\n.\n\n&gt; or is it just a convention to make the \n&gt; introspection easier?)\n\nProb=\r\nably. The originators might have thought of some other reason as\nwell.\n\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; I would like to write test methods that I can reuse outside of junit, \n&gt; =\r\nwhere I would want to inspect the result of the test. Right now I&#39;m \n&gt; face=\r\nd with writing the methods twice.\n\nWrite those methods as you&#39;d like to and=\r\n then just &#39;publish&#39; them for\nJUnit&#39;s consumption with JUnit style test met=\r\nhods that just wrapper/call\nthem.\n\n-----------------------------\nMike Silve=\r\nrstein\nSilverMark, Inc.\nThe Object Testing Company\nwww.javatesting.com\n****=\r\n******************************\n* Providers of &quot;Test Mentor&quot;     *\n* and &quot;En=\r\nhanced JUnit&quot; Java      *\n* component testing tools        *\n**************=\r\n********************\n\n---\nOutgoing mail is certified Virus Free.\nChecked by=\r\n AVG anti-virus system (http://www.grisoft.com).\nVersion: 6.0.489 / Virus D=\r\natabase: 288 - Release Date: 6/10/2003\n \n\n\n",
