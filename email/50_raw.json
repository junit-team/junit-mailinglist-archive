I have seen this handled both ways where the\n&gt; RemoteException are caught and where they are thrown to the client\n&gt; (regardless of local or distributed).\n\nIn reality, I never *throw* a RemoteException myself in the MyEJBImpl. The\nRemoteExceptions are thrown by the container. If something goes wrong in\n*my* code, I normally throw a MyEJBException.\nSo, if I run myEJBImpl locally, we will never really get a remote exception.\nIf we run remote, the container will take care that a remote exception is\nthrown if something goes wrong in the container.\n\nAlthough RemoteExceptions are never really thrown, the clients still have to\ncatch them, that&#39;s true. But I don&#39;t care about that, because I want to\nreuse my clients for the local and the remote EJBs. The client simply uses\nthe theMyEJBCreator. The theMyEJBCreator decides wether a local or remote\nEJB is created. In my case, it looks in a properties file.\n\nI don&#39;t have to change 1 line of code to run the tests on local or on remote\nEJBs.\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt; b) Would it be possible to use the EJB&#39;s Remote Interface as your &lt;&lt;\n&gt; MyEJBIF &gt;&gt;?\n\nWell, we chose not too, because now our clients are independent of the\nEJBObject interface. The only thing they need to know about EJBs are these\nexceptions. The clients don&#39;t import any other EJB stuff.\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt; What is the difference between &lt;&lt; MyEJBIF &gt;&gt; and the EJB&#39;s Remote\n&gt; Interface?\n\n\nOnly difference is the extension of EJBObject.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; The first time I approached this problem I made a special business\n&gt; interface for my objects and then realized I could just use the EJB\n&gt; Remote interface itself.  The only draw back is my client must catch\n&gt; Remote, Create, Finder EJB Exceptions (even though they may not be\n&gt; thrown) in the local case.\n&gt;\n&gt; PS I like you choice of names i.e. biPolar...  I have an Electrical\n&gt; Engineering background and it brings back memories of Bipolar Junction\n&gt; Transistors (BJT&#39;s).  I understood exactly what you meant.\n\n\nComes from a JavaReport some time ago. Ronald Mak described Bipolar Corba\nObjects in Java. We figured it was exactly the same thing we were doing (and\nrenamed them).\n\n\nbye,\nvp\n\n\n",
