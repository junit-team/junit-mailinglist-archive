This is nice, but I would like to see a couple of things.\n\n1. I would like a checkbox which means add all those testmethods but\ncommented out initially. This would save my usual next action which is\nto go through manually commenting them out - in some classes, this is\na lot of work.\n\n2. I would like to see a checkbox and textfield which would allow me\nto append a suffix to each testmethod. At my present stage of using\nJUnit, I find I start out with the test method given me by JUnit\nautomagically,  then I populate the body with my test, then I\ncopy/paste the testmethod, add 001 to the end of the first of them,\n002 to the end of the second one, and go on to edit the body of the\nsecond of these testmethods.\n\n(I know I said a couple, but pretty please..?)\n\n3. It would be great if while viewing an existing testcase file, I\ncould bring up some JUnit wizard that lets me add more testmethod(s)\nfrom the base or, I guess, even some other, class.\n\nNow maybe others will explain how these are already doable :-)\n\nThanks for reading this far.\n\n\n\n",
