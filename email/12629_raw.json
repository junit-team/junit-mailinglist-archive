For example, if Agile or Test Driven \napproach is followed, the approach of testing is already defined. RUP \nand CMMI also have defined their way of testing.\n\nSo this has to be discussed rogether with the development team.\n\nJirong\n\n\n--- In junit@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Maly, Daniel&quot; &lt;daniel.maly@c...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; Hi,\n&gt; \n&gt; This may not be the best user group for my post, but I believe the \nunit\n&gt; testing experts will have an answer:\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m looking for a formal testing methodology/process to accompany \nand\n&gt; precede our unit testing harness - on the development side of SDLC. \nAn\n&gt; approach that unifies requirements testing, software design testing \nand\n&gt; implementation testing.\n&gt; \n&gt; Any information is very appreciated.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thank You,\n&gt; Best Regards,\n&gt; \n&gt; Daniel\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
