In this way\nyou can test servlets and relevant classes &quot;outside&quot; a webserver. I&#39;ve\nfound this approach much more feasible than to deploy the servlet and test\nby making actual HttpRequests from test-classes within Junit to the\nwebserver. As well as it will give you a nice in depth knowledge on how the\nwhole servlet framework ;-)\n\n\n/e\n\n\n\n                                                                                                                                       \n                      Satinder Singh                                                                                                   \n                      &lt;satinderynr@yaho        To:       junit@yahoogroups.com                                                         \n                      o.com&gt;                   cc:                                                                                     \n                                               Subject:  [junit] Doubt in Httpservletrequest and Httpservletresponse                   \n                      28/05/2003 01:21                                                                                                 \n                      PM                                                                                                               \n                      Please respond to                                                                                                \n                      junit                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                                                       \n                                                                                                                                       \n\n\n\n\nHi Everybody,\nAs I am new to Junit I have created some small examples to test on junit\nbut now when I am trying to test a method of servlet having a parameters\nlike HttpServletRequest and HttpServletResponse here I am stuck.\nWould anyone please tell me how to test a method with this type of complex\nparameters.\nThanx\nSatinder.\n\n\n---------------------------------\nDo you Yahoo!?\nFree online calendar with sync to Outlook(TM).\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\n\nTo unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\njunit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n\n\nYour use of Yahoo!
