We want to use JUnit as <br/>\ntools for performing unit testing. However, I found difficulties that <br/>\ntest the correctness of JFrame (with other GUI components). Does it <br/>\npossible that test by using JUnit, say, the JLabel is appear correct <br/>\ncaption after some changes. But at the same moment, how can I tigger <br/>\nthe changes in JUnit?<br/>\n  Would you mind teaching me any tips to tackle this problems? Or <br/>\ndoes it has any articles/guide to the implementation of this kind of <br/>\ntesting??<br/>\n<br/>\n  Best regards and thanks a lot for kind attention.<br/>\n<br/>\nMonster~</div>",
