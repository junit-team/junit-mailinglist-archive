I wonder if not many <br/>\n&gt; people find this useful or if I&#39;m overstating how<br/>\n&gt; useful it can be.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>In the past I tried to make this same distinction, but<br/>\nI found in practice that it was often arbitrary.<br/>\nOften, I&#39;ll change code that invalidates existing test<br/>\ncases so they start throwing assertions. The code<br/>\nisn&#39;t broken, the problem is that the test cases are<br/>\nout of sync with the code since the assumptions have<br/>\nchanged. To me, it doesn&#39;t really matter what&#39;s broken<br/>\n(testing code or tested code) or how I&#39;m notified of<br/>\nthe problem (assertion or error). The point is that I<br/>\nneed to investigate the problem and fix it.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor me, the path of least resistance is the most<br/>\neffective: make my test cases simple to write and<br/>\nsimple to understand. Thus, I prefer letting JUnit<br/>\nhandle uncaught exceptions as errors since this:<br/>\n<br/>\n  public void testFoo() throws Exception {<br/>\n    code;<br/>\n  }<br/>\n<br/>\nis simpler than:<br/>\n<br/>\n  public void testFoo() {<br/>\n    try {<br/>\n      code;<br/>\n    catch (ErrorException e) {<br/>\n      fail(...);<br/>\n    }<br/>\n  }<br/>\n<br/>\nBoth versions say the same thing to me: I expect<br/>\n&quot;code&quot; to work, and if it doesn&#39;t something is wrong.<br/>\nI just find the latter case less clear.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy two cents...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nMake international calls for as low as $.04/minute with Yahoo!
