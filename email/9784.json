Although the 8 Queens problem isn&#39;t really much about programming, and<br/>\nis a lot about conceptualizing. I think it&#39;s a good exercise, but perhaps<br/>\nnot the best for &quot;proving&quot; whether TDD works.<br/>\n<br/>\nRon Jeffries<br/>\nwww.XProgramming.com<br/>\nThe greatest mistake we make is living in constant fear that we will make one.<br/>\n  --  John Maxwell</div>",
