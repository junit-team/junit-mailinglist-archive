So, one test left residual that makes the next test have failures.<br/>\n<br/>\n-------------- Original message -------------- <br/>\nHi,<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve got a weird situation and can&#39;t figure out how to debug it. <br/>\nPerhaps someone has some advice?<br/>\n<br/>\nI have a class called HouseholdTest.  If I run this test by itself,<br/>\nit&#39;s ok.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also have a class suite called AgentsTestSuite which contains the<br/>\nHouseholdTest.  If I run this test, I get errors on one or two of the<br/>\nmethods; i.e rerunning the test over and over again sometimes gives<br/>\none error and sometimes two (always on the same methods).  If I use<br/>\nRerun failed tests - Failures first, the test is ok in all<br/>\ncircumstances.<br/>\n<br/>\nAgentsTestSuite is inside another suite called ModelTest.  Running<br/>\nthis throws up errors on the same methods as above, plus another in a<br/>\ndifferent test suite (which again is ok by itself). Rerunning failed<br/>\ntests first clears one of the methods in the HouseholdTest but that&#39;s<br/>\nit.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat is going on here?  I&#39;ve spent quite a while debugging it but<br/>\ncan&#39;t seem to figure out where the snag is.  Has anyone else<br/>\nencountered something like this?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\nJames<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYahoo!
