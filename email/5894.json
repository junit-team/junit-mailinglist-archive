After <br/>\n&gt; &gt;searching thru documentation, this news group and other sources, <br/>\n </span></blockquote>some <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;issues still remain that I hope some of you can help answer.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;    1. We have a need to put some trace messages in the tests so <br/>\n </span></blockquote>as <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;to know the progress of the test itself because each test can be <br/>\n&gt; &gt;fairly timeconsuming. Is there a way to have these capture this <br/>\n&gt; &gt;output for an individual test in the GUI-based TestRunner? I see <br/>\n </span></blockquote>only <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;thing that is captured for each test on the UI are the assertion <br/>\n&gt; &gt;failures. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; My guess is that if TestListener doesn&#39;t have something to allow <br/>\n </span></blockquote>you to<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; log progress messages, then you can easily add something to it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I like your suggestion of adding to the TestListener. I am interested <br/>\nin implementing this. But for this would I have to touch the JUnit <br/>\nTestRunner source or do you think I can do it externally?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;    2. I see that JUnitReport is used quite extensively with Ant. <br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;From what I learnt reading, it helps output TestResult in XML <br/>\n </span></blockquote>format <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;and then one can translate it using XSLT. Know how one can use <br/>\n </span></blockquote>that <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;without having to use Ant? Any resources on Net would be helpful.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Hm. Your best bet is to look at the source of the JUnitReport task <br/>\n </span></blockquote>and<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; you should be able to tell, from that, how to use it outside Ant.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Ok! I will go and find the source for JUnitReport task and have a <br/>\nlook at it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;   3. I see JUnit is great for nesting sub-suites within a suite <br/>\n </span></blockquote>and <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;thereby creating a tree of suites. But when it comes to test <br/>\n </span></blockquote>results, <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;is there a way to get a breakup of which sub-suite had how many <br/>\n&gt; &gt;failures from TestResult?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; If you want to map a TestSuite object to the collection of<br/>\n&gt; Failures/Errors generated by its tests, then your best bet is <br/>\n </span></blockquote>likely to<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; register an extra TestListener, which you can do by changing the<br/>\n&gt; TestRunner you usually use.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I have not played with the TestListener. So I will need to try it out.<br/>\nBut this suggestion would require TestRunner to be modified?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for your time,<br/>\nVern</div>",
