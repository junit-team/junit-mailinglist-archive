The new<br/>\nsession beans are just pojos with dependency injection and the EJB<br/>\nstuff is merely visible as anotations.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I guess I&#39;m saying I don&#39;t feel that there is as much benefit of<br/>\nextracting the business-logic of the session beans as pojos anymore<br/>\nsince the session-beans are in effect pojos already (with<br/>\nannotations). And can be tested with regular unit tests as they are,<br/>\nso why complicate things?<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course it&#39;s possible that there are issues I have yet to run in to<br/>\nand that I&#39;m viewing this from the sunny side but so far so good.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I would like to do though (I develop in geronimo) is to be able<br/>\nto start up open-ejb inside some acceptance-tests. It looked like it<br/>\ncould be done from open-ejbs site but I have not gotten around to that<br/>\nyet. I still need to deploy to a server sometimes so maybe the added<br/>\nbenefit of in-test containers are marginal or negative.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m also interested in any issues people may have had with testing EJB<br/>\n3.0 stuff, it would be nice to know what to watch out for before I&#39;m<br/>\nin the middle of it :)<br/>\n<br/>\nJust my 2 cents...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Jan 23, 2008 9:25 PM, Nat Pryce &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:nat.pryce@...\">nat.pryce@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; On 23/01/2008, Kent Larsson &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kent.larsson@...\">kent.larsson@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;  |&gt; One approach I&#39;ve heard is to have the session beans as dumb forwarders<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; of requests to normal objects. And implement the actual business logic<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; in normal Java classes.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  This is how I do it and it works very well. It enforces a clear<br/>\n&gt;  separation between application logic, which is written as normal<br/>\n&gt;  object-oriented code, and the J2EE technology. That keeps all the<br/>\n&gt;  awkward design issues of the J2EE framework well outside the<br/>\n&gt;  application. The classes that refer to the J2EE framework are just an<br/>\n&gt;  adapter layer between the transaction management of the app container<br/>\n&gt;  and the objects of the application itself.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  It means that you can easily test the application code in plain JUnit<br/>\n&gt;  (and jMock).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  You&#39;ll need end-to-end tests to ensure that the adapter layer works as<br/>\n&gt;  expected. But you have those already, I expect.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  --Nat<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n-----------------------------------------------------<br/>\nJoakim Ohlrogge<br/>\nAgical AB<br/>\nVästerlånggatan 79, 2 tr<br/>\n111 29 Stockholm, SWEDEN<br/>\n<br/>\nMobile: +46-708-754004<br/>\nBlog: johlrogge.wordpress.com<br/>\nE-mail: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:joakim.ohlrogge@...\">joakim.ohlrogge@...</a> </span></blockquote></div>",
