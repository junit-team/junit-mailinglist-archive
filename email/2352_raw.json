B. Rainsberger&quot; &lt;jbrains762@...&gt;\r\n\r\n&gt;Hello,\n\nWelcome!\n\n&gt;I have a class which is responsible for deciding which email template to \n&gt;use\n&gt;based on some complex business rules. The selected template is never stored\n&gt;in the class itself (this is a singleton object). Instead, it&#39;s passed to\n&gt;another method in another class which populates the template with dynamic\n&gt;data and sends the email out.\n\nYou may need to be more concrete about your design. Class names might help.\n\nStill, your EMailTemplateDecider must have a method -- maybe it&#39;s private -- \nlike &quot;selectTemplate&quot; or &quot;selectTemplateDescriptor&quot;. In other words, it must \nhave a way of mapping -- however complex the map may be -- some input to a \ntemplate or template descriptor or template ID. Simply make assertions on \nthe correctness of that mapping.\n\nEMailTemplateDecider emtd = new EMailTemplateDecider();\nassertEquals(&quot;templateA&quot;, emtd.selectTemplate(someInput));\n...\n\nPerhaps that method should be public and your &quot;decider&quot; is doing too many \nthings.\n\nBTW: Do you really need a singleton? Give this article a quick read to be \nsure.\n\nhttp://www-106.ibm.com/developerworks/components/library/co-single.html\n\nJBR.\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nGet your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com/intl.asp\n\n\n",
