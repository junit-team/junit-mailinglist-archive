For example all files that have a &quot;Test&quot; in their names.<br/>\n&gt; - a TestCase is only executed if it has at least one &quot;test...&quot; method (otherwise a warning is raised)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The TestCollector doesn&#39;t parse the file to see if it has a &quot;test&quot; method.  At least no TestCollector found in the official release.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; To summarize:<br/>\n&gt; - your TestCase must implement at least one method beginning with &quot;test&quot;<br/>\n&gt; - in order to use the standard TestCollector (but you can write your own) your TestCase must contain &quot;Test&quot; in its name<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Now we have deviated from the original topic.  I have a _TestSuite_ that is not<br/>\nbeing executed as a test suite.  It is included with a number of other tests,<br/>\ngathered by Ant&#39;s junit task.  Currently, I am trying to run it through the<br/>\njunit.swingui.TestRunner class--but it also is treating my TestSUITE as a TestCase.<br/>\nThat is not cool.  If I take the time to write a TestSuite, I want it to be run<br/>\nas a suite--not a case.</div>",
