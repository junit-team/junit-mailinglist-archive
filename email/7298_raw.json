I can see from the FAQ \nhttp://junit.sourceforge.net/doc/faq/faq.htm#organize_3 that there is \na way to write code such that setUp or tearDown methods are called \nonly once, but that this is not encouraged.\n\nMy situation is that I was just adding logging support to my classes, \nand that the classes are set up so that each time a class is created \nit is handed a unique id.  As a consequence if I have 7 test methods \nin my class, the logging system gets initialized 7 times (since the \ninit() method is in setUp) and 7 objects with 7 different object ids \nget created, one for each test method.\n\nI can see that conceivably there might be interactions such that the \nmultiple re-initializations help make the tests more robust, but I&#39;m \nnot sure quite what they are.\n\nSo my question is, does initialization of a logging system count as \nsomething that deserves a unique setUp method?\n\nAnd if I want to conduct a series of tests on one object with a \nparticular id, should I try and create the object in a unique setUp \nmethod, or should I create single test methods that test a series of \noperations on a particular object?\n\nI am guessing that really I should have multiple test methods, to \ntest each operation and then other tests to test series of combined \noperations.  I am then concerned about whether these more complex \ntests should be in the same test class or in a different one.  \nPerhaps unit testing should only ever test a single method at a time, \nand the desire to test a series of them at once suggests there should \nbe another method, or object that can encapsulate the complex \noperation, and then this can be tested in another class?\n\nThanks in advance.\n\nCHEERS&gt; SAM\n\n\n\n\n",
