I have found  \nthrough years of practice that end-to-end tests are ineffective at  \nfinding integration defects caused by incorrect understanding of the  \ncontract between pairs of objects. I use a design technique based on  \ncollaboration tests and contract tests that drive out integration  \ndefects without integration tests, but it took me a few years of TDD  \npractice before I felt comfortable with the technique. It&#39;s not for  \nbeginners.\n&gt; 2) I was thinking TDD is only used to develop functionality by writing\n&gt; unit tests first and then the code, can it be more generic to apply\n&gt; for functional testing ?\n&gt;\nI tried doing TDD starting with end-to-end tests, and I found that it  \nencouraged me to try to write exhaustive end-to-end tests, and that&#39;s  \nwhere the big problem lies. In order to test a system exhaustively  \nwith end-to-end tests, you typically need a huge number of tests.  \nThousands to millions. I can get the same confidence from hundreds to  \nthousands of object tests. As a result, I use end-to-end tests as a  \nway to protect against obvious, wide-spread problems, rather than as a  \nway to check a system carefully for defects. I certainly don&#39;t use  \nthem as a starting point for TDD.\n&gt; 3) I need to understand more on this &#39;end-to-end&#39; testing, are there\n&gt; any tools available ? or I should rely on the build process for\n&gt; executing all the test cases for me?\n&gt;\nAn end-to-end test is simply a test that runs the entire system from  \nend to end. There&#39;s no need for specific tools, although there is  \ngenerally a wider selection of appropriate tools for end-to-end  \ntesting compared to more focused object testing.\n\nAs for the build executing all the tests, I prefer it, but once again,  \nif we have too many end-to-end tests, then we become tempted to have  \ntwo different builds: a continuous build that doesn&#39;t run the end-to- \nend tests (because they&#39;re too slow) and a nightly build that does run  \nthem (because it takes hours to run them). This slows down feedback  \nwhile giving us the illusion of continuous feedback, and I find it too  \neasy to make serious mistakes that way. This is another reason I  \nlooked for ways to avoid integration defects without end-to-end tests.\n&gt; Actually, I&#39;ve been started using unit-testing tools like Junit\n&gt; recently for the newly added API in our product but rest of the code\n&gt; is pretty much legacy in nature. So, i was wondering are there any\n&gt; tools for doing this end-to-end testing ? just like Junit ?\n&gt;\nIf you have a Java interface for your application, you can use Java- \nbased tools like JUnit. For web applications, you could use HtmlUnit  \nor HttpUnit among others. I&#39;m no longer an expert on available tools,  \nso I&#39;ll let others answer this question better than I could.\n\nTake care.\n----\nJ. B.
