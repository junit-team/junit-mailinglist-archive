But the project doesn&#39;t seem to be as active as the JUnit \ncommunity :-) and that&#39;s why I asked all of you about the possibilities in \nJunit\n\nBest regards,\n\nJ.

But I have a question which I hope some of \nyou\n&gt; &gt; can help me with - it&#39;s regarding testing private/protected methods and \nhow\n&gt; &gt; to organize my test package.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; First the package. I have read to articles regarding test (&quot;Junit best\n&gt; &gt; practices&quot; from JavaWorld and &quot;Incremental development with Ant and JUnit&quot;\n&gt; &gt; from developerWorks). In the JBT article Andy Schneider advice you to keep\n&gt; &gt; tests in the same location as the source code. And in the Incremental...\n&gt; &gt; article Malcolm Davis advice you to make a separate package. Which \napproach\n&gt; &gt; is the best to use?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; it is better to make separate package. when we can identify as two separate\n&gt; components like source code and test code it is better to keep them as two\n&gt; different components from configuration management point of view.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I must admit that I like the idea of making a separate package but then\n&gt; &gt; again - how do I then test private and protected methods? And if I keep \nthe\n&gt; &gt; tests in the same location as the source code - who do I then test private\n&gt; &gt; methods?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; we cant test private and protected methods directly.\n&gt; we need to find the public methods, which are using those protected and \nprivate\n&gt; methods and test that public methods is enough. Still it is not sufficient.\n&gt; \n&gt; one thing the developer can do is, he can change the private and protected \nto\n&gt; public and test them. after that he can change back to private and protected\n&gt; respectively. but this is not that much good idea.\n&gt; \n&gt; still we need to find the exact way.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I would very much appreciate if some of you could give me a little example\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Kind regards,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; J.
