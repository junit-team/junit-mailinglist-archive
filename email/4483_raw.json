JUnit won&#39;t do that.\n\nIs that all J2ME Unit does? test code with the KVM? \n\nBecause if it is, your statement makes me very curious about \nsomething. We use Ant for compiling and testing etc whenever \npossible. Ant has a JUnit optional-task \n(http://jakarta.apache.org/ant/manual/index.html) and within that \ntask there is a choice of what JVM can be used. It defaults \nwith &#39;java&#39;; however, it can easily be changed to &#39;kvm&#39; (if the &#39;kvm&#39; \nstandalone VM is installed on your machine-- which it is on mine).\n\nSo... it seems that there is really no need for J2ME Unit if one can \ntest using JUnit and the KVM. \n\nDo you think that will work?\n\ndq\n\n\n",
