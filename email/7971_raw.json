Be sure that you break it in\n&gt; a\n&gt; &gt;way that you expect.  Does that make sense?\n&gt; \n&gt; No, because it isn&#39;t true.\n\nYou&#39;re right, I left out the &#39;adding an aspect&#39; bit, and was assuming\nwe were talking about superclasses that attempt to compare themselves\nto subclasses.  Sorry about that.\n\n-Kevin\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nThe New Yahoo! Search - Faster. Easier. Bingo.\nhttp://search.yahoo.com\n\n\n",
