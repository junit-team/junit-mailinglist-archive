But it has advantages.<br/>\n<br/>\nConsecutive tests which depend on failed tests, are not executed, which speeds up the tests. It also increases the information value. People are not confused with dozens or even hundreds of failed tests when just one or two tests really failed on which most other tests depend. I know of situations where there are dozenzs of failed tests (or more) reported by CruiseControl, and noone looks into them until one week before release date. This happens. It makes developers afraid to look into the apparent mess. If there would be just one or two failed tests, they would look into it more likely, and sooner.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe heuristic strategy would not really solve the problem. since it is not equivalent to the dependency specification. It would still run all tests, but the likelyhood that the first run tests are the cause for all the errors would not be very high I think, whereas you could trust the dependencies very much if they are set correctly.<br/>\n<br/>\nDependencies are a frequent topic. We have it in OSGI, in issue tracking software, in project management software, in requirement specifications and in test specifications. Why not support it in JUnit tests too?<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, this is just some quick thoughts about it. This issue alone will certainly not draw people to other test frameworks, but it would improve JUnit I think. Noone would be forced to use that feature, but I think it would be good, if one could use it with JUnit, even in an coarse way (for example if the dependency &quot;testApplicationServerRuns&quot; passed).<br/>\n<br/>\nBye,<br/>\n<br/>\nHans<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- On Thu, 7/17/08, Kent Beck &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kentb@...\">kentb@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\nFrom: Kent Beck &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kentb@...\">kentb@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nSubject: RE: [junit] Does JUnit 4 now support dependencies?<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nDate: Thursday, July 17, 2008, 9:28 AM<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n    <br/>\n            Hans,<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI agree that test dependencies are a good idea.
