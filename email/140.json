The problem appears when I try to cast a particular object as another Class. This casting goes through fine with the textui flavour, but gives a problem if I use any other flavour TestRunner. It appears that there are 2 class loaders at work here and hence the problem. If no one has come across this earlier or no one knows a possible resolution I might have to go through the TestRunner code - something which I don&#39;t want to do :-)<br>\n <br>\nthanks,<br>\nRama<br>\n</blockquote><br>\nA non-loading graphical test runner is available -- in JUnit 3.2 and earlier, junit.swingui.NonLoadingTestRunner will not reload classes. &nbsp;Does that runner show the problem?<br>\n<br>\nIt seems to me that I&#39;ve seen this before, and that the problem had to do, as you say, with hanging on to a reference to a class from one classloader and trying to cast to or from a class from another, although I can&#39;t remember quite how. &nbsp;It is true, I think, that even if ClassA extends ClassB, ClassA from classloader 1 is incompatible with ClassB from classloader 2.<br>\n<br>\n---<br>\nBen Schroeder<br>\nschroeder@...<br>\n \n</span></blockquote></html>\n\n</div>",
