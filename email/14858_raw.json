I kept reading &quot;CLDC&quot; whenever you wrote &quot;CDC&quot;. Reflection\n&gt; is definitely an option then.\n\nOK, good :)\n\n&gt; I still think that there is little point in testing on the device\n&gt; itself. Or rather, that it makes little sense as long as you don&#39;t have\na &gt; set of tests on the emulator.\n\nUhm... not sure I follow. I presume testing on the device itself would be\nbetter than no testing at all, e.g. in the event that you don&#39;t have a\ngood enough emulator, or emulator tests.\n\nAnyway, if you are insterested in knowing whether or not your application\nwill run (&quot;correctly&quot;) on &quot;some&quot; J2ME device, it would also be better than\nnothing to run your tests in a J2ME JVM on a regular desktop machine or\nsomething like that, running for example linux or Windows (if the virtual\nmachine supports one of those platforms). This might be a good alternative\nif you are not able to get hold of a suitable, full-featured emulator.\nRight?\n\n-- \nJohn\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\n__________________________________ \nYahoo!
