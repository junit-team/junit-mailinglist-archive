More to the point it is not economically viable<br/>\n&gt;to write and maintain the recovery code.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I agree that you have to be practical about the cost of recovery. <br/>\n Sometimes handling an exception in context is more economical than <br/>\nexiting gracefully.  When&#39;s the last time your application server <br/>\ncrashed because your servlet raised an exception?  <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;If an exception is caused by a<br/>\n&gt;software error I just want the stacktrace to be logged. Forcing <br/>\n&gt;developers to write catch clauses for checked exceptions increases <br/>\n&gt;the possiblity they will lose that original stacktrace.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>In my experience, users don&#39;t understand stack traces.  I generally log <br/>\nstack traces to a file, but print something the user understands to the <br/>\nconsole.  That requires the use of a catch clause.    <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;Have you not been in the position of debugging a stacktrace to find<br/>\n&gt;that it was just a rethrow of another exception which has now been<br/>\n&gt;lost?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;ll take that as a non-rhetorical question.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have been in that unfortunate situation.  It&#39;s certainly no fun. <br/>\n However, that pain isn&#39;t born solely out of handling exceptions in a <br/>\ncatch clause.   <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;My preference would be to use unchecked exceptions everywhere and<br/>\n&gt;maybe use checked exceptions (refactor from unchecked to checked)<br/>\n&gt;where I will explicitely try to do some recovery.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Fair enough.  Do what works for you.<br/>\n<br/>\nMike</div>",
