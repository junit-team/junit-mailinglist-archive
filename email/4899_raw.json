Especi=\r\nally when the objects and interfaces \n&gt; &gt; &gt; are in the midst of evolving.\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; \n&gt; &gt; They can be made solid enough.  I myself also do iterative \n&gt; &gt; dev=\r\nelopment.  I work toward the usage of the component \n&gt; before I focus \n&gt; &gt; =\r\non 100% functionality.\n&gt;  \n&gt; [...]\n&gt;  \n&gt; &gt; interface Store\n&gt; &gt; {\n&gt; &gt;     vo=\r\nid store(String key, Object val);\n&gt; &gt;     Object retrieve(String key);\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n    void remove(String key);\n&gt; &gt; }\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; That interface is enough to kno=\r\nw how to use the object store.\n&gt; \n&gt; So what are your &quot;solid enough&quot; contrac=\r\nts? How do you find \n&gt; those contracts by looking at nothing but an interfa=\r\nce definition?\n\n\nI start there.  However, there are some questions that nee=\r\nd to be\nanswered when looking at this specific interface.\n\nWhat happens if =\r\nI store an object with a key value that already\nexists?  Is there an except=\r\nion to be thrown, or does it silently\noverwrite the value there.\n\nThe inter=\r\nface above suggests that the object is silently overwritten.\nI would likely=\r\n change the contract of the interface to introduce the\nexception.  I would =\r\nalso add javadocs to describe that contract in plain\nenglish.\n\nNext questio=\r\nn is does the retrieve() method remove the object from the\nstore?  The exis=\r\ntense of the the remove() method suggests that they\nhappen\nseparately.  The=\r\nrefore I add javadocs to clearly state that the\nretrieve()\nmethod does not =\r\nremove the object from the store.\n\nLastly, we find that a useful method bot=\r\nh for testing and dynamic key\nselection would suggest  that we need a new m=\r\nethod to see if a key is\nalready used.  I would likely add that in.\n\nYou al=\r\nways have to have somewhere to start.  Usually when you design\nsuch a compo=\r\nnent, you already have a usecase in mind.  You test for that\nusecase, and m=\r\nake sure that the contracts of that usecase are clearly\nstated in the inter=\r\nface.\n\n\n",
