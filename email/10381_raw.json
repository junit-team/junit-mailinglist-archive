Instead, she performed specificacion checking using \ntheorem provers and =\r\nother advanced tools. This has made me think \nabout the utility of unit tes=\r\nting and the level of code reliability \nthat unit testing can provide.\n\nWha=\r\nt do you have to say about this? Could it have an impact on unit \ntesting a=\r\nnd, specifically, on JUnit?\n\nLook forward to hearing from you.\n\nRoberto Ju=\r\n=E1rez Maldonado\nJava Analyst Programmer.\nMobile Networks.\nOmnilogic Teleco=\r\nmunicaciones.\nC&#92;Ram=EDrez de Arellano 15.\nMadrid\nSpain.\n\n\n\n",
