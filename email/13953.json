Too much gets marked as public that really shouldn&#39;t be.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Only if you think that public=published. Otherwise it&#39;s just fine to use it<br/>\na lot.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Internal APIs need to be distinguished from published APIs, and Java<br/>\n&gt; doesn&#39;t let you do that across package boundaries. As I said, this may<br/>\n&gt; get better in the 1.6/1.7 time frame.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>In fact I think the problem is even more complex. You might even want to<br/>\npublish different things to different clients. It&#39;s probably something that<br/>\nis better solved at a custom annotation level than on the basic language<br/>\nlevel.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers, Ilja</div>",
