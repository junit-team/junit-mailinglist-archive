And the discussion shows people feel some need.<br/>\n&gt; Would you agree so far?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>No. I definitely did not mean to say &quot;you cannot discuss about this&quot;. I <br/>\ninvite you to consider 3 other interpretations for &quot;No you can&#39;t, and <br/>\nyou shouldn&#39;t&quot; that do not means &quot;you cannot discuss about this&quot;. (This <br/>\nis a classic exercise from the work of Jerry Weinberg.)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &quot;...becausee those are 3 different tests &quot;<br/>\n&gt; hm,... these ARE 3 different tests because you make them 3 different tests.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>No, they are 3 different tests because a test consists of &quot;given this <br/>\nprecondition, if I perform that action, I expect these results&quot;. Read <br/>\nany book on TDD, programmer testing or JUnit for references.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; What i wanted to point out is:<br/>\n&gt; this is a design decision.<br/>\n&gt; And i had the impression you negate this.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It is absolutely a design decision. JUnit does not support multiple <br/>\nfailing assertions per test in part because it is simpler to stop the <br/>\ntest when it first fails, and in part to encourage strong isolation of <br/>\ntests from each other. This has been part of the TDD literature for <br/>\nyears--Kent Beck, Test-Driven Development: By Example, in particular.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; hope i didn&#39;t hurt you.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You did, but I can recover from it. :) I appreciate your willingness to <br/>\ncontinue the conversation.<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJ.
