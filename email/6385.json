    "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-582594773\">Hello again,<br/>\n<br/>\nI think you misunderstood me.  Let&#39;s say that String.length() returns a<br/>\nwrong length when there&#39;s a zero char in a String.  So, you original code<br/>\nwould have been this:<br/>\n<br/>\npublic void testDomainTest() {<br/>\n    String s = createString(); // Method which potentially returns <br/>\n                               // a String with a character of zero value<br/>\n    assertEquals(12, s.length());<br/>\n}<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, when you encounter the bug, this test fails.  After investigating,<br/>\nyou discover that the JDK platform has the bug.  So now, you should add a<br/>\ntest like this:<br/>\n<br/>\npublic void testStringLengthHasBug() {<br/>\n    String s = &quot;a&#92;u0000a&quot;;<br/>\n    assertEquals(&quot;Bug in JDK returns one less char &quot;<br/>\n                + &quot;per char at zero value&quot;, 2, s.length());<br/>\n}<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd you update your domain code to remove or translate the zero char<br/>\nvalue.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen you next update your JDK, you run your tests again.  Now, the<br/>\ntestStringLengthHasBug() method fails, because the bug was corrected. <br/>\nSo, you can safely remove the foolproof code, and update your domain code<br/>\nto correct the problem.<br/>\n<br/>\nI understand that the example is not quite correct, as you would not<br/>\nnormally have something related to the JDK platform, but this simple<br/>\nexample serves to illustrate my point.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope that helps !<br/>\nFrancois Beausoleil<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOn Fri, 06 Dec 2002 10:09:06 -0800, &quot;Vladimir R. Bossicard&quot;<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:vbossica@...\">vbossica@...</a>&gt; said:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; In my opinion, you should reverse your test.  So, instead of failing<br/>\n&gt; &gt; because the library has bad code, your test now fails if the library has<br/>\n&gt; &gt; *good* code.  Then, you should have another test which tests *your* code<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and makes sure that you prevent the bug from happening.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The problem I have is that now that all my tests pass with a buggy code,<br/>\n&gt; how can I trust my tests?  What will remind me that my code is broken if<br/>\n&gt; my failing tests pass?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; If I&#39;m the only one on the project, I can keep track of the open issues<br/>\n&gt; (like upgrading a library) but things get complicated as soon as you<br/>\n&gt; have some decentralized organization (OSS e.g.)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I think it&#39;s important that you have a red flag somewhere, and possibly<br/>\n&gt; automatic (not a todo list that you may or may not keep up-to-date).<br/>\n&gt; For JUnit-addons, I wrote a validator that checks for tests that are not<br/>\n&gt; starting with &quot;test&quot; and gives a notice.  I think that I will run this<br/>\n&gt; automatically in my build and comment-out my test (like &quot;public void<br/>\n&gt; failing-test&quot;): all my tests now pass but I have an automatic reminder<br/>\n&gt; that they are in fact broken.  The rule will be: all the defined tests<br/>\n&gt; must pass and no test must be commented-out.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -Vladimir<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>&lt;snip /&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://fastmail.fm\">http://fastmail.fm</a> - A fast, anti-spam email service.</div>",
