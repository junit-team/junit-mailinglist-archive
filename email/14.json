Are you just using &quot;TestSummarizer&quot; as the class name?  The JUnit<br/>\n&gt; GUI requires fully-qualified class names, e.g., &quot;summarizer.TestSummarizer&quot;.<br/>\n&gt; The classpath should then point one level up from the &quot;summarizer&quot; package<br/>\n&gt; directory.  (Should be fine as-is from JBuilder, though, I think; I&#39;ve not<br/>\n&gt; used JBuilder, though, so I&#39;m not sure.)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yes! That was the problem. When I created the class, using the JBuilder&#39;s<br/>\nwizard, I had it create a package. When I ran from the IDE and specified<br/>\nsummarizer.TestSummarizer, it worked! (I also made a suite() method)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; If that&#39;s not it, I&#39;m pretty confused too!  Have you tried using the<br/>\n&gt; -classpath command line option instead of the environment variable?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I was also able to get it to work from the command line by adding the<br/>\npath to the class with the &quot;-cp&quot; arg.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe package was the clincher.
