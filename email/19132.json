Dreaming is not a crime you know? :P<br/>\n<br/>\nAny help here is SERIOUSLY appreciated, I&#39;m currently losing hours and hours each day <br/>\nbecause I have to deploy a full JNLP java package in order to test jnlp-enabled application, <br/>\nand I can&#39;t debug them at all.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, automated JUnit testing can&#39;t presently be done AFAIK.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyone knows a solution, or can give me some hints about this problem?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks in advance for any answer</div>",
