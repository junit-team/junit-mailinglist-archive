But if we would use DbUnit, we would have to deal with\nrelational stuff, don&#39;t we? I mean there is this XML dataset file for\nDbUnit which seems to be a simplified SQL create script.\n\nIf I build test data in Java code, it is much easier for me to\nunderstand the data set than if I look at that XML dataset file for\nDbUnit. What if a entity name or a attribute name changes? Then the\nXML dataset file would not work anymore for DbUnit unless it is\nupdated. Much maintainance work and prone to errors.\n\nBesides this, if we create data with our ORM, it can be assured, that\nthe created data is valid because we have validation rules for each\nentity. If someone writes test data for DbUnit in that XML file, then\nno validation is done when the data is created.\n\nFor cleaning up the database we use a so called\n&quot;EntityGarbageCollector&quot; (EGC). As soon as we create an entity, we put\nit in the EGC. In the tearDown method the garbage is diposed, e.g. the\nentities are deleted in a generic way by the EGC.\n\nI am not defending our solution at all cost. Here are many JUnit\nexperts and I would be happy to read your opinion on this topic. So\ndoes DbUnit make sense when using an Object/Relational Mapper?\n\n\n\n",
