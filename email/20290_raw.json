I&#39;ve poked around the net but haven&#39;t gotten much in this\ncategory.=\r\n..\n\nThe root of my question is simple...  Should there be one large &#39;test&#39;\n=\r\nfor each method or one small &#39;test&#39; for each method possibility?\n\nTo explai=\r\nn what I&#39;m asking I have a short example...  Assume the\nfollowing method I&#39;=\r\nd like to test:\n\n     int ReportManager.createReport(Report report)\n\nIn thi=\r\ns particular case, assume I&#39;d like to test the following\ncircumstances...\n\n=\r\n     * Does it throw an exception if report =3D=3D null?\n     * Does it thr=\r\now an exception if report is empty?\n     * Does it throw an exception if re=\r\nport is duplicate?\n     * Does it return a valid ID if successful?\n\nSo give=\r\nn this scenario, how would you do it?  Would you go &#39;one big\ntest&#39;, or &#39;4 s=\r\nmall tests&#39;?\n\n\t1 Test  =3D&gt; testCreateReport\n\t4 Tests =3D&gt; testCreateReport=\r\nNull\n                 testCreateReportEmpty\n                 testCreateRepo=\r\nrtDuplicate\n                 testCreateReportSuccess\n\nI could see benefits =\r\ngoing either way here.  While 1 test would give you\na &#39;hey this method is b=\r\nroken&#39;, and your resulting fail would tell you\nwhy (assuming your comment w=\r\nere appropriate).  On the flip side, having\n4 tests is just as easy since y=\r\nou&#39;d see that single test fail.\n\nComments?
