By  using  a  common  base\n&gt;    TestCase,\n&gt;    I could set up the TLS easily enough without overburdening the unit\n&gt;    tests, I think.\n&gt;    David\n\nI think was you are sensing is a &quot;code smell.&quot;  I don&#39;t have an opinion\nabout the TLS you mentioned but I would suggest using this &quot;pain&quot; to\nforce yourself to refactor some more.  For instance, you could use\nFactories, Delegators|Facades, or Proxies instead polluting your API with\nunneeded args.\n\nOne really good question to ask yourself is &quot;Who can I get to do &#39;this&#39;\nfor me?&quot; as opposed to &quot;How could I do &#39;this&#39;?&quot;  It&#39;s a subtle, but\nprofound, difference.  It pushes the issue off as far as possible of what\nobject will answer &#39;this&#39; question or provide &#39;this&#39; behavior.\n\nYour test (via TDD) is saying, &quot;I want XYZ to do ABC for me.  What will\nit need to do that?  InterfaceA, InterfaceB, InterfaceC... Ok -- I will\ngive those things to it.&quot;  In some cases, that may be the thing to do, in\nothers however it makes more sense for the object you are testing to have\nthose things implicitly available -- your situation sounds a lot like the\nlatter.\n\nHope that helps.\n=jason\n=jason\n[:question | ^One]\n\n",
