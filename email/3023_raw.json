A VFB renders to main memory instead of to a graphics\ncard and basically gives you an easy way to simulate an X server for\ntesting purposes. XFree86 includes a VFB server and most UNIX operating\nsystems (e.g. AIX) seem to include a VFB facility somewhere.\n\nOn Fri, 19 Oct 2001, Chester Kustarz 2 wrote:\n\n&gt; Hello,\n&gt;\n&gt; I am using junit to test some AWT based UI classes that are used in an applet.\n&gt; Under Windows, everything works just fine. When I move over to unix, things\n&gt; are ok so long as I am running a X-Display Server. If I don&#39;t then strange\n&gt; classloading exceptions start being thrown. All of my non-gui unit tests\n&gt; still run fine of course.\n&gt;\n&gt; This would be ok except that I run a daily build every night from cron\n&gt; that does a checkout, compile, and unit test. This unit tests for the GUI\n&gt; classes fail because there is no X-Display attached. My current solutions\n&gt; are:\n&gt; \t1. Only run GUI tests on windows (works, but lame)\n&gt; \t2. Create a &quot;fake&quot; X-Display on unix so the GUI tests can run\n&gt; \t   (I have no idea how to do this)\n&gt; \t3. Something else I didn&#39;t think of\n&gt;\n&gt; Has anybody else run into this sort of thing? If so, how did you approach\n&gt; a soltion?\n&gt;\n&gt; Also of note, the GUI unit tests do not actually display anything. They\n&gt; create, manipulate, add/remove AWT components but never actually write\n&gt; anything to the Display (and therefore don&#39;t read from the Display\n&gt; so I don&#39;t need any features like java.awt.Robot or anything).\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n-- \nEric Vought\nChief Technical Officer - QLUE Consulting, Inc.\n\nevought@... toll-free: 888-771-3538  RTP area: 919-816-9901\n\n\n",
