There&#39;s no doubt \nEnhanced JUnit adds its own bells and whistles over and above the open \nsource goodies it includes.  Indeed, distributing tests across separate \nVMs is unique.  But Dave&#39;s use of the word &quot;community&quot; above struck a \nchord with me.  \n\nAs a member of this community, and the open source community in general, \nit got me to thinking about the licenses I use for the stuff I build. \n Anything I craft in the future may just be licensed such that \ncommercial redistribution rights are only available by writing me. \n Non-commercial redistribution, and its use in the development of \nnon-commercial products, will be freely granted.  In other words, if I \ncontribute to this community in good faith, commercial vendors have to \nask before leveraging my wares.  \n\nI guess I expected that type of communication would happen naturally \ninside of a community.  It won&#39;t be the first time I&#39;ve been naive, nor \nthe last.  Live and learn.\n\nMike\n\n-- \nMike Clark\nClarkware Consulting Inc.\nhttp://www.clarkware.com \n\n\n\n\n",
