Test everything that could possibly not work.<br/>\n&gt; 2. Test everything that you fear does not work.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>The flip side of that is that if your are practicing TDD it&#39;s never an<br/>\nissue... if there is code, it&#39;s only there because there was a test<br/>\nthat required it.. so there&#39;s never any question... you nevere have to<br/>\nask &quot;Must I text X&quot;... but you ask &quot;How do I test X&quot;.. where X is some<br/>\nbehaviour.. not some method... so things like setters are not<br/>\n(typically) behaviour.. they&#39;re implementation details.<br/>\n<br/>\nDave</div>",
