After <br/>\n&gt;searching thru documentation, this news group and other sources, some <br/>\n&gt;issues still remain that I hope some of you can help answer.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;    1. We have a need to put some trace messages in the tests so as <br/>\n&gt;to know the progress of the test itself because each test can be <br/>\n&gt;fairly timeconsuming. Is there a way to have these capture this <br/>\n&gt;output for an individual test in the GUI-based TestRunner? I see only <br/>\n&gt;thing that is captured for each test on the UI are the assertion <br/>\n&gt;failures. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>My guess is that if TestListener doesn&#39;t have something to allow you to<br/>\nlog progress messages, then you can easily add something to it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;    2. I see that JUnitReport is used quite extensively with Ant. <br/>\n&gt;&gt;From what I learnt reading, it helps output TestResult in XML format <br/>\n&gt;and then one can translate it using XSLT. Know how one can use that <br/>\n&gt;without having to use Ant? Any resources on Net would be helpful.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Hm. Your best bet is to look at the source of the JUnitReport task and<br/>\nyou should be able to tell, from that, how to use it outside Ant.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;   3. I see JUnit is great for nesting sub-suites within a suite and <br/>\n&gt;thereby creating a tree of suites. But when it comes to test results, <br/>\n&gt;is there a way to get a breakup of which sub-suite had how many <br/>\n&gt;failures from TestResult?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>If you want to map a TestSuite object to the collection of<br/>\nFailures/Errors generated by its tests, then your best bet is likely to<br/>\nregister an extra TestListener, which you can do by changing the<br/>\nTestRunner you usually use.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve never tried to do these things, so I can only give you a<br/>\nbest-guess at a starting-point.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you get this stuff working, please write an article about it!<br/>\n<br/>\nJ.
