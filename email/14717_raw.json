It&#39;s a symptom that TDD discipline is breaking down.\n&gt;Code has been written before a test that needed it. Now&#39;s the time to\n&gt;back away from the current implementation, write the test you /really/\n&gt;want, and then get to green. \n&gt;  \n&gt;\nNot necessarily true. Consider this: I&#39;m using TDD. I write some tests \nand code in the usual cycle.\n\nI now have a new feature I want to write a test for. I look at the code, \nnotice that there is a private method that does that work - that&#39;s where \nthe new code will go. I can write a perfectly adequate test focused on \nthat private method alone - but I can&#39;t test private methods. So I \nrefactor to extract the method to an appropriate class (possibly new). I \nrun existing tests. I then write the test I _really_ want against the \nnewly exposed public method.\n\nThat&#39;s the sort of thing _I_ mean when I say it&#39;s not tested enough: it \nmeans that there are tests I want to write which would be convenient to \nwrite if I can target them better.\n\nI&#39;ll reuse my String-to-Calendar example. I want to do some work with a \ndate, but I have a String. So I write a test that passes in the \ndate-string, and sees that it the work is done. Then I want to do some \nerror handling, so I write a test that passes in an invalid date-string, \nand I see the appropriate exception get passed out.\n\nNow I want to handle the twenty five thousand different ways that users \ntype in dates. I&#39;ve already extracted the String-to-Calendar conversion \nto a method. Because I&#39;m using whitebox testing, I know I don&#39;t have to \ntest the earlier method with the twenty five thousand ways of entering a \ndate - that would just be silly and result in a lot of extra test work. \nInstead, I take that method and I move it to a DateUtil class. I then \nwrite the tests for the tweny five thousand ways of entering a date \nagainst _that_ class instead. I would probably have also extracted a \nmethod with the same name as the earlier one, but with a Calendar \nargument instead of a String - I would probably make that method public \non the same class.\n\nThis sort of work is exactly how I do my TDD work, and nearly always \nwhat I see when I look at a private method someone else wants to test.\n\nRobert.\n\n-- \n               &quot;Software is too expensive to build cheaply&quot;\nRobert Watkins         http://twasink.net/          robertdw@...\n\n\n",
