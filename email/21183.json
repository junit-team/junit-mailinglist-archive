I also think it&#39;s easy to over-state JUnit&#39;s<br/>\nimportance to a hosting provider: as far as I know, we&#39;ve never cracked the<br/>\ntop 50 projects at SourceForge--we release rather infrequently, and many,<br/>\nmany people get JUnit for free with Eclipse, maven, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\n   David Saff<br/>\n<br/>\nOn Wed, Dec 10, 2008 at 12:59 PM, Joakim Ohlrogge &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:joakim.ohlrogge@...\">joakim.ohlrogge@...</a><br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;   I know sharesource <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.sharesource.org\">http://www.sharesource.org</a> hosts both mercurial and<br/>\n&gt; SVN, I&#39;m not sure whether the same source can be accessed in both ways<br/>\n&gt; or not. We are using mercurial at my company and it works well on both<br/>\n&gt; windox, linux and mac. What is mainly lacking is good ide support but<br/>\n&gt; I say that netbeans support mercurial natively now so maybe that is<br/>\n&gt; worth a try.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Sharesource does not seem to have any export restrictions but is<br/>\n&gt; lacking review features as far as I know. But it has this certain warm<br/>\n&gt; fuzzy family &quot;niceness&quot; to it and does not feel as big and bulky as<br/>\n&gt; sourceforge does. I felt had to mention sharesource because I like it,<br/>\n&gt; I also think that whatever is lacking in features would be looked into<br/>\n&gt; in order to accomodate such a well known project such as JUnit, but<br/>\n&gt; thats just how I reasoning if I was running sharesource :)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; In my book a distributed vcs such as Git, mercurial or bazaar would be<br/>\n&gt; a big plus.<br/>\n&gt; /J<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; On Tue, Dec 9, 2008 at 8:24 PM, mark_p_thornton<br/>\n&gt; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mark.p.thornton@...\">mark.p.thornton@...</a> &lt;mark.p.thornton%40ntlworld.com&gt;&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a> &lt;junit%40yahoogroups.com&gt;, &quot;Nat Pryce&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &lt;nat.pryce@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; 2008/12/8 Shane Mingins &lt;shane.mingins@...&gt;:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Have you considered git and github ... just as a thought?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://github.com/\">http://github.com/</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Not sure how that fits in the Java space or not.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; It&#39;s more of a problem for people working on Windows.
