For example, the JUnit Web page seems to have had few\n&gt; updates since 2003. And on SourceForge, Erich Gamma and Kent Beck\n&gt; responded to some GUI-related RFEs with the comment that because most\n&gt; IDEs now handle test running themselves, there&#39;s no point to improving\n&gt; JUnit&#39;s own GUI tools. Non-interface bug reports and RFEs have gone\n&gt; unassigned unless they&#39;re of very high priority (such as ones related to\n&gt; thread safety). Is there simply no real demand for improvements, or has\n&gt; the SourceForge bug report page been deprecated?\n\nThat&#39;s an ongoing debate in the community. I honestly believe that the \nJUnit framework is closed (in the Open/Closed Principle sense), even if \nthe test runners are occasionally inadequate. Since I use Eclipse&#39;s test \nrunner most of the time and Ant&#39;s the rest of the time, that&#39;s not an \nissue for me.\n\nJUnit 4.0, complete with support for Java annotations, is in the works, \nbut I don&#39;t know any more than that.\n-- \nJ.
