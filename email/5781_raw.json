Does it test that the method \nfails if called with an i=\r\nnvalid value?\n\nHi,\n\nThe @pre tag is used for jtest, it does a couple things=\r\n... Helps to \nconstrain the generated input args and helps to check relatio=\r\nnship \nbehavior between classes.\n\nFor example, if the method throws excepti=\r\non when Vector size is \ngreater than 10 (exception found by Jtest), the dev=\r\neloper says, \nvector size is handled by the caller and is never going to be=\r\n beyond \na certain range (an implied precondition -- every method has impli=\r\ned \ncontracts)...the contract can be made explicit so that it may be \ncheck=\r\ned programmatically as in below:\n\n/**\n * @pre vector_arg.size () &lt;=3D 10\n *=\r\n/\n\nu can also do things like:\n\n/**\n * @pre callMyMethodToCheckStateIsOK () =\r\n=3D=3D true\n */\n\nAnd that method can do things like check db connection and=\r\n so forth.\n\nJtest will constrain it&#39;s input generation so it does not viola=\r\nte the \n@pre condition.  Contracts can also validate through class \nrelatio=\r\nnships, for example:\n\nIf &quot;class A&quot; calls methods in &quot;class B&quot; and Jtest is =\r\ntesting &quot;class \nA&quot;, IT WILL TRY to generate input to A&#39;s methods which brea=\r\nk B&#39;s \ncontracts, hence letting you know there is a possibilty that the \ncl=\r\nass relationship is not well defined...let me know if u need more \nelaborat=\r\nion on this point.\n\nCarson\nParaSoft Support\n\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In junit@y..., &quot;rxq=\r\nch&quot; &lt;rxqch@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Hi, I work with parasoft tech support and the=\r\n answer to the\n&gt; &gt; question \n&gt; &gt; &gt; below is yes.
