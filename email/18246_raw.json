From the point whe=\r\nre I submit my tests, I know that no\nmatter what\n&gt; code gets checked in aft=\r\ner me, the functionality of the system will not\n&gt; decrease.\n&gt; \n&gt; Tests also=\r\n help a great deal make my code more robust.\n&gt; \n&gt; But drive my design with =\r\ntests? That&#39;s dangerous and can potentially\nlead to\n&gt; micro-design, i.e. de=\r\nsign without seeing the big picture (&quot;I&#39;ll use this\n&gt; signature because the=\r\n test looks cleaner then&quot;).\n&gt; \n&gt; -- \n&gt; C=EF=BF=BDdric\n&gt; http://testng.org\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; \n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt;\n\nI agree wit=\r\nh Joakim Ohlrogge; a biggest benefit of use TDD is guide\nyour design.
