Second, as I&#39;ve <br/>\n&gt; said elsewhere, I think this is not a useful example.  I find <br/>\n&gt; that I end up with very few tests that actually want to say<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I actually had this for a while in my own C# framework. Even without<br/>\nthe parentheses, I didn&#39;t find the And syntax that readable. It&#39;s<br/>\nnot the sort of thing people expect in a curly-brace language.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; assertTrue( 2 &lt; n && n &lt; 10, &quot;n should be inside the (2, 10) <br/>\n&gt; interval&quot;);<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; whether I&#39;m using assertThat or not.  Do you?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It&#39;s always occasional for me and, with one exception, it&#39;s easy to <br/>\nsubstitute two asserts for it anyway. The exception is when I want<br/>\nto make multiple tests over every item in a collection. In that case,<br/>\nI either use & - which I do support - or simply build up the constraint<br/>\nin lines of code. It&#39;s not as readable as separate asserts, but it allows<br/>\nme to pass over the collection only once without writing an explicit loop.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome people would probably prefer the loop - not a problem. :-)<br/>\n <br/>\n&lt;snip/&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; 2) Just as I find that the pressure to make my classes <br/>\n&gt; testable results in designs that appeal to me, regardless of <br/>\n&gt; testability, I find that assertThat pressures me to create <br/>\n&gt; designs that have easily asserted-on values.  For example, <br/>\n&gt; where before I might have written:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; assertTrue(process.finished() && process.returnValue() == 0),<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m more likely to write (partially _because_ of the <br/>\n&gt; clunkiness of the constraint syntax):<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; assertThat(process.status(), eq(Process.SUCCESSFUL_RETURN));<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Now, I&#39;ve found a new class, ProcessStatus, that proves <br/>\n&gt; useful in rendering progress bars and info logs.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Now this gets to a quality of test framework apis that I find<br/>\nmore important than readability: we could clal it writability<br/>\nI guess, or expressibility. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nIf it&#39;s easy to express things naturally, you will tend to<br/>\ncreate and interfaces that are natural to use. I can&#39;t prove<br/>\nthat, but having experimented with this paradigm, I know <br/>\nit has been true for me.<br/>\n<br/>\nCharlie</div>",
