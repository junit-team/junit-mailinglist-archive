Rainsberger wrote:\n&gt; Although I can relate to all the things you wrote, I&#39;m stuck with one\n&gt; logical quandary.\n&gt;\n&gt; If Pluggable Selector is OK for JUnit, then why isn&#39;t it OK for the code\n&gt; I was writing, which happened to choose rule methods the same way JUnit\n&gt; chooses test methods?\n\nIt beats me if it&#39;s OK.  You asked what the difference could possibly \nbe.  I laid out that the difference might be reuse patterns.  We \ndisagree on this point, but I claim no knowledge of whether your \noriginal design was good.  Frankly, you sound like an experienced \ndesigner, and I like clever designs, so on that point, we may very well \nbe on the same side.\n\n&gt; You wonder whether it matters how heavily reused the code is. So, if\n&gt; this is code only my team will use, then it&#39;s not OK; but if it&#39;s code I\n&gt; plan to put into a general-purpose, widely-used rule engine[1]\n\nI&#39;d be interested in what that footnote was supposed to be.  :-)\n\n&gt; , then\n&gt; it&#39;s OK. I don&#39;t buy that at all. Ignoring the effort to write the code\n&gt; this way, its value might increase the more it&#39;s used, but that doesn&#39;t\n&gt; mean it has negative value when it&#39;s not widely used. It would seem that\n&gt; the more people who try to use a clever design, the more that clever\n&gt; design costs, if you include the cost of supporting the people trying to\n&gt; use it. As a result, I&#39;d argue the opposite: the fewer people who use\n&gt; it, the more we can afford to be clever.\n\nGood point.  I wonder if there&#39;s a lot we could learn about the \ncost/benefit analysis of cleverness.  I think that the strongest claim \nwe could probably agree on is that we&#39;re most likely to win if each \nperson that learns the metaphor ends up using it thousands of times \nregularly, rather than a handful of times separated by months on end.\n\n&gt; In my case, JUnit /was/ the metaphor: rule methods are collected\n&gt; automatically like test methods, and if any rule fails, the whole\n&gt; ruleset fails. To anyone with any JUnit experience, I think that works\n&gt; well. This is why I was surprised to see many JUnit users balk at it. So\n&gt; there must be something else to it, and frankly, I can&#39;t see what it is\n&gt; beyond those people deciding arbitrarily. That&#39;s fine, but I don&#39;t want\n&gt; people to dress it up as more than that when that&#39;s what it is.\n\nIt sounds like this is a question you should address to those JUnit \nusers.  Did they give you concrete feedback, or simply &quot;Nope, don&#39;t like \nit&quot;, or was there another design that enthralled them?\n\nThanks,\n\n    David Saff\n\n",
