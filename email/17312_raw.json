Isn&#39;t it obvious that quite often, the\n&gt;  former approach will take longer than the latter?\n\nI think it _can_ be like that but it is often hard to know up front\nwhen it _will_ be like that. What you&#39;re after, I think, is to compare\n&quot;TDD religiously&quot; to &quot;TDD pragmatically&quot;. The second sure has a nice\nring to it compared to the first. The advantage of the first IMO is\nthat you never have to think wether to go one way or the other, you\njust &quot;do&quot; which also saves time given that it is the right descision\nmost of the time.\n\n\nNow to your &quot;above&quot; examples that I moved to be &quot;below&quot;:\n\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; With test first, you have something like:  Test v1, Code v1, Test v2,\n&gt;  &gt; Code\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; v2, Test v3, Code v3.  Check in.\n\nTo me Test v1, Code v1, Test v2, code v2, Test v3, Code v3. Check in.\nsounds bigger than:\nTest a little, code a little, test a little, code a little, test a\nlittle code a little. Check in\n\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; If you postpone your testing a bit, you have:  Code v1, Code v2, Code\n&gt;  &gt; v3,\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; Test v3, Commit.\n\nWhile this sure /looks/ attractive I think the comparison seems overly\nsimplified. I have a few questions:\n\n- I&#39;m not convinced that the tasks are of the same size in your two\nexamples. Can you really just count them to make a conclusion which is\nfaster?\n\n- A big part of writing a test is thinking about how something should\nwork so that you can code it. I don&#39;t see that part disapearing when\nyou remove the test. Question is, will thinking be easier, harder or\nthe same when you defer the test-part?\n\n- If you can code it, you know how it works...  then shouldn&#39;t writing\na test be fast?\n\n- If you don&#39;t know how to code it so that you have to redo things a\ncouple of times. Aren&#39;t tests good for exploring those situations?\nCouldn&#39;t it even be faster or to you do things in more steps?\n\n- Will the above be faster/better for beginners or experienced coders?\nIn your opinion does it matter?\n\n- What about the design? Do you think you will have the same\nadvantages when &quot;retrofitting&quot; tests or does that depend on who wrote\nthe code initially?\n\n\nYou can always make the choice to write the tests after but wouldn&#39;t\nyou be missing out on a lot of the really good stuff?\n\n&gt;  &gt; &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; The latter approach will get you to your goal much faster.\n\nI think in /most/ situations, from /my/ experience /I/ disagree.\n\n/Joakim Ohlrogge\n\n",
