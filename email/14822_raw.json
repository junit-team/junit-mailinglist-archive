I would like to be\n&gt; able to pass my test cases the object to use for creating lists so\n&gt; that I can have a different untility class for each impelmentation. So\n&gt; I need to be able to pass a untility object to each test case before\n&gt; it runs any of the tests. So far I haven&#39;t found a way to do this JUnit.\n\nStandard trick: make your test case class abstract, with an\nabstract method delivering the create-a-list object.\n\nSubclass three times, once for each implementation, defining\nthat abstract method to return this implementation&#39;s create-a-list\nobject.\n\nNow create a suite from those three subclasses. \n\nVoila. \n\n-- \nChris &quot;electric hedgehog&quot; Dollin\nLogic is rational /re/construction.
