Think of the EJB model as a host, an environment for your<br/>\napplication to run in. The benefits<br/>\nhere is resource pooling versioning, handling lots of transactions,<br/>\nthreading issues and generally things you<br/>\ndon&#39;t want to care about. Your business logic should be testable outside<br/>\nthat model. When you&#39;re unit testing<br/>\nyou have no need for handling lots of simultanious requests so leave that<br/>\nout of the picture until you write system<br/>\ntests, system tests are different in nature and requires different tools (I<br/>\nthink this is where EJBUnit comes in I might be wrong<br/>\nabout that I haven&#39;t used it)<br/>\n<br/>\nWe use Spring, with the spring model, a session bean becomes an empty shell<br/>\nthat delegates to your business objects defined within your spring-context.<br/>\n<br/>\nWether you use spring or not, the same pattern still applies, let the<br/>\napplication<br/>\ncontainer take care of the application container stuff (life cycle events,<br/>\npooling, etc), trust<br/>\nyour container to do that well and test your business objects outside of the<br/>\nsession beans.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you are using CMP:s beans (look carefully at the alternative persistance<br/>\nsolutions here if you havn&#39;t already picked one)<br/>\nyou can inject mock home interfaces to your business logic classes which<br/>\ngives a quite nice abstraction to the hairy details.<br/>\n<br/>\nOnce again, Spring provides quite a lot of goodies in the EJB-context so do<br/>\nhave a look at it, it is well worth the small effort.<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope this helps, ask if anything is not clear.<br/>\nRegards<br/>\nJoakim Ohlrogge<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On 6/7/06, saibabu_valluripalli &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:saibabu_valluripalli@...\">saibabu_valluripalli@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   Hi,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I started exploring on JUnit, Can any one help me on unit testing EJB?<br/>\n&gt; Thank you very much in advance.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Regards,<br/>\n&gt; Sai<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed] </span></blockquote></div>",
