First, the naming convention tells\n&gt; you that a method is a constructor. Understanding Java should tell you\n&gt; everything you need to know about why that method is there. A\n&gt; constructor&#39;s job is to ensure that an object is usable and &quot;ready to\n&gt; rock&quot; when it&#39;s handed off. Part of an object being &quot;ready to rock&quot;,\n&gt; is that it should be fully loaded and in a guaranteed valid state.\n&gt; Telling people to do the least amount possible in a constructor is\n&gt; encouraging them to hand out objects that are (potentially) in an\n&gt; invalid internal state. That will get you a &quot;reading of the riot act&quot;\n&gt; on any project that I&#39;m leading. An object must _always_ have a valid\n&gt; internal state. As programs run in more and more multithreaded\n&gt; environments these days, this rule becomes even more important. You\n&gt; _never_ know when your object might be accessed, therefore it should\n&gt; _always_ be ready for access.\n\nYou know, I almost said this myself, but I think point 5 implicitly \naddresses this. I suspect this could be made a little clearer in the \narticle, but I&#39;m not really sure the author and you actually disagree here.\n\n&gt; \n&gt; Point five. I agree up to a point. There will always be some things\n&gt; that need to be done in specific sequences. Opening and closing files\n&gt; leaps to mind at this point.\n&gt; \n\nHowever this can conflict with your response to point 1. What if a \nconstructor needs to open a file? And for that matter why do files have \nto be opened anyway? Perhaps file writes and reads should auto-open and \nclose files as necessary. We used to think we had to explicitly allocate \nand free memory, but we don&#39;t do that any more. Why do we treat files \nthe same way?\n\n\n-- \n﻿Elliotte Rusty Harold  elharo@...\nJava I/O 2nd Edition Just Published!\nhttp://www.cafeaulait.org/books/javaio2/\nhttp://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0596527500/ref=nosim/cafeaulaitA/\n\n",
