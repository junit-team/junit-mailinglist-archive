If the <br/>\n&gt; schema changes, I find it more convenient to go to one known <br/>\n&gt; place instead of having to search my entire app for possible changes.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I find statements like this rather curious. Any decent (well, IMHO) IDE/editor/etc. should support global search and replace functionality. &quot;Search my entire app for possible changes&quot; in eclipse is all of: &quot;Type ctrl-h, type in regex, hit enter&quot;, and boom, you have every point in your entire app that requires changing. In many cases, you put in the replacement value and your entire change is done in one simple step.<br/>\n<br/>\nIs this a case where tools change the rules? Ie. Yes, if you had to do this by hand, it would be a nuisance. But really, noone should have to do that by hand anymore with all the tools available.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd there&#39;s a full suite of unit tests so we can make sure that this global search and replace (that would probably scare some people--but shouldn&#39;t!) didn&#39;t break anything so we can do so mercilessly?<br/>\n<br/>\nJoel Shellman</div>",
