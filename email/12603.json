    "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1083478509\">Of course.  I&#39;m not afraid to write long method names, but sometimes<br/>\nit gets out of hand and I need a paragraph to explain the situation. <br/>\nGenerally, this is testing some kind of complicated business logic,<br/>\nwhere the word &quot;logic&quot; here is often a cruel double-entendre.  An<br/>\nexample:<br/>\n<br/>\npublic void testMultipleCustomerPurchaseOrderEntriesForOneSalesOrderLine();<br/>\n<br/>\nThe test method is about a page of code, on the heavy side of the<br/>\naverage for our codebase but nothing gigantic.  Still, I felt it<br/>\nneeded a comment in plain english, which is:<br/>\n<br/>\nTests that this mapper creates multiple customerPurchaseOrder entries<br/>\nassociated with the sales order line, when multiples exist across line<br/>\nitems.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis particular example is partly about readability (you could infer a<br/>\nlot of the information, possibly, from the method name) and part about<br/>\ndisambiguity.  There are other tests involving CustomerPurchaseOrders<br/>\nand Sales Order Lines that are similar.<br/>\n<br/>\nMost of the time, these comments are written before the test.  I guess<br/>\nyou could say I practice document-first test development.  I write a<br/>\nsentence or two about what the test is going to do (or just a method<br/>\nname if it suffices -- you&#39;re right that it often does) then I write<br/>\nthe test.<br/>\n<br/>\nUltimately, why wouldn&#39;t you want to write actual sentences?  I like<br/>\nJava a lot, but English was my first language.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Kevin<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Wed, 5 Jan 2005 10:25:36 -0700, Mike Clark &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mike@...\">mike@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; Have you tried communicating what a test method is intended to do in<br/>\n&gt; the name of the test method itself?
