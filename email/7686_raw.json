This is a \nJUnit extension targeted for database-driven projects that puts your \ndatabase into a known state between test runs.\n\nI usually use both Mock and DbUnit. I mostly use DbUnit to test the \nPersistence Logic. Then the Business Logic can be tested with a Mock \nimplementation of the Persistence Logic or using the true implementation \nwith DbUnit. As described by Paul Christmann, the latter tests are more \nFunctional tests than Unit tests. Running Mock tests is obviously a lot \nfaster!\n\nManuel Laflamme\n\n--------------- On 04/10/2003 07:10:14 AM &quot;javainsel&quot; wrote: \n---------------\n&gt; A coworker suggested that we don&#39;t use Mock objects because he thinks \n&gt;that it is better to test everything together (code, framework, \n&gt;application server and database).\n&gt;\n&gt;It have problems to convince him.\n&gt;\n&gt;He wants to include two methods in the JUnit tests: makeTestData() \n&gt;and deleteTestData(). The first method would be called before the \n&gt;testing is started. The second method he wants to call after testing \n&gt;is finished.\n&gt;\n&gt;What he wants is to do in makeTestData() is to write test data into \n&gt;the database for testing purposes. So he thinks we don&#39;t need Mock \n&gt;objects.\n&gt;\n&gt;We are not experienced both. But I read a lot of Mock objects.\n&gt;\n&gt;He also objects that the JUnit testing would be done only with Mock \n&gt;objects.\n&gt;\n&gt;What do you think? Is it better to use Mock objects or to do it like \n&gt;my coworker wants?\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt;\n&gt;Yahoo!
