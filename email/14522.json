Have you tried going at it incrementally?  <br/>\nGo ahead and write the unit tests for two or three of your classes, <br/>\ncutting and pasting if necessary.  Then go back and see what you have to <br/>\ndo to remove the duplication.  I often find this to be an effective way <br/>\nto make an abstract question concrete.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf, in the midst of doing this exercise, you find yourself with a small, <br/>\nfocused example of a place where you would be tempted to use multiple <br/>\ninheritance, please post it.  I&#39;m willing to bet, with even odds, that <br/>\nyou&#39;ll quickly find other ways of gracefully doing what you need.  Good <br/>\nluck,<br/>\n<br/>\n    David Saff<br/>\n<br/>\nJava Questions wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; Hi everyone,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m faced with a &quot;design problem&quot; and I was hoping that some<br/>\n&gt; experienced developer could help me figure out how to sort it out.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I use a lot of small interfaces in my application, each of which has a<br/>\n&gt; very precise purpose. Most of my &quot;concrete&quot; classes implement more<br/>\n&gt; than one of these interfaces.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Now, I was hoping to find a way to refactor my tests so that each<br/>\n&gt; interface has its own abstract TestCase. Then, if multiple inheritance<br/>\n&gt; was allowed in Java, I could simply implement each classes concrete<br/>\n&gt; classe&#39;s TestCase by inheriting from all the appropriate &quot;interface<br/>\n&gt; TestCases&quot;.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; This would allow me to inherit all the general purpose fixtures and<br/>\n&gt; simply add some new fixtures targeted for the concrete classe&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; specific behavior. In a way, I simply want to enforce the &quot;Liskov<br/>\n&gt; Substitution Principle&quot; as simply as possible...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I know multiple inheritance isn&#39;t allowed in Java and should be<br/>\n&gt; avoided anyway but I&#39;d like to find a simple way to keep the general<br/>\n&gt; idea of &quot;interface specific super TestCases&quot; and apply it to classes<br/>\n&gt; implementing several of these interfaces.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Is the general idea a good one ? If it is, what is  the best way to <br/>\n&gt; achieve it ?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thanks in advance,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; D.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; YAHOO!
