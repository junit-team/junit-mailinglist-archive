Having quite figured it out on the\n&gt;&gt; &gt;assertEq=\r\nuals, but on the assertTrue I us something like this this:\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;assertT=\r\nrue(!image.isChild());\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;------------------------------------------=\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;Robert D=\r\niFalco &lt;rdifalco@t...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt; &gt;Yeah, it is a little odd. We have an Abst=\r\nractTestCase and we just added\n&gt;&gt; &gt;the two version of #assertNotEquals ther=\r\ne. We also added an\n&gt;&gt; &gt;#assertEqualsSameHash which makes sure that if two =\r\nobjects are equal,\n&gt;&gt; &gt;that their hashes are also equal.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Hmm... mayb=\r\ne you wanted something like GSBase&#39;s EqualsTester,\n&gt;instead. Tests that use=\r\n assertEquals() must assume that equals()\n&gt;works. If you want to test equal=\r\ns(), that ought to be done separately.\n&gt;You have some subtle test coupling =\r\nthere that could lead you to forget\n&gt;that equals()/hashCode() *may not* wor=\r\nk.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Take care.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; J.

Let me ma=\r\nke that clear.\n\nI was responding to Robert&#39;s mention of adding assertEquals=\r\nSameHash() &quot;which makes sure that if two objects are equal, then their hash=\r\nes are also equal.&quot; My comment was specifically about this statement. I oug=\r\nht to have removed more of the surrounding context to make that more clear.=\r\n If Robert is using assertEqualsSameHash() in the context of testing the eq=\r\nuals() method, that&#39;s perfect; but if he&#39;s using it in other tests and rely=\r\ning on its failure to signal a problem with equals()/hashCode(), then he is=\r\n coupling his tests in a manner that, I strongly suspect, will bite him in =\r\nthe ass in due time. It did for me.\n\n&lt;snip /&gt;\n&gt;And while I could go out and=\r\n get third party extensions, I prefer to\n&gt;stick with the published regular =\r\ndistribution, warts and all.\n\nI find this attitude curious. If JUnit doesn&#39;=\r\nt do what you need, then use something else! If you can&#39;t change JUnit, and=\r\n it doesn&#39;t change quickly enough for you, then add onto it. That&#39;s what GS=\r\nBase, JUnit-addons and all other projects are there for.\n\n&gt;I had always ass=\r\numed that the JUnit developers had some strong reason\n&gt;for overlooking such=\r\n an obvious thing.  But maybe not.  If not, please\n&gt;consider adding assertN=\r\notEquals for the next release.\n\nI&#39;m sure it&#39;s on the list, but if not, go t=\r\no the Sourceforge project page and make your feelings known. JUnit is slow =\r\nto change. You generally get more out of JUnit by using the extensions than=\r\n by waiting for JUnit to change.\n\nGood luck.\n\n\nJ. B.
