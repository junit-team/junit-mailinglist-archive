B. Rainsberger [mailto:jbrains@roge=\r\nrs.com]\n&gt; Sent: Thursday, July 03, 2003 11:29 AM\n&gt; To: junit@...=\r\nm\n&gt; Subject: Re: [junit] Unit test java documentation\n[snip]\n&gt; \n&gt; A top tim=\r\ne-waster on software projects is writing useless \n&gt; documentation instead o=\r\nf clear code.\n\nI would agree that useless documentation is worse than clear=\r\n code, but then useless documentation is probably worse than messy code (as=\r\n long as the code at least works). However, I disagree with the statement -=\r\n unless you got something other than your own experience to back that state=\r\nment up with.\n\n\n&gt; PS: Yes, I&#39;ve worked on a project where no external \n&gt; do=\r\ncumentation was required. When a new employee came on board \n&gt; and began wo=\r\nrking with the code, he said, &quot;This code is so \n&gt; easy to read, I already u=\r\nnderstand what&#39;s going on.&quot; Since I \n&gt; also benefited from the easy-to-read=\r\n code while I was \n&gt; building the system, the effort I put into making the =\r\ncode \n&gt; self-documenting was well worth it. In other words, if the \n&gt; code =\r\ntells the story, then that is often enough.\n\nThis paragraph I really disagr=\r\nee with. I have walked into far too many shops where the programmers produc=\r\ned code that they thought was easy to read, but in fact wasn&#39;t. Just becaus=\r\ne it is &quot;clear code&quot; to you and possibly your team - doesn&#39;t mean that it w=\r\nill be looked upon as &quot;clear code&quot; by the people that follow you.\n\tFrankly =\r\nhaving a new employee walk in the door and comment how &quot;easy the code is to=\r\no read&quot; isn&#39;t that amazing or even points to the fact that the code is in f=\r\nact easy to read. He they know you favor &quot;easy to ready code&quot; they might ha=\r\nve been just saying that to get a positive response or to push up their own=\r\n capabilities in your eyes. Sure, your code could in fact be the most reada=\r\nble code in existence, but a new employee pushing a positive response is no=\r\nt a good indicator - its simply human nature.\n\n\n\nChip\n-----\nProgramming: It=\r\ns not just a job - its an indenture \n\n\n\n",
