I will have a look at it. But I stil=\r\nl think it\nwould be good to have the possibility to enable rules globally.\n=\r\nRegards!\n\n\n2013/4/30 Matthew Farwell &lt;matthew@...&gt;\n\n&gt; Hello,\n&gt;\n&gt; =\r\nAre you using maven?\n&gt;\n&gt; If so, one option that you could possibly consider=\r\n is using a different\n&gt; provider to surefire.\n&gt;\n&gt; A provider is a class whi=\r\nch knows how to run a set of tests. There is a\n&gt; provider for JUnit3, JUnit=\r\n pre 4.7 and JUnit post 4.7. JUnit post 4.7 uses\n&gt; the JUnitCore, which you=\r\n could replace with your own version, which inserts\n&gt; the same rule everywh=\r\nere.\n&gt;\n&gt; It seems (at first glance) to be a better way to get global behavi=\r\nour from\n&gt; your jenkins server.\n&gt;\n&gt; Matthew Farwell.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; 2013/4/30 Hennin=\r\ng Gro=DF &lt;igaffai@...&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; **\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Hi Kevin!\n&gt; &gt; Thank =\r\nyou very much for your feedback! First some words to the\n&gt; environment:\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; In the project I need the feature we currently have 9 developers and i=\r\nt\n&gt; &gt; might be more. Even freelancers. There are something around 20k tests=\r\n.\n&gt; What\n&gt; &gt; we want to achieve is to enable a global timeout rule that app=\r\nlies\n&gt; &gt; different timeouts to tests depending on their category (eg\n&gt; Slow=\r\nTests.class\n&gt; &gt; may take longer than other tests). Also there are other thi=\r\nngs to take\n&gt; into\n&gt; &gt; consideration (eg is some context already loaded, ot=\r\nherwise the timeout\n&gt; &gt; will be increased).\n&gt; &gt; This rule already exists an=\r\nd is registered in some abstract base class.\n&gt; Its\n&gt; &gt; working fine.\n&gt; &gt; Ha=\r\nving this amount of tests makes it very hard to make sure that every\n&gt; &gt; cl=\r\nass is annotated with it. Also not all tests inherit from the abstract\n&gt; &gt; =\r\ntest class and I would like to keep it that way. It would be just some\n&gt; wo=\r\nrk\n&gt; &gt; to put the rule in every test but what about tests written in the fu=\r\nture.\n&gt; &gt; I need to make sure that the rule is applied to every test especi=\r\nally\n&gt; when\n&gt; &gt; the developer forgets about it. Its a rule that is intended=\r\n to avoid\n&gt; &gt; developers slowing down jenkins build by writing slow tests w=\r\nithout\n&gt; &gt; annotating them as such.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; That said using a different run=\r\nner is not an option. Also we already\n&gt; have a\n&gt; &gt; hard time mixing spring-=\r\nrunner, mockito-runner, junitparam-runner (btw\n&gt; &gt; we/you should copy some =\r\nof that behaviour as it is a lot more flexible\n&gt; than\n&gt; &gt; junit parameteriz=\r\ned test [1])) aso-behaviour (btw: we/you need to think\n&gt; &gt; about the runner=\r\n-concept. it would be a lot better to have one runner and\n&gt; &gt; registering b=\r\nehaviour to it (eg being able to register as many &quot;runners&quot;\n&gt; as\n&gt; &gt; I want=\r\n to).\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Scanning classpath is a good thing. We already use classpaths=\r\nuite [2].\n&gt; That\n&gt; &gt; enables us to create suites without having to specify =\r\nall classes in it\n&gt; &gt; (another feature that would very well fit junit). We =\r\ncould for example\n&gt; &gt; annotate a rule with a classifier (basepacke, package=\r\n or\n&gt; package.classname)\n&gt; &gt; and it would get applied to everything that ma=\r\ntches. But this kind of\n&gt; &gt; behaviour would introduce a completely new way =\r\nof configuration to junit\n&gt; (a\n&gt; &gt; little cdi/spring-ish). Maybe it would b=\r\ne a good idea to overthink the\n&gt; &gt; junit-concept leading this direction any=\r\nway but I get the feeling its a\n&gt; &gt; little too much for this concern.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; At last I do not think the external switch is a problem as its highly\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; optional. If you use it, you know what you are doing. Dont you think so?\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; [1] https://code.google.com/p/junitparams/\n&gt; &gt; [2] http://johannesl=\r\nink.net/projects/cpsuite.jsp\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; 2013/4/29 Kevin Cooney &lt;kcooney@go=\r\nogle.com&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Henning,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Sorry for the lack of response. JU=\r\nnit is maintained by volunteers, and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; sometimes our day jobs get busy.=\r\n I was waiting for David to respond (I\n&gt; &gt; am a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; sometimes contributor=\r\n) but here are my thoughts.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; This is an interesting idea. Note t=\r\nhat you could get what you want\n&gt; with a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; custom runner.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; M=\r\ny concern with adding Rules via system properties that someone running\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nthe\n&gt; &gt; &gt; tests in their IDE would see different results compared to the te=\r\nst\n&gt; runs\n&gt; &gt; &gt; from Maven. Sure, you could tell your IDE to run the tests =\r\nwith the\n&gt; same\n&gt; &gt; &gt; system properties, but it would be unexpected for mos=\r\nt people to have\n&gt; to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; take a special step to make the tests run the s=\r\name way as they did in\n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; continuous build.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Could you =\r\nfind some way to define the global rules via code? Perhaps\n&gt; you\n&gt; &gt; &gt; coul=\r\nd add a DynamicRule to all of your tests that could apply the\n&gt; &gt; addition\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; rules. Alternatively, you could have a class in the same package as t=\r\nhe\n&gt; &gt; &gt; tests that defined the global rules for tests in that package (tho=\r\nugh\n&gt; I&#39;m\n&gt; &gt; &gt; not sure there is a platform-independent way to scan all of=\r\n the classes\n&gt; &gt; in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; a package that works for all runtime/deployment e=\r\nnvironments)\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; -- Kevin\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; On Mon, Apr 29, 2013 at=\r\n 7:09 AM, Henning Gro=DF &lt;igaffai@...\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; **\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hi!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I have a use-case where I need to =\r\nenable rules based on external\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; parameters.
