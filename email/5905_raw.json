That&#39;s pretty subjective.\n&gt; \n&gt; Ok.  I  can buy that.  Of course I have worked on small to medium\n&gt; projects that tried to incorporate almost every pattern under the\n&gt; sun--many times causing more bulk than necessary.  That is why I\n&gt; termed it &quot;overuse&quot;, although &quot;inappropreate use&quot; applies better.\n\nI&#39;d call that inappropriate.. using patterns for the sake of using\npatterns.. and likely in the contest of BDUF, right?  Have you read\nJoshua Kerievsky&#39;s &quot;Refactoring to Patterns&quot;?  It explores/catalogs\nrefactorings that move you to/toward patterns.\n \n&gt; &gt;&gt;The TestCase is taken, and by reflection is turned into a TestSuite.  So\n&gt; &gt;&gt;is it a TestCase or a TestSuite?  That is an important distinction.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;The Model is not readily apparent.  A stable and predictable model is\n&gt; &gt;&gt;essential to good design--esp. in this case.  I have no problem with\n&gt; &gt;&gt;saying that a TestCollector dynamically creates a TestSuite from a\n&gt; &gt;&gt;collection of TestCases.  That is understandable.  I do have a problem\n&gt; &gt;&gt;with the TestCase being treated as a TestSuite though.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; OK, I&#39;ll try to address this one.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; TestCase is a mechanism to allow fixture reuse.  An instance of a\n&gt; &gt; TestCase builds a fixture, runs a single test, and tears down the\n&gt; &gt; fixture. By allowing TestCase to contain multiple tests (i.e. public\n&gt; &gt; void testXXX() methods) you can share a fixture definition.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Put another way, TestCase is NOT a way to conceptually group tests. \n&gt; &gt; Each TestCase subclass represents a fixture, and contains a group of\n&gt; &gt; tests that run in the context of that fixture. Once you realize this,\n&gt; &gt; you&#39;ll find yourself switching (as I did some time ago) from having a\n&gt; &gt; TestCase for each class you are testing (with a overly generic fixture\n&gt; &gt; of which pieces were used by the different tests) to organizing tests\n&gt; &gt; around the fixtures, with less regard for the classes being tested by\n&gt; &gt; each TestCase.\n&gt; \n&gt; I tend to test interfaces.  As such, with the current implementation of\n&gt; JUinit, I have one Abstract testcase to excersize the interface&#39;s\n&gt; contracts.  I have concrete classes that extend that abstract test case\n&gt; for the individual classes.  If there are specific issues or features\n&gt; of an implementation that need to be tested (i.e. consequences that\n&gt; are outside of the scope of the interface like ensuring temporary files\n&gt; are in the right place) I add new methods to the concrete test to ensure\n&gt; that things are done properly.\n\nThat sounds like a reasonable approach reasonable.  It&#39;s a case of\nextracting commonality to a superclass.  \n\n&gt; As to what you are referring to as a Fixture, I am not exactly sure.\n\nA fixture is the situation in which a test expects to run. \nSpecifically, it&#39;s what setUp() builds.\n\n&gt; &gt; TestSuite is a mechanism for grouping a collection of TestCase instances\n&gt; &gt; and running them sequentially.  So, TestCase has the ability to create a\n&gt; &gt; TestSuite containing all instances of itself (using reflection to create\n&gt; &gt; an instance for each constituent test).  Also, you have the ability to\n&gt; &gt; create explicit TestSuites by subclassing TestSuite and writing a custom\n&gt; &gt; suite() method.  This is useful for collecting together groups of\n&gt; &gt; smaller TestSuites which can be other custom TestSuites, or TestSuites\n&gt; &gt; generated by TestCases.\n&gt; \n&gt; That&#39;s the thing.  The TestSuite, while theorhetically a nice feature,\n&gt; adds too much.  You also run the risk/temptation to write tests that\n&gt; require to be run in a specific order to pass.  If the order is changed,\n&gt; or unpredictable, you have to write more robust tests.\n\nAll tools involve a certain amount of risk and/or temptation.  It&#39;s a\nmatter of using it properly.\n\n&gt; Nine times out of ten, all you really need is a TestCollector.  The\n&gt; collector finds all your tests, and runs them.\n\nVery true. And that&#39;s easy enough to write.  In fact there&#39;s\nRecursiveTestSuite by Mike Bowler (http://gsbase.sourceforge.net) that\ndoes that.\n \n&gt; &gt; Both TestSuite and TestCase implement the Test interface. The\n&gt; &gt; TestRunners work with things that are Tests, hence we can point at any\n&gt; &gt; Test (ie TestSuite or TestCase) and recursively run all the contained\n&gt; &gt; tests.  The internal nodes are TestSuites and the leaves are TestCases.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Yes, but what happens if you don&#39;t want to extend either TestCase or\n&gt; TestSuite?  What happens if you want to access Assert from TestSuite?\n&gt; The contracts are with the *implementations* of the Test interface,\n&gt; and not with the Test interface itself.\n\nYou can always just implement Test and use Assert.  \n \n&gt; &gt; I hope that makes things clearer.\n&gt; \n&gt; What about the other points I had?\n\nI only said I&#39;d address that one :-)\n\nWhy not rewrite JUnit the way you are envisioning and see how it works &\nhow people like it?  Nobody said you *HAVE* to use JUnit.\n\nDave\n-- \nDave Astels (dave@...)\n  Coauthor of &quot;A Practical Guide to XP&quot;\n  Editor of the Test-Driven Development Edition of The Coad Letter\n    (subscribe at www.thecoadletter.com)\nCEO & Master Software Craftsman, Saorsa Development Inc.\nwww.saorsa.com\n&quot;An Agile Software Studio&quot;\n\n\n",
