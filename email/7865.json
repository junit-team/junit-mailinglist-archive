In most cases yes B&#39;s method is trivial so I could<br/>\nstart from the other end and drive my code from the root class&#39;s test.<br/>\nHowever being a newbie(ish) at junit I don&#39;t currently like the idea of<br/>\nstarting from that end as I still have a tendency to &quot;wander off&quot; sometimes<br/>\nwithin my coding (you know how it is...) and by driving from the wrong<br/>\ndirection gives me the freedom to screw up. I guess this is just a<br/>\ndiscipline thing.  BTW I like the idea of mocking in this context - I hadn&#39;t<br/>\n(yet) thought of that.<br/>\n<br/>\nJonathan<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: J. B. Rainsberger [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jbrains@...\">jbrains@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: 25 April 2003 18:22<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [junit] Test and test case dependencies<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen B calls C, is B&#39;s method trivial? See the JUnit FAQ for details on what<br/>\nI mean by that. If B&#39;s method is trivial, then testing B only tests C and<br/>\nnothing else, so I wouldn&#39;t bother writing the test. If B&#39;s method takes<br/>\nparameters and passes them to C, then B&#39;s method still cannot break: only<br/>\nthe methods that call B&#39;s method and C could break, so test those.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would use the same approach for the relationship between A and B.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf B&#39;s method is not trivial, then as soon as you feel the pain of<br/>\nduplicated tests mock the behavior in C that B calls and use that mock<br/>\nbehavior in the test. This allows you to test B in isolation from any<br/>\ndefects in C.<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope this helps.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;So said Jonathan Oddy on 4/25/2003 --------------------<br/>\n&gt;I understand that in general we want to write tests and test cases that are<br/>\n&gt;not dependent upon each other so that an earlier failing(?) test doesn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt;set<br/>\n&gt;state of the underlying object(s) to prejudice later tests.  Okay fine, but<br/>\n&gt;I was wondering how people solve/resolve the following type of dependency.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;If I have three classes A, B and C where A delegates some functionality to<br/>\n&gt;B<br/>\n&gt;which delegates to C.  During my implementation and unit testing I write<br/>\n&gt;tests for C then implement the desired functionality in C.  I then repeat<br/>\n&gt;the process for B and A, okay fine.  But now I have an implied unit test<br/>\n&gt;dependency don&#39;t I?  So when running my tests as a suite I really want my<br/>\n&gt;test cases to run in the order C, B, A and never any other order because if<br/>\n&gt;the defect is in C then I want to know about it from C and not from A or B.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I am currently implementing a small library that does a lot of this style<br/>\n&gt;of<br/>\n&gt;delegation, and being reasonably new to JUnit I wondered how other people<br/>\n&gt;work round this issue especially since those nice Eclipse people provide a<br/>\n&gt;helpful &quot;run all tests in a package option&quot;.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Thanks inadnavce<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Jonathan<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Yahoo!
