I hadn&#39;t\nthought of this and people often forget to mention it. Of course, this has a\ngreat effect on the tools you end up using.\n\nAlso, I agree regarding the combinatorial explosion problem. I had to write\na Lexer for a toy programming language in one of my courses and having a\nunit test for each input pattern helped to narrow down problems so quickly\nthat I finished in ~3 hours!\n\nPeople here at varsity also seldom miss the point about testing scope. They\nseem to assume that every level of testing will always be used, and teach\naccordingly. I think it&#39;s important to note that this is not always\nneccessary.\n\nThanks for the distinction you made between integration tests and larger\nscale ones. I think I understand a little better where the boundaries lie :)\n\n2008/9/4 lancezant &lt;lancezant@...&gt;\n\n&gt;   Hi Jan,\n&gt;\n&gt; I agree, and as you touch on the idea of acceptance tests, you come\n&gt; close to the one point I&#39;d add. Besides running time and number of\n&gt; failures, the other distinguishing feature of acceptance tests is that\n&gt; the interacts often cross the system&#39;s boundary. By that I mean input\n&gt; comes through non-java interfaces such as GUIs, message systems, etc.\n&gt; and output involve more side effects (i.e. go to places other than\n&gt; back to the source). In some cases, these can be shoehorned into a\n&gt; Java interface (e.g. httpunit) but this is often where the need for\n&gt; other tools comes in.\n&gt;\n&gt; The reason for fine-grained testing is that large-grained tests are\n&gt; overwhelmed by combinatoric explosion of conditions long before they\n&gt; achieve reasonable coverage. The &quot;unit&quot; is usually a single class.\n&gt; The system can be tens to thousands of classes. For small systems,\n&gt; the gap may be small enough that unit and acceptance tests are\n&gt; sufficient.\n&gt;\n&gt; Often, however, it is useful to have integration tests in between. By\n&gt; testing clusters of collaborating classes, integration tests can\n&gt; further reduce the number of acceptance tests needed to achieve\n&gt; reasonable coverage. The thing integration tests have in common with\n&gt; unit tests is that by being entirely within the system boundary, they\n&gt; can reuse much of the Java infrastructure, including JUnit, mock\n&gt; objects, etc.\n&gt;\n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Lance\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In junit@yahoogroups.com &lt;junit%40yahoogroups.com&gt;, &quot;Jan Kroeze&quot;\n&gt; &lt;thejcwk@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Hi!\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I think this summarises quite neatly what a couple of people have\n&gt; said,\n&gt; &gt; namely that switching to a dedicated framework from JUnit is only\n&gt; neccessary\n&gt; &gt; if there are quite a few / complicated integration tests.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I happen to agree with this, since introducing more and more\n&gt; frameworks into\n&gt; &gt; your project just for testing will certainly drive many programmers\n&gt; up the\n&gt; &gt; walls. You have to be certain the cost is worth the pay off :) Yet,\n&gt; &gt; especially with user acceptance testing, I have to side with going\n&gt; with a\n&gt; &gt; new framework, if simply for the reason that the client should be\n&gt; able to\n&gt; &gt; read them.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; 2008/9/3 kentb &lt;kentb@...&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Jan,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; You can use JUnit for longer-running tests, but there are some\n&gt; assumptions\n&gt; &gt; &gt; JUnit embodies that will cause some problems. JUnit assumes tests\n&gt; are\n&gt; &gt; &gt; atomic--they run or don&#39;t run, they run in unit time. Integration\n&gt; tests\n&gt; &gt; &gt; often take a long time to run, so interim feedback is valuable.\n&gt; Integration\n&gt; &gt; &gt; tests can usefully have multiple failures, where that is less\n&gt; common with\n&gt; &gt; &gt; unit tests. OTOH, tests are tests--independent self-checking bits\n&gt; of code\n&gt; &gt; &gt; that run and get reported--and for that part of running\n&gt; integration tests\n&gt; &gt; &gt; JUnit works fine.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; It seems to me to be a tradeoff between the simplicity of running\n&gt; all tests\n&gt; &gt; &gt; as JUnit tests and the challenges of getting the integration tests\n&gt; to run\n&gt; &gt; &gt; as\n&gt; &gt; &gt; JUnit tests. Different contexts will requires different solutions.\n&gt; If I had\n&gt; &gt; &gt; a few integration tests, I&#39;d make them work with JUnit. If I had a\n&gt; large\n&gt; &gt; &gt; suite of integration tests that played a prominent role in\n&gt; development, I\n&gt; &gt; &gt; would use some other tool and integrate my unit testing results\n&gt; with the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; integration results.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Regards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Kent Beck\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Three Rivers Institute\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; _____\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; From: junit@yahoogroups.com &lt;junit%40yahoogroups.com&gt; &lt;junit%\n&gt; 40yahoogroups.com&gt; [mailto:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; junit@yahoogroups.com &lt;junit%40yahoogroups.com&gt; &lt;junit%\n&gt; 40yahoogroups.com&gt;] On Behalf Of Jan\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Kroeze\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Sent: Tuesday, September 02, 2008 1:05 AM\n&gt; &gt; &gt; To: junit@yahoogroups.com &lt;junit%40yahoogroups.com&gt; &lt;junit%\n&gt; 40yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Subject: [junit] JUnit And Larger Scale Tests\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Hi all!\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I&#39;m a bit of a newb to the whole TDD thing, but I understand that\n&gt; unit\n&gt; &gt; &gt; tests\n&gt; &gt; &gt; are supposed to be blazingly fast and not access the hard drive,\n&gt; network,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; database or anything external to the code itself. To this end, I\n&gt; understand\n&gt; &gt; &gt; that a framework such as jMock can be used.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; So far, so good. But I find JUnit to be extremely useful for\n&gt; writing\n&gt; &gt; &gt; integration, system and user acceptance tests as well.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Here&#39;s my question: what is the official position of the JUnit\n&gt; community on\n&gt; &gt; &gt; using JUnit to do larger scale tests? Is there a better framework,\n&gt; or is it\n&gt; &gt; &gt; common practice to use JUnit for these tests as well?\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; --\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Jan Kroeze\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; --\n&gt; &gt; Jan Kroeze\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\n\n\n-- \nJan Kroeze\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n",
