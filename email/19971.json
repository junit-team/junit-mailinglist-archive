The problem is a<br/>\nClassCastException in BaseTestRunner when loading our suite class.  In<br/>\nJUnit 3, it didn&#39;t matter what type of class was loaded as long as it<br/>\nhad a static suite() method with no arguments.  But now in JUnit 4,<br/>\nthe class must extend TestCase.  I don&#39;t understand why this is<br/>\nnecessary - the getTest() method returns the Test interface and<br/>\ninternally it still uses reflection to get the static suite() method.<br/>\n So why does the code cast the Class to a TestCase?  It seems like<br/>\nthis is a case of overzealous use of the new parameterized types in<br/>\nJava 5 and a regression from JUnit 3.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, in JUnit 3 the method loadSuiteClass() called getLoader() to get<br/>\nthe ClassLoader to use, which opened the door for extensibility.  This<br/>\nis gone now, why?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks in advance...</div>",
