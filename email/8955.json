Just &#39;cos it isn&#39;t proven,<br/>\n&gt;doesn&#39;t make it not right. Why not accept good fortune occasionally?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;      &gt; I write code, I test my code, I debug my code when tests fail<br/>\n&gt;      &gt; by trying to analyse the output. I was hoping for it to be<br/>\n&gt;      &gt; easier to analyse, w/o a lot of manual effort, but I don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt;      &gt; have an itch big enough to attempt to write such a tool --<br/>\n&gt;      &gt; especially when it&#39;d be cheap/clean to do it in the<br/>\n&gt;      &gt; framework.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;      So you are actually concerned about who will be writing the code to<br/>\n&gt;make<br/>\n&gt;&gt;      it work?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I have open source projects I help out with, I think the bigger test is the<br/>\n&gt;community of folk you work with. If I am this out of synch with you all it<br/>\n&gt;isn&#39;t a good start. There are many reason why software projects fail, and I<br/>\n&gt;don&#39;t need to start one that appears so unwelcomed by the development team<br/>\n&gt;for the product (that I like/use so much) that I was hoping to assist  w/<br/>\n&gt;&quot;my little epiphany&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Adam, please read more closely. This is the second time that you have distorted what we have written.<br/>\n<br/>\nYour idea is not unwelcome. I have stated -- a few times -- that what you propose (the ability to manage dependencies of the sort you describe) is a good idea and would likely be welcome to others. All I have said is that I do not believe it belongs at the core of JUnit.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for hoping that the JUnit team will assist you, I guess you don&#39;t know the JUnit team very well. Kent and Erich are nice folks, but they are not active contributors to JUnit these days. Just look at the gulfs in time between releases to convince yourself. Kent and Erich are not going to jump on board and help you with this. They don&#39;t have the time or energy. The real activity is in add-on projects like JUnit-addons.<br/>\n<br/>\nJUnit is an excellent example of a well-closed package -- not perfect, but pretty damn good -- so that the vast majority of new features can be implemented easily enough by adding onto JUnit rather than changing its core. I think this is a testament to JUnit&#39;s design. The majority of extensions/changes fall into three categories:<br/>\n<br/>\n* Customized assertions<br/>\n* Custom Test Runners<br/>\n* Custom classes to sit at the root of a TestCase hierarchy<br/>\n<br/>\nHTMLUnit is an example of the first. Artima&#39;s suite runner is an example of the second. StrutsTestCase is an example of the third.<br/>\n<br/>\nA good solution to your problem is the second: a custom test runner with a dependency graph collector/analyzer.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;      &gt; Also, much as I could craft some sort of add on<br/>\n&gt;      &gt; (perhaps leverage my own sub-class from TestCase) I think it<br/>\n&gt;      &gt; needs too much of what is in the framework in order to work<br/>\n&gt;      &gt; well, and I don&#39;t fancy re-writing the thing.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;      I don&#39;t think you&#39;d need to rewrite anything.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;But I do, and if I am writing it that matters more. Few people here have<br/>\n&gt;even accepted the need for the concept, and other than &quot;go write you own<br/>\n&gt;collectors&quot; not offered help, so why would I waste time on the<br/>\n&gt;implementation?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Excuse me: did you expect that we would suspend our lives and help you write what you need? That&#39;s not how open source works. I didn&#39;t see you handing out invitations; but rather asking, &quot;Why don&#39;t you people add this to JUnit?&quot; That we don&#39;t need, thanks.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;      &gt; I use eclipse, I use ant -- I like the integration into those<br/>\n&gt;      &gt; tools more than I like my idea. If I can&#39;t get you to<br/>\n&gt;      &gt; contemplate the concept, then I probably have little chance<br/>\n&gt;      &gt; of persuading them. If they don&#39;t use it, I won&#39;t benefit. Another<br/>\n&gt;      &gt; reason not to start.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;      You wouldn&#39;t need to persuade anyone. Both Eclipse and Ant are open<br/>\n&gt;      source and have a quite mature plugin concept.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Yes, I know, I&#39;ve written for both. I&#39;m hardly going to try to replicate<br/>\n&gt;all<br/>\n&gt;the work for both plugins just to try to get this point over.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Then I guess you don&#39;t need it that badly.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;      &gt; This was my first topic on this mailing list, and much as you<br/>\n&gt;      &gt; were pretty measured/polite (at least at the start) I don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt;      &gt; think I&#39;ll be back for more. Open Source is (IMHO) about open<br/>\n&gt;      &gt; minded discussion of ideas, and I don&#39;t think I found that<br/>\n&gt;      &gt; here. No worries, have fun w/ what you do.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;      It is also about contribution. I think we would all be pleased to<br/>\n&gt;see<br/>\n&gt;&gt;      you write your tool and happy to help you where we can. If it<br/>\n&gt;proves to<br/>\n&gt;&gt;      be valuable to many people, the best way to distribute it could be<br/>\n&gt;&gt;      reconsidered.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Sorry, I&#39;ve heard that too many times before. Sure, it is a filter of who<br/>\n&gt;wants to put skin in the game, but it can also be used as an easy barrier.<br/>\n&gt;Yes, I know it is &quot;part of OSS the process -- the trial by code<br/>\n&gt;production&quot;,<br/>\n&gt;but it doesn&#39;t make it always right & I am not sure it is right here.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;If the community of developers/users on a project isn&#39;t open to accepting a<br/>\n&gt;core change [and I feel that is the default reaction here -- right or<br/>\n&gt;wrong]<br/>\n&gt;then it doesn&#39;t making it a welcoming environment to want to invest to much<br/>\n&gt;effort. As such, what could be done as an internal change gets relegated to<br/>\n&gt;a large external development. Sorry, as I&#39;ve stated before -- I wanted to<br/>\n&gt;clean up some ugly reporting mess, not re-write a testing tool.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You conclude that the community of developers is not open to accepting a core change.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe alternate conclusion is that the community of developers does not believe your particular proposed change is a good idea.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn what basis did you choose your conclusion over the alternative?<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen you are ready to accept the possibility that we merely disagree with you, rather than are nefariously blocking your proposal, please come back and discuss this with us again.<br/>\n<br/>\n(Incidentally, I don&#39;t see how we can block your proposal, anyway. We don&#39;t own JUnit.)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nJ. B.
