However, we also have test code<br/>\nthat is not using JUnit in the /test tree. Eclipse doesn&#39;t care, but<br/>\nrunning the tests using Ant with batchtest generates exceptions for all<br/>\nthe classes not using JUnit. We don&#39;t want to have the failures in the<br/>\ntest results, but also don&#39;t want to store test code in /src.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat is the best practice in this situation?
