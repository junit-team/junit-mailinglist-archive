    "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1732476294\">JBR,<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter playing around with it a bit more, there is one more reason to <br/>\nlike the inner class configuration. While using the junit and <br/>\njunitreport tasks in ant I found that you can control whether the <br/>\ntests show up as different line items in the report, or all as part <br/>\nof the parent. In this way, you junit reports generated by ant can <br/>\nbe truly &quot;class-based&quot;. For those familiar with ant, I use the <br/>\nbatchtest task to select my test cases based on the class name. All <br/>\nclasses that end in &quot;Test.class&quot; get run. Therefore, if my inner <br/>\nclass name ends in Test then in the report you get <br/>\nOuterClassTest$InnerTest (establishing a hierarchy in the test <br/>\nlisting. Otherwise, you can have all of the test methods appear <br/>\nunder the single OuterClassTest entry by naming the inner classes <br/>\nsomething else. Pretty handy...<br/>\n<br/>\nRegards,<br/>\n<br/>\nJosh<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Tharp, Joshua L, SOLGV&quot; <br/>\n&lt;jltharp@a...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; [JBR]<br/>\n&gt; ...Agreed, and so using nested classes for related fixtures is not <br/>\n </span></blockquote>a bad<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; idea at all.
