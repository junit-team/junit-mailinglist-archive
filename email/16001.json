(Re: <br/>\n&gt; [junit] Re: Observations from a production use of JUnit4)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Jason Rogers wrote:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; My point was that instead of using string-based reflection, <br/>\n&gt; you have a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; collection of Adaptors that you can iterate over to get the same<br/>\n&gt; &gt; behavior.  How do you get the adaptors?  Use a Factory.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I get it; I really do. I&#39;d like to frame my original question <br/>\n&gt; within the <br/>\n&gt; context of JUnit itself, and not just to bring this back <br/>\n&gt; on-topic.[1] A <br/>\n&gt; common way to extract test methods from JUnit (3.x) tests is to use a <br/>\n&gt; naming convention with reflection. Assume that we do not have <br/>\n&gt; access to <br/>\n&gt; metainformation such as annotations. How could we allow <br/>\n&gt; people to write <br/>\n&gt; tests without having to do the kind of double-entry I prefer <br/>\n&gt; not to do? <br/>\n&gt; In other words, I just want to write a test and JUnit knows <br/>\n&gt; it&#39;s a test, <br/>\n&gt; rather than having to tell it that. How can we do that without <br/>\n&gt; reflection? If there&#39;s a way, I want to know about it, because I&#39;d be <br/>\n&gt; missing something valuable!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; What I find strange in all this is that I demonstrated doing <br/>\n&gt; what JUnit <br/>\n&gt; does in another piece of code, and even people who use JUnit <br/>\n&gt; looked at <br/>\n&gt; me like I was high.[2] Why the double standard? Why does JUnit get to <br/>\n&gt; use this pattern and I don&#39;t. It&#39;s just weird, so I&#39;m looking for an <br/>\n&gt; explanation by asking the more general question, &quot;What&#39;s so bad about <br/>\n&gt; Pluggable Selector?&quot;<br/>\n&gt; ----<br/>\n&gt; [1] Personally I don&#39;t care whether it&#39;s off- or on-topic, but some <br/>\n&gt; readers might care.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; [2] Just say no.
