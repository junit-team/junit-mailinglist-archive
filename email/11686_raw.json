I&#39;d be interested how you use functionality tests (in addition to\n&gt; unit tests?) and wether anyone knows any tools that are better suited for\n&gt; this kind of job than JUnit.\n\nWell, Michael Feathers has written a fair amount about testing legacy \ncode (code without tests). You might like to hunt down what he writes \nabout that.\n\nMy codebase rescue approach these days is two-pronged:\n\n1. Work with the people who know what the system is supposed to do, then \nwrite acceptance tests that capture that knowledge. I often do this with \nFit/FitNesse.\n\n2. Write only the object tests I need to enable the refactoring \n/required/ by fixing a defect or adding a feature. It would be nice to \nrefactor for its own sake, but I can&#39;t prove that that delivers value. I \n/can/ prove that refactoring for 30 minutes saved me an hour adding a \nfeature, so it was worth doing.\n\nAs for tools, I do heavily data-driven testing as well as acceptance \ntesting with Fit, and I do object-level behavior testing with JUnit. If \nyou don&#39;t know Fit, and JUnit is working for you, then keep using JUnit \nuntil you have a spare moment to experiment with Fit. :)\n-- \nJ. B.
