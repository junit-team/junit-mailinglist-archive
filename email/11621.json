A little scary at first, <br/>\nbut likely not too difficult. Note that once() and exactly() are merely <br/>\nconvenience methods to make the syntax easier on the eyes. They just <br/>\ncreate InvocationMatcher objects (or whatever they really are) that <br/>\nmatch the number of invocations on verify().<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJ. B.
