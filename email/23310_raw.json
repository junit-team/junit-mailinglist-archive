I tagged\nthe rest with:\n- regression bugs (9): there was an implementation of the feature that\nworked prior to the 4.9 beta (although potentially earlier than\n4.8.x))\n- nonregression bugs (15): it is likely the feature has always failed\nin the documented way.\n- features (~95): additions to the (implicit) spec, with\nimplementations to provide the additions.\n\nThanks to everyone who has been submitting problems, proposals, and\npatches.  I&#39;m sorry that some of you have been waiting so long for a\nresponse.\n\nThe next part of the development plan, in order:\n\n- Fix the regression bugs\n- Release a 4.9 beta 3\n- Hopefully 4.9b3 can become the final release.  (I am not planning\nany nonregression bug fixes or new features to get into the 4.9\nrelease.  We need to steer this ship back toward frequent releases.)\n- Create a github project for junit.contrib.\n- Go through the backlog of pull requests, to see which can be\naccepted as is, and which either need changes, or should be redirected\ninto junit.contrib.\n- Work through non-regression bugs for further releases in the 4.9.x series\n- Choose a number of highly-rated feature requests to be the scope for\n4.10, and begin (patch acceptance / implementation)\n\nI&#39;m excited to see this project keep moving forward,\n\n   David Saff\n\n",
