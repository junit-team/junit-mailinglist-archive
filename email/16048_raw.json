But for web\napplication development, where HTML/javascript would be root cause of lots\nof bugs, Junit is not so powerful. Any comments ? \n\nI&#39;ve used the following at one point or another, and they are all pretty\ndecent:\n\nhttp://jwebunit.sourceforge.net/\nOr\nhttp://webtest.canoo.com/webtest/manual/WebTestHome.html\n\nWhich are both based on\n\nhttp://httpunit.sourceforge.net/\nAnd  \t\nhttp://htmlunit.sourceforge.net/\nRespectively.\n\nAn automated Webtesting is essential for regression testing releases. Unless\nyou can afford to pay a group of testers to check the same tasks every time\nyou release a piece of software.\n\nIn enterprise applications, you&#39;ll save man months with an automated\nWeb-based Unit test regression test.\n\nThis page lists quite a few options for testing software:\n\nhttp://www.softwareqatest.com/qatweb1.html\n\nFinally, (and possibly a little OT) to add to this thread, I&#39;d be very\ninterested in anyone&#39;s opinion on these though (Hope you don&#39;t mind this\nhijack Frank but I think its relevant!) these are the Click your way through\na series of web pages to perform &quot;something&quot; and it will be repeated for you\nby software, good for an End to End approach to testing.\n\nNot sure if it can still be classed as Unit testing though, so apologies in\nadvance if this is OT.\n\nhttp://www.crimsonsolutions.co.uk/testing/testing-downloads.php\nhttp://www.pushtotest.com/Downloads/features.html\n\nAgain, apologies if this is OT, and J.B. thanks for the JUnit Recipes book\n:)\nCheers,\nOisin\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: junit@yahoogroups.com [mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com] On Behalf Of\nfrank zou\nSent: 09 February 2006 13:41\nTo: junit@yahoogroups.com\nSubject: [junit] Is Junit-based testing REALLY possible for commercial\nsoftware development ?\n\n\nHi all,\n\nAfter lots of reading and trying, I think I understand the following\nbenefits that Junit-base testing can give us:\n\n* more robust system\n* clean / good design\n* less regression bugs\n* confidence to do refactorying, especially at the later phase of the\nproject. \n* and lots more...\n\nThese are really good things, for open-source projects where there is no\ndeadline pressure and resource could almost be thought as un-limitted.\nHowever, for commercial software development, is this still possible ?\n\n\nAlthough I knew JUnit and other JUnit-based open-source tools for a couple\nof years, my company and team never really enbrace it. The major reason is\nProduct Managers always want to add cool features to the system quickly\nwhile programmers find the schedule is always too tight to spend any extra\ntime to write testing. \n\nI know from the mail list and books that we can take lots of advantage of\nJUnit-based testing, I myself have no real hands-on experience on it. So\nhere are my questions: \n\n* Will Junit-based testing make the project time longer or shorter ?\nAny hard statistic data ? ( Here I mean commercial project rather than\nopen-source project. )\n\n* One intersting point I found is that after Junit-based testing is\nintroduced, programmers tend to use IDE debugger much less than before.\nThis would save lots of time. Is that true ?\n\n* Some guys say JUnit is good for biz / util code testing. But for web\napplication development, where HTML/javascript would be root cause of lots\nof bugs, Junit is not so powerful. Any comments ? \n\n* How can I convince managers and programmers that JUnit-based is really\npossible for commercial software development ? Any differnece from\nopen-source projects ?\n\n\n \nCan some Junit gurus shed some light here ?\n\nThanks,\n- Frank\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nYahoo! Groups Links\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
