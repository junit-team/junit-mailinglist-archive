Basically its my job to navigate many of the potential <br/>\n&gt;problems.  Anyhow the problem I had when beginning with junit was I found <br/>\n&gt;that a lot of the documentaion had holes in it.  So I&#39;ve attached here a <br/>\n&gt;document which describes how to write your first junit test (it assumes <br/>\n&gt;junit is already installed).  Maybe you will find it useful, and any <br/>\n&gt;feedback would be appreciated, Nic.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Points:<br/>\n* What coding conventions do you use at your company?
