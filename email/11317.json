Rainsberger [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jbrains@...\">jbrains@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: mercredi 30 juin 2004 03:32<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: [junit] Re: Help with MockObjects<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; cliftonccraig wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Yes, It was in the JUnit In Action book where I saw the practice of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; using tearDown for calls to the verify on the mockobjects. It&#39;s right<br/>\n&gt; &gt; there in chapter 8 page 168. Now they are using mocks from the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; easymock.org framework but I don&#39;t think that makes much of a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; difference. Maybe their examples were based on an earlier version of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; JUnit where this wasn&#39;t a problem?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I love Vince Massol. I think he&#39;s brilliant. In this one design/coding<br/>\n&gt; choice, I disagree with him.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>What&#39;s wrong with that?

It has always worked for me with either easymock or<br/>\ndynamocks.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat it is now automatic in jmock is of course much better.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks<br/>\n-Vincent</div>",
