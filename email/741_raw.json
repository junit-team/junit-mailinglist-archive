This happens because the classes were \noriginally developed without Unit Testing in mind.  For a class to be \neasy to test, it needs to follow good Object Oriented Design \npractices where the class is well encapsulated and has little \ncoupling with other classes.\n\n[Note:  I&#39;ve also seen Unit Testing improve the design.  Making the \nclasses testable makes for better encapsulation and lower coupling]\n\nPutting Unit Tests on existing code can get very ugly.  Some classes \nmay not be worth Unit Testing until they are first refactored into \nsomething more easily tested.  This refactoring is beneficial but \ncostly.  You will have to make the cost-benefit determination to see \nif you should Unit Test the difficult code, refactor it, defer it.\n\n\n\n",
