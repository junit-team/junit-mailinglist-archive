They both have ant scripts to run the tests<br/>\nso that should get you easily started on where to find the tests etc. Good<br/>\nluck.<br/>\n<br/>\n-T<br/>\n<br/>\n2006/2/17, Kamal Ahmed &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:KAhmed@...\">KAhmed@...</a>&gt;:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; Teemu,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Could you please send me the URL, where I can find these test cases for<br/>\n&gt; Spring and Velocity<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thanks,<br/>\n&gt; -Kamal.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a>] On Behalf Of<br/>\n&gt; teemu kanstren<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Friday, February 17, 2006 3:54 PM<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: [junit] which open-source project(s) could be used as example<br/>\n&gt; of learning testing ?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; For research purposes I have gathered data on a bunch of OSS projects and<br/>\n&gt; their JUnit tests. I never ran appfuse but I guess I should give it a go<br/>\n&gt; if<br/>\n&gt; it has good testing. What I did notice is Spring had something around<br/>\n&gt; 3000+<br/>\n&gt; tests that varied from testing 0 classes to testing 100+ classes so I<br/>\n&gt; guess<br/>\n&gt; you got a lot of different tests to look at there. Then ant also has 1000+<br/>\n&gt; tests and so on. Most I ran had around 500+ and for example velocity I<br/>\n&gt; think<br/>\n&gt; was around 50 or so. Spring also runs those tests relatively fast and good<br/>\n&gt; with little effort needed from someone who doesnt know it (that is not too<br/>\n&gt; tricky db setups etc) so I guess its ok. But I think it all depends on you<br/>\n&gt; definition of best practices and stuff. I dont think its too simple but I<br/>\n&gt; guess it might be im just too complicated myself :o. Also for learning<br/>\n&gt; purposes it depends who is doing the learning, in what context and with<br/>\n&gt; what<br/>\n&gt; background and lots of other stuff. If you can define what you want to see<br/>\n&gt; in it maybe it will be easier to suggest something.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ps since you all are going to ask what an earth is a test that tests 0<br/>\n&gt; classes, well according to the source comments it is an empty test case<br/>\n&gt; needed to make eclipse test runner run some tests created using<br/>\n&gt; inheritance<br/>\n&gt; hierarchies and so on...:)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -t<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 2006/2/15, frank zou &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:frankz1998@...\">frankz1998@...</a>&gt;:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Hi all,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Lots of open-source projects are using TDD/Unit Testing. Do you have<br/>\n&gt; &gt; any ideas of which project(s) could be used to learn the &quot;BEST<br/>\n&gt; &gt; PRACTICES&quot; of using Unit Testing ?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; e.g, someone said &quot;AppFuse&quot; is cool for this purpose.
