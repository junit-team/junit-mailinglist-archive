I&#39;ve found that the best way to learn is to write something<br/>\n&gt; myself.  I think of something that I&#39;ve been interested in doing lately,<br/>\n&gt; and write some code in that direction, such as a digital jukebox, a<br/>\n&gt; custom news aggregator, or a screensaver.  I&#39;m not intending to finish<br/>\n&gt; the job, but it helps me write code that I understand, since JUnit is<br/>\n&gt; the thing I&#39;m trying to learn.  If I try to learn using someone else&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; code, then I&#39;m never sure if problems are coming from JUnit or the other<br/>\n&gt; code.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Not only that, but once you have a little experience with JUnit, google<br/>\n&gt; for &quot;test-driven development&quot;.  That&#39;s fun stuff.  Good luck,<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Absolutely but sometimes it really helps to have a good example to get you<br/>\nstarted and explain the best style. For instance in eclipse they have a<br/>\nfairly sophisticated test runner that goes and finds all the tests in<br/>\nplugin/package/class and runs them so you don&#39;t need hard to maintain<br/>\nsuites.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat said I don&#39;t know what project to recommend Sreedhar that will do a<br/>\ngood job of illustrating current JUnit best practices in Eclipse. Where&#39;s JB<br/>\nwhen you need him :-)?<br/>\n<br/>\nMark<br/>\n----------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nBlog: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://dotnetjunkies.com/WebLog/mlevison/\">http://dotnetjunkies.com/WebLog/mlevison/</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",
