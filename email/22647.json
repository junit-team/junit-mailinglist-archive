One<br/>\n&gt; thing that would help is clear consensus on community opinion.  There<br/>\n&gt; are currently two different patches mentioned in that thread--would<br/>\n&gt; you be willing to make a case about which is the better solution?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Thankyou, this I can usefully do.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlistair Israel&#39;s patch is a straightforward propagation of the existing<br/>\nconcepts of MethodRules to class level.<br/>\n<br/>\nDaniel Brolund&#39;s patch picks the terminology of &quot;TestCaseRule&quot; for this<br/>\nfeature, which I find less appropriate than &quot;ClassRule&quot; given that tests<br/>\ncan be ordinary classes now rather than inheriting from<br/>\njunit.framework.TestCase. It also goes considerably further, extending<br/>\nthe concept of rules beyond classes, to suites, and adding the concept<br/>\nof propagating rules from suites to individual classes and methods.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the parts where the two overlap, I believe Alistair Israel&#39;s to be<br/>\nslightly superior in the minor details:<br/>\n<br/>\n * Passes an org.junit.runners.model.TestClass to its class-level<br/>\n   rules, not just a java.lang.Class.<br/>\n<br/>\n * Validates that ClassRule fields must be static.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn other respects, it seems to me that Daniel Brolund&#39;s work is close to<br/>\nbeing a superset of Alistair Israel&#39;s.<br/>\n<br/>\nTherefore, I propose that what should happen is:<br/>\n<br/>\n * Review/merge Alistair Israel&#39;s work, and declare issue 29 fixed.<br/>\n<br/>\n * Invite Daniel Brolund to tweak his extended work to be based upon<br/>\n   the merged implementation (which should be an easy task, given how<br/>\n   close conceptually the overlap is), and to open a new issue and<br/>\n   discussion on this mailing list concerning it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\nMax.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",
