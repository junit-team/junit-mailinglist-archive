(I had to think about <br/>\nthat carefully before I typed it.)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe bottom line is that I know I go much, much faster when I have tests <br/>\ncompared to when I don&#39;t. Exactly how much is not something I can say.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; But to my feeling unit testing can be done at the requirements level.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I think you mean what the community calls &quot;story testing&quot;. You&#39;re <br/>\nabsolutely right: you can write tests at that level, and many do. I have <br/>\ntried living with tests /only/ at that level, and invariably find myself <br/>\nwanting to write object-level tests as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nTake care.<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJ. B.
