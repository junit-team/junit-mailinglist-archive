A decent editor like ultraedit will\n&gt; do all your regex will, and a lot more safely...\n\nThe &quot;safe&quot; way to do it would be to save the files in version control\nfirst.  :}  But sadly, i doubt half the industry has even heard of\nversion control, much less uses it effectively.  The find | xargs perl\nregex approach is as safe as any mechanism that doesn&#39;t provide visual\nconfirmation of every edit, and it&#39;s far faster if the number of files\nis substantial.  Of course, the same thing could be done on a\nfile-by-file basis in emacs, vi, or any other real programmer&#39;s editor. \nBut i&#39;ll bet even fewer programmers are using professional-grade editors\nthan are using version control.  At best, they use whatever\npoint-and-drool junk is included with their IDE.  At worst, they use\nNotepad.\n\nSorry about that little rant.  I guess i&#39;m just bitter at the sorry\nstate of affairs in my industry, and the widespread ignorance of basic\ntools and programming techniques like version control, decent editors,\nand regular expressions (not to mention unit testing!).  Far too often,\ni see programmers trying to press a nail into a board with their bare\nhands, and complaining that their hand hurts.\n\n&gt; And congratulations on writing the first entry ;)\n\nMaybe if i&#39;m feeling ambitious i&#39;ll write a few more.  :}\n-- \n\nDavid Stagner\n\nNational Marrow Donor Program\n3001 Broadway Street NE\nBroadway Ridge Suite 500\nMinneapolis, MN  55413\n\nEmail: dstagner@...\n\n",
