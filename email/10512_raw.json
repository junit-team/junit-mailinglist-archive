Initially I was sceptical, but am\nbecoming sold on it. This is one consideration which is bothering me.\n\nLet me hastily insert a newbie warning here - I have _not_ read all\nthe documentation, nor have I tried and understood even all the\nchoices available when creating testcases and testsuites. However, I\nam finding useful benefit from JUnit so far and I&#39;m motivated to take\nit further. To some extent, I&#39;m beating a path for others in my team.\n\nJava is write-once-run-anywhere - right? However, some of us need to\ntest platform specific behaviour, for example, classes that only run\nin Windows or some other environment.\n\nHas anyone written up or done any work with JUnit in this area?\n\nAt the moment, I&#39;m envisaging something in a testcase/testsuite\nsetUp() method where I have some means of checking the the test code\nis being run in the correct environment - this may mean checking\nsystem properties or some external property such as environment\nvariables. If the environment isn&#39;t what I need for the tests to be\nvalid, then I want JUnit to accept a special fail() which says to\nJUnit - don&#39;t run _any_ of the tests in this testcase/testsuite.\n\nThere&#39;s no point in running them because they won&#39;t be valid tests in\nthe incorrect environment, so I don&#39;t want to see a whole bunch of\nfails because they shouldn&#39;t have been run.\n\nThanks if you read this far.\n\n\n\n",
