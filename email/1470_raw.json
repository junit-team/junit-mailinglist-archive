Even the high level functional methods or methods within a public API require a unit test case.\n\nFrom the QA perspective, the methods within the public API are the functional methods and these methods require a\nfunctional test written by the QA team.  This means that there is double coverage on testing the methods in the public\nAPI and developers are not simply checking themselves.\n\nThe next level of testing involves system integration and load testing.\n\nDoes anyone know of a good product for system level testing, especially load testing a server app.\n\nWe have a public API running on a Java application server which we are hitting through JSP pages.  We would like to hit\nthe methods of the public API directly in some sort of multi-threaded heavy load stress simulation.\n\nDoes anyone have any suggestions?\n\nThank you for your consideration.\n\nMike\n\n\n\nVladimir Bossicard wrote:\n\n&gt; If you test classes, you write unit tests.\n&gt; If you test subsystems, you write black-box or white-box tests (or\n&gt; integration tests).\n&gt;\n&gt; The main goal of JUnit is to write unit tests.  Although JUnit can be\n&gt; used to write integration tests, it is not its main goal.  With JUnit,\n&gt; you have problems if you want to test the user interaction or really\n&gt; complexe systems (-&gt; use of mock objects).\n&gt;\n&gt; But I agree, the borderline between unit and integration tests can be\n&gt; really thin (when does an unit really stop?).\n&gt;\n&gt; A developer should be able to test what he&#39;s writing (in X-programming,\n&gt; test code is written before the production code).  If you have two\n&gt; separate packages for the test and the production code, the programmer\n&gt; _cannot_ test everything (his protected methods).  If the developer\n&gt; feels more confident if he writes tests to validate his work: fine!\n&gt;\n&gt; If you want to test a subsystem (the public interface), someone\n&gt; (normally the QA - the developer should not validate his work) has to\n&gt; write another set of tests in another package (and not in the same\n&gt; package of course).\n&gt;\n&gt; In resume:  my unit tests are placed in the same package and my\n&gt; white-box tests in another one.\n&gt;\n&gt; My 2c\n&gt;\n&gt; -Vladimir\n&gt;\n&gt; --\n&gt; Neu: sunrise hat jetzt noch g�nstigere Surfpreise!\n&gt; Sofort profitieren!  http://go.sunrise.ch/de/promo1\n&gt;\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
