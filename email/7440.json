It can provide many benefits and by the same time not<br/>\n&gt; having all the side effects that JUnit and TDD have. Examples are<br/>\n&gt; Eiffel and Java Modelling Language (JML).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Why? How? I&#39;ll explain.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Testing of the code (methods) can be done with precondition,<br/>\n&gt; invartiants and postconditions (the contracts). Thats how I<br/>\n&gt; understand Design by Contract. You write your method definition and<br/>\n&gt; then you write the contract for it. Then you implement your method.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Now the great thing: When you compile your code the implementation<br/>\n&gt; can be checked whether it obeys the contract. If not, a compile error<br/>\n&gt; is thrown. That it! No JUnit test needed! Not TDD needed! Besides<br/>\n&gt; this, a contract serves as a documentation. And it can use invariants<br/>\n&gt; which JUnit will always lack of.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>That would be great if it worked. Unfortunately, the compiler, even in  <br/>\na language like Eiffel, can only detect constraint violations at  <br/>\ncompile time in the simplest of cases. A design-by-contract language  <br/>\njust inserts run-time checks the rest of the time. The run-time checks  <br/>\nonly work if all the code is actually executed. If a method is not run  <br/>\nin testing, the check will never have a chance to fail before it gets  <br/>\nin the hands of users. This leaves you with either trying to run the  <br/>\napplication manually and try *everything* or find a way to automate the  <br/>\ntest process. This in turn leads to something like JUnit.<br/>\n<br/>\nAn additional problem with design-by-contract is that general-purpose  <br/>\npostcondition checks are difficult to write. With a non-trivial method,  <br/>\nthe postcondition code must often either be as complex as the method  <br/>\nitself (and therefore at least as likely to have errors) or must depend  <br/>\non the same underlying code as the method (I see people cut and paste  <br/>\noften). Writing an external test-case is often much easier by  <br/>\ncomparison. You can choose inputs for which the output is easy to  <br/>\nverify and control the environment using constructs like Mock-Objects.<br/>\n<br/>\nDesign-by-contract does not replace unit-testing. When combined with  <br/>\ndesign-by-contract, unit testing is much more effective. When the  <br/>\napplication is constantly verifying its own state, failures tend to  <br/>\noccur much closer to the actual bug than otherwise. It is very possible  <br/>\nfor a testcase without DBC to succeed but leave the code in an unstable  <br/>\nstate. Since a unit test throws away its data after every run, this  <br/>\nwill not be detected without either more complex unit tests or  <br/>\ndesign-by-contract assertions.<br/>\n<br/>\nDesign-by-contract assertions also allow one to check internal state  <br/>\nthat one does not wish to expose to unit testing. Having unit tests  <br/>\nreach too deeply in the code makes your test suite fragile. Instead,  <br/>\nuse unit tests to exercise the code and verify external behavior while  <br/>\nletting the assertions verify internal consistency after each operation.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have used Eiffel, have used design-by-contract principles in other  <br/>\nlanguages, and have followed the process with home grown macros for  <br/>\nlonger than DBC has been called such. It is a useful tool, but DBC is  <br/>\nnot magic and does not make the need for testing go away.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; Now come on and don&#39;t tell me: &quot;We always used JUnit, most people do,<br/>\n&gt; why do you little inexperienced programer think you have a better<br/>\n&gt; idea than people like Gamma or Fowler?&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I am not satisfied with the JUnit and TDD &quot;paradigma&quot;. They are<br/>\n&gt; originated because of a *poverty* in Java programing language. If<br/>\n&gt; Java would support proper Design by Contract and a compiler for that<br/>\n&gt; than no one would bother with JUnit and TDD.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------ Yahoo!
