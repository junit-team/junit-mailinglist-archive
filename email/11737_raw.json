Agitar makes tools that automate\n&gt; and support developer testing. The editors of testdriven.com wish\n&gt; Kent great success in his new role.\n\n&gt; &quot;There is a strong movement towards increased accountability for\n&gt; software developers and software development organizations.\n&gt; Accountability is expected from every other profession in the world,\n&gt; and now software developers are being held accountable too.\n&gt; Developer Testing is a important step towards accountability. It\n&gt; gives developers a way to demonstrate the quality of the software\n&gt; they produce. Developing transparently, they become more productive\n&gt; by wasting less time reworking errors&quot;, says Kent.\n\nPerhaps, now that the &quot;developer testing&quot; usage has been blessed (with\nproper casing, no less !-) the community can acknowledge that\ndevelopers can automate testing &quot;beyond the unit&quot; (e.g. functional\ntesting). (Perhaps, even that GUI developers _should_ use them :-)\nJust because they named it xUnit doesn&#39;t mean you can only unit test\nwith it!\n\n&gt; http://www.testdriven.com/modules/news/article.php?storyid=161\n&gt; http://www.testdriven.com/modules/news/article.php?storyid=163\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n",
