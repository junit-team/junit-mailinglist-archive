I want one &quot;TrueDefaultPolicy&quot;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;for when we look up a FooPolicy and can&#39;t find it, we get something<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;more useful than a null pointer. We can subclass, the GrandpaFooPolicy<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;can subclass from the &quot;TrueDefaultPolicy&quot; and the FooPolicy can extend<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;the GrandpaFooPolicy, but you need a concrete instance of a base, and<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;you really only want one of them.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; <br/>\n&gt;&gt;It&#39;s reasonable to want only one of an object, but for me it comes down<br/>\n&gt;&gt;to one question: can I trust my team members not to create two? If I<br/>\n&gt;&gt;can, it makes sense to avoid the singleton. The enforcement that<br/>\n&gt;&gt;singleton brings is the solution to a problem, but the problem is social<br/>\n&gt;&gt;not technical. It pays to know whether you have the problem or not.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;    <br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;In short, no, I do not trust the team members. Nor do I trust the JVM.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Teams are rarely made of just smart, dedicated, senior people. And even <br/>\n&gt;the best make mistakes, see Murphy&#39;s Law. So the good engineering <br/>\n&gt;response to Murphy, who was a real engineer, is to reduce the chance <br/>\n&gt;that folks can do things wrong. Even when the team is only me, I&#39;m not <br/>\n&gt;sure it is wise to &#39;trust the team&#39;<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Pat, the thing is, I think we can generalize in either direction on this <br/>\nand it&#39;s dangerous either way. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe could say all applications are worked on by outstanding engineers who <br/>\ncan remember what they are supposed to do or not do in the code base, or <br/>\nwe can say all applications are absolutely critical and we can&#39;t trust <br/>\nourselves or our coworkers not to make mistakes so we must do everything <br/>\npossible to avoid them. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe fact of that matter is, all people and all applications are <br/>\ndifferent.  There are teams and applications with which I wouldn&#39;t <br/>\nhesitate to &quot;just create one&quot; rather than use a singleton, and there are <br/>\nteams and applications where I wouldn&#39;t do that simply because the team <br/>\nisn&#39;t a team or the application is so critical that spurious creation of <br/>\nan object could cause disaster.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think that we have to examine each situation for the cues that we need <br/>\nto make engineering decisions.  Otherwise they aren&#39;t really decisions.<br/>\n<br/>\nMichael Feathers<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.objectmentor.com\">http://www.objectmentor.com</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://beautifulcode.oreillynet.com/\">http://beautifulcode.oreillynet.com/</a></div>",
