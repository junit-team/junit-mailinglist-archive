There is an interesting new development,\nwhich\nwill enable what you are talking about for tool vendors.\n\nEssentially it is an attribute/meta-data based programming, where you will\nbe able\nto decorate any class, variable, method with meta data which will be\navailable for examination\nvia Reflection API; this will enable for tool-vendors to write code that\nremoves test or\nany other methos that you would like.  I think this is something considered\nfor JDK1.5.\n\nEvil Gates, has this sort of functionality built into all the .NET\nlanguages.\n\nLater, Mikhail.\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: David Jared [mailto:dajared@...]\nSent: Thursday, March 14, 2002 11:43 PM\nTo: junit@yahoogroups.com\nSubject: RE: [junit] Where to place test classes?\n\n\n\nHas any consideration been given to extending the Java\nlanguage specification to help resolve this issue? For\nexample, methods can be designated &quot;static&quot; or\n&quot;final&quot;. What about a &quot;test&quot; designation?  This would\nallow tests to be easily included inside classes, but\nthe tests could be removed in a &quot;release&quot; compile.  \n\nJava was developed before unit testing was a part of\nstandard software development work pactices.  The idea\nof extending the language for testability may present\nsome unique possibilies.\n\nThanks,\nDavid Jared\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
