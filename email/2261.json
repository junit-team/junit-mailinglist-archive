This is \ndone to test whether messages are being added to the server by Client-I. Server \nnever responds to the client which adds the message to it. So it is neccessary \nto have another Client listening if the message has been added to the \nserver.</font></div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\">But my tests fail as the Client II created to \nlisten to the messages added by Client-I doesnot get messages due to time some \ntime delay in adding and retreiving the messages. I cannot specify any time \nframe in which a message may be received. (though i tried putting a dealy of say \n100 milliseconds, but this does not work all time, as sometime it may take about \n100/200/500 milliseconds for the message to be added to the server). So i cannot \ndepend on time delay.</font></div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\">Please let me know if you have ideas to test such a \nsystem.</font></div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\">Manpreet</font></div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> <blockquote\n style=\"BORDER-LEFT:#000000 2px solid;MARGIN-LEFT:5px;MARGIN-RIGHT:0px;PADDING-LEFT:5px;PADDING-RIGHT:0px;\">\n  <div style=\"FONT:10pt arial;\">----- Original Message ----- </div>\n  <div\n style=\"BACKGROUND:#e4e4e4;FONT:10pt arial;\"><b>From:</b> \n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:egoine_@...\" title=\"egoine_@...\">Mathieu \n  Gervais</a> </div>\n  <div style=\"FONT:10pt arial;\"><b>To:</b> <a rel=\"nofollow\"\n target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\"\n title=\"junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a> </div>\n  <div style=\"FONT:10pt arial;\"><b>Sent:</b> Monday, August 06, 2001 3:59 \n  PM</div>\n  <div style=\"FONT:10pt arial;\"><b>Subject:</b> Re: [junit] RE: [XP] Need Advice \n  on Unit Testing Pain</div>\n  <div><br></div><tt>Hi Alain,<br><br>&nbsp; I suggest you use the method \n  getTableWithID() of HTTPUnit. Very powerfull<br>in helping the tests to \n  survive layout changes. Want it or not, HTML Tables<br>are the way layout gets \n  done, so you can excpect tens of tables to be added<br>to your pages in the \n  &quot;make it super nice&quot; phase. This method enables you to<br>esealy find a table \n  marked like this:<br><br>&lt;TABLE ID=errorMessages&gt;<br><br>so you can \n  easily do assertEquals( \n  0,<br>response.getTableWithId(&quot;errorMessages).getRowCount())<br><br>and code \n  other fancy methods \n  like<br><br>checkPageReturnedOkWithoutErrorMessages(reponse);<br>assertProductNumbersInCart(response,new \n  String [] {&quot;48&quot;,&quot;72&quot;,&quot;32&quot;,45&quot;} );<br><br>and so on...<br><br>But I do share \n  your pain. One of the major selling point of the web<br>development is fast \n  feature addition and fast UI design/modification. All<br>that speed makes it \n  hard for extensive web feature testing to follow the<br>pace. I think the \n  trick is to be as uniform as possible accross the site.<br>This helps testing \n  by sharing handing testing methods for all test cases and<br>by modifying only \n  theses methods when an inevitable major change happens. It<br>is also good for \n  the user experience to be uniform anyway.<br><br>mathieu<br><br>----- Original \n  Message -----<br>From: Alain RAVET<br>To: extremeprogramming@yahoogroups.com ; \n  junit@yahoogroups.com<br>Sent: Monday, August 06, 2001 4:15 AM<br>Subject: \n  [junit] RE: [XP] Need Advice on Unit Testing Pain<br><br><br>Paul,<br><br>Let \n  me share my &quot;experience&quot; on - bad - web testing pain reaction \n  :<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt; -----Message d&#39;origine-----<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; De : Paul \n  Hodgetts [mailto:prh@...]<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; Recently, developers have \n  stopped writing these web tests,<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; resorting to running the \n  tests manually by hand.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; ..
