There is a lot of information out there, and=\r\n also a lot of\nfree and open code, but this data is not organized in the wa=\r\ny Perl is,\nsuch as with the Perl CPAN, and as a result I am definitely gett=\r\ning\noverwhelmed and frustrated.  (Perhaps Larry Wall spoiled me.)\n\nI would =\r\nbe really grateful if anywone could point me to some excellent\n&quot;step by ste=\r\np&quot; information for getting started with Eclipse and JUnit.\n I should mentio=\r\nn that I will be needing to work with the\nSpringFramework, and ultimately c=\r\nustomizing the fancy new messaging\nsystems such as AMPQ.\n\nAs soon as I get =\r\n&quot;turned around&quot; I will be documenting everything I am\ndoing probably on the=\r\n Wikiversity site, which is a great place.\n\nThank you very much in advance,=\r\n John\n\nPS, if you are interested in the business model I am working on/with=\r\n\nand the group we are forming, and our philosophy, etc, etc, please ask.\n\n\n=\r\n\n\n\n\n",
