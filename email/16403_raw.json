Not a fan at all. I hate the idea of using method names in \nstrings. From the jMock web site (comparing jMock to EasyMock):\n\n&quot;We have found that the use of strings in jMock is not a huge \ndisadvantage, especially if you use an IDE that can apply refactorings \nto names in string constants. Often when doing TDD, the method named in \nan expectation will not yet be defined in any interface, and so code \ncompletion cannot be used. We have found that the flexibility1 allowed \nby the jMock API is better at reducing the work of refactoring than the \nuse of direct method calls.&quot;\n\nBullshit. I don&#39;t want to create a corresponding constant for every \nmethod I mock. If I&#39;m doing TDD (I don&#39;t), even if I code to a method \nthat doesn&#39;t exist yet, my IDE can generate the target method for me \nbased on my call. That won&#39;t work with JMock.\n\nEasyMock code is more readable and the type checking and IDE support is \n*much* better. I can&#39;t imagine what &quot;flexibility&quot; could possibly justify \nthe tradeoffs.\n\nGenerics have changed the playing field. EasyMock&#39;s API has stood up \nwell while jMock&#39;s has not.\n----- CrazyBob -----\n\nFirst, I don&#39;t know why he&#39;s creating a constant for every method he \nmocks. If he lives in a world where all literals must be stored in a \nconstant, that&#39;s not jMock&#39;s fault. That&#39;s called &quot;tyranny&quot; and is bound \nto bad for a number of other reasons.\n\nStill, there&#39;s a flipside to the whole &quot;can&#39;t generate a method stub&quot; \nargument. With EasyMock, if I use a faked or mocked method that doesn&#39;t \nyet exist, my test can&#39;t even compile yet! When I practise TDD, I often \ndesign interfaces, and forcing me to generate a method stub for a method \nI might not even like yet is annoying. Keeping the methods as strings \nallows me to write the test, compile it, and even run it before I decide \nwhether the interface or method signature is good enough to start \nputting into stone.\n\nAs for EasyMock being more readable, EasyMock 1.x certainly wasn&#39;t. It \nlooks like EasyMock 2.0 gives jMock a run for its money, at least in the \neasiest cases. The jury&#39;s out, since I haven&#39;t used it yet.\n\nAs for generics, well... it&#39;s no secret that I dislike generics, so I&#39;ll \nlet that comment pass. It might be right, but I don&#39;t care. :)\n-- \nJ. B.
