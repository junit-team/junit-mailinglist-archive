So my point is I<br/>\nthink it&#39;s worth spending time to design an extendable core rather than<br/>\nspending time designing features. (I know &quot;spending time&quot; in the case of<br/>\n&quot;assertCount++&quot;  is not really a big thing ;)  ).<br/>\n<br/>\nAn assert() could be just one more CoreEvent  to your CoreListener design.<br/>\n<br/>\nmathieu<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: Vladimir Bossicard<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSent: Sunday, July 22, 2001 4:40 PM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [junit] Proposition (?)

It&#39;s a simple enough thing<br/>\n(I<br/>\n&gt;think) that it should not be impossible to do.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\nI have studied the pluggability in JUnit and developped a first<br/>\nprototype.  What I have done is creating a basic runner that separates<br/>\nTextRunner and UIRunner from the JUnit core business.  My experience is<br/>\nthat it requires some changes but it is absolutely feasible.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you are familiar with the internal JUnit business, here is how it works:<br/>\n- the CoreRunner registeres itself as a TestListener to the TestResult<br/>\n(in fact there is now only one TestListener)<br/>\n- Plug-in modules register themselves as CoreListener to the CoreRunner<br/>\n- TestListener&#39;s events are passed to the plug-ins via the CoreListener<br/>\ninterface<br/>\n- new events (like when the runner starts/stops running the tests) are<br/>\nalso passed via the CoreListener interface<br/>\n<br/>\nNow for the &quot;count-assert&quot; mechanism: I don&#39;t think that adding a<br/>\nplug-in is the way to go.  The easiest way is to declare a static<br/>\nvariable in the Assert class.  This variable is accessible by the<br/>\nCoreRunner and adding methods to handle this variable in the CoreRunner<br/>\nobject is not a problem.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Vladimir </span></blockquote></div>",
