I feel pretty \n&gt; confident about their difference. I guess the problem i had \n&gt; and perhaps other is that whereas a theory is in fact a \n&gt; universal quantification ( \n&gt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_quantification). The \n&gt; problem is, while the set for each possible value is often \n&gt; indefinite, you have to be realistic and provide appropriate \n&gt; candidate data (using data parameter supplies). And that&#39;s \n&gt; when theories start to look a lot like parameterized tests, \n&gt; while in fact they are in nature very different .\n&gt; \n&gt; Raphael\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; On Thu, Oct 23, 2008 at 1:42 PM, Joakim Ohlrogge\n&gt; &lt;joakim.ohlrogge@...&gt;wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;   &gt; Thanks for the clear responses. What i see is that a theory is a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; (parametrized) test inside out; you don&#39;t specify what \n&gt; will work but \n&gt; &gt; &gt; you leave out what should not be tested (iow assumptions \n&gt; by leaving \n&gt; &gt; &gt; out the\n&gt; &gt; data\n&gt; &gt; &gt; for these cases).\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m not sure that there is a misunderstanding here but just \n&gt; to make sure:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; While what you wrote is technically true I think it simplifies the \n&gt; &gt; theory a bit. I would consider a long list of assumptions \n&gt; in a theory \n&gt; &gt; a smell, perhaps named: &quot;assmumptions is the mother of all \n&gt; screw ups&quot;\n&gt; &gt; :). I almost fell into the trap of using assumptions to filter the \n&gt; &gt; &quot;desired&quot; datapoints to the &quot;correct&quot; theory but that would be a \n&gt; &gt; violation of the idea, the idea is that the datapoints I have \n&gt; &gt; specified and all other datapoints I (or an automatic tool) \n&gt; can come \n&gt; &gt; up with should pass. I think that there is a subtle difference here \n&gt; &gt; between data driven tests and theories, data driven tests \n&gt; are merely a \n&gt; &gt; convenient way to create lots of specific examples while \n&gt; theories aim \n&gt; &gt; at the abstraction, the definition of the truth in this system.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; If a lot of assumptions are a smell, then what are our \n&gt; weapons against \n&gt; &gt; them? I found that declaring types help here and it pays off \n&gt; &gt; instantly. For instance, if I represent name as a String and phone \n&gt; &gt; number as a String and it is important to my theories to \n&gt; differentiate \n&gt; &gt; between the two I could ether:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Assume that any string with numbers in it is a phone number \n&gt; and that \n&gt; &gt; anything that is not a phone number is a name.\n&gt; &gt; Or, I could declare the type Name and the type PhoneNumber.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; In this case I would prefer a type.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; If I was intersted in defining what a long distance call is I could \n&gt; &gt; write that as a theory:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; @Theory\n&gt; &gt; public void makeLongDistanceCall(PhoneNumber from, \n&gt; PhoneNumber to) { \n&gt; &gt; assumeThat(from.areaCode, is(not(equalTo(to.areaCode))); \n&gt; Call call = \n&gt; &gt; new Call(from, to); assertTrue(call.isLongDistance());\n&gt; &gt; }\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I probably screwed up both the domain and the design but I hope my \n&gt; &gt; idea of what an assumptions role in a theory is and how \n&gt; theories are \n&gt; &gt; different than data-driven tests in spite of them both \n&gt; being driven by \n&gt; &gt; data.\n&gt; &gt; I also hope that in the case the domain is screwed up it should be \n&gt; &gt; perfectly clear from the above theory to anyone who knows \n&gt; the domain.\n&gt; &gt; Finally, I hope this helps someone :)\n&gt; &gt; /J\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --\n&gt; Raphael Parree\n&gt; CTO\n&gt; SOA Evangelist\n&gt; \n&gt; Trivera Technologies Global J2EE Education, Mentoring, \n&gt; Courseware & Consulting Services\n&gt; phone:+31 152600 448\n&gt; phone +33 683 468663\n&gt; Disclaimer...\n&gt; &quot;The information contained in this message may be \n&gt; confidential and is intended to be exclusively for the \n&gt; addressee.
