I was recently staying\nat the Crowne Plaza for Smalltalk Solutions and had a chance to wander\naround some.. all the way to Little Italy actually.. great place!]\n\n&gt; I don&#39;t like tools that make it easier for me to do things that are \n&gt; a poor substitute for doing other things. That&#39;s my &quot;anti-mock&quot; kick\n&gt; right now. :)\n\nOk.. I&#39;m sure there&#39;s logic in there somewhere.  I&#39;m pro-mock myself.\n\nShould we get buttons made for XPAU?\n\n&quot;Oh.. look over there in the openspace .. there&#39;s a pro-mock\ndemonstration going on&quot;.\n\nDave\n\n\n\n",
