I think these\nkinds o=\r\nf discussions are valuable for synthesizing divergent experiences.\nHere are=\r\n my thoughts on the issues raised below.\n\nRe: multiple asserts. One of my g=\r\noals for tests is that they point precisely\nto the problem when they fail. =\r\nIf I have many asserts in one test,\nespecially if the assertions are inters=\r\npersed with calls to the objects\nunder test, then I run the risk of having =\r\na failing test that requires\nconsiderable investigation before I can see wh=\r\nat went wrong. OTOH, I haven&#39;t\nfound it useful to deliberately limit myself=\r\n to a single assertion per test,\nas is the practice of some list members.\n\n=\r\nRe: code that throws exceptions. I prefer to declare the test case as\nthrow=\r\ning the exception. I haven&#39;t ever had trouble debugging from the\ninformatio=\r\nn provided in the exception. Discarding that exception and getting\na generi=\r\nc AssertionError seems a step backwards to me.\n\nKent Beck\nThree Rivers Inst=\r\nitute\n\n&gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; From: junit@yahoogroups.com [mailto:j=\r\nunit@yahoogroups.com] On \n&gt; Behalf Of C=E9dric Beust ? \n&gt; Sent: Tuesday, Fe=\r\nbruary 21, 2006 12:54 PM\n&gt; To: junit@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Subject: Re: [junit]=\r\n JUnit Anti-patterns\n&gt; \n&gt; Hi Joe,\n&gt; \n&gt; Joe Schmetzer wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;I&#39;ve j=\r\nust updated the JUnit Anti-patterns page I maintain at\n&gt; &gt; &gt;http://www.exub=\r\nero.com/junit/antipatterns.html. I&#39;d be \n&gt; interested in\n&gt; &gt; &gt;any feedback,=\r\n if people want to suggest additions or improvements.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; I don&#39;t reall=\r\ny understand this:\n&gt; \n&gt; This is a design decision that permeates JUnit, and=\r\n when you decide to\n&gt; report multiple failures per test, you begin to fight=\r\n against JUnit.\n&gt; \n&gt; I don&#39;t see how having more that one assert &quot;fights ag=\r\nainst&quot; \n&gt; JUnit (what\n&gt; does this even mean?) and in the code that I see ev=\r\nery day, \n&gt; very few tests\n&gt; contain only one assert.  Especially if your t=\r\nests require \n&gt; two or three\n&gt; statements to set up in the test method (not=\r\n in setUp()), in \n&gt; which case\n&gt; there is even more to be gained to run mor=\r\ne than one assert \n&gt; so you don&#39;t\n&gt; have to duplicate this code in other te=\r\nst methods.\n&gt; \n&gt; Also, the fix you show in your documentation is simplistic=\r\n.  \n&gt; What if the\n&gt; code to be extracted is specific to that test method?  =\r\nIf you \n&gt; move it to\n&gt; setUp(), you are suddenly charging *all* the other t=\r\nest \n&gt; methods of that same\n&gt; class with this set up cost that they have no=\r\n need for.\n&gt; \n&gt; Also, it seems to me your recommended pattern for code that=\r\n \n&gt; must throw an\n&gt; exception (&quot;don&#39;t catch it and declare the exception in=\r\n the throws\n&gt; statement&quot;) goes against common practice.  Plus, it will \n&gt; c=\r\nause JUnit to\n&gt; report an Error instead of a Failure, although this distinc=\r\ntion is\n&gt; thankfully going away with JUnit4.\n&gt; \n&gt; A more common way to addr=\r\ness this problem is to catch the \n&gt; exception and do a\n&gt; fail().\n&gt; \n&gt; Other=\r\n than that, your guide is fine advice.\n&gt; \n&gt; --\n&gt; C=E9dric\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; [Non-text=\r\n portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; Yahoo!
