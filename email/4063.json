However, I am getting problems running test suites as the order of execution does not appear to be constant. <br/>\nTests are written in this order : <br/>\ntestGetVehicle() <br/>\ntestAddVehicle() <br/>\ntestSaveVehicle() <br/>\ntestDeleteVehicle() <br/>\n<br/>\nOverall flow is to retrieve an entity, modify it, then delete it. <br/>\n<br/>\nTests appear to be executed in this order : <br/>\ntestDeleteVehicle() <br/>\ntestGetVehicle() <br/>\ntestAddVehicle() <br/>\ntestSaveVehicle() <br/>\n<br/>\nBy running out of order the testDeleteVehicle() method cant find the modified entity, and fails its test. <br/>\n<br/>\nUsing JBuilder 6, is this related to most recent changes and compilation ? JUnitEE itself appears to be working fine. Any pointers of where to look ? <br/>\n<br/>\nThanks <br/>\n<br/>\nScott <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n----------<br/>\nGet a free, personalised email address at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://another.com\">http://another.com</a><br/>\nTXT ALRT!
