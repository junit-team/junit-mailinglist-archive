When I was challenged by someone why I used theories instead of a parameterized test to test an interface contract I did not have a good answer.  This helps me with having that good answer.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a>, David Saff &lt;david@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Berin,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Charlie may already have said it all better than I can, so I&#39;ll try a<br/>\n&gt; brief summary.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Parameterized tests are an answer key:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; a = 3, b =  4 =&gt; foo(a,b) = 5<br/>\n&gt; a = 5, b = 12 =&gt; foo(a,b) = 13<br/>\n&gt; a = 0, b =  4 =&gt; foo(a,b) = 4<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Theories are a universal truth:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; a^2 + b^2 = foo(a,b)^2<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Sometimes answer keys are easier to write than universal truths.
