We ended up doing our own Assert class whose <br/>\nroot method was this (there were convenience methods built on top of <br/>\nthis, so it didn&#39;t have to always be especially verbose):<br/>\n<br/>\nvoid assert(String passedMessage, String failedMessage, boolean <br/>\ncondition);<br/>\n<br/>\nOur TestRunner was altered to print these messages as they are being <br/>\nexecuted, along with the test name.  Be aware that I don&#39;t suggest doing <br/>\nthis for unit testing, as I believe the philosophy of only displaying <br/>\nresults when it breaks to be a good thing.   But for those doing things <br/>\nthat aren&#39;t necessarily unit testing, it has been extremely useful.  <br/>\nHere&#39;s a portion of the output:<br/>\n<br/>\nTestTestlets().testPassed(): [ PASSED 12/10/2001 02:18:28 ]<br/>\n  [ PASSED This will never fail ]<br/>\nTestTestlets().testFailed(): [ FAILED 12/10/2001 02:18:28 ]<br/>\n  [ FAILED This could never succeed ]<br/>\nTestTestlets().testTestletWithArgs(testing 1, 2, 3): [ PASSED 12/10/2001 <br/>\n02:18:28 ]<br/>\n  [ PASSED Msg does not equal null ]<br/>\n  [ got argument: &quot;testing 1, 2, 3&quot; ]<br/>\nTestTestlets().testPassed(): [ PASSED 12/10/2001 02:18:28 ]<br/>\n  [ PASSED This will never fail ]<br/>\nTestTestlets().testFailed(): [ FAILED 12/10/2001 02:18:28 ]<br/>\n  [ FAILED This could never succeed ]<br/>\nTestTestlets().testErrorReporting(): [ E R R O R 12/10/2001 02:18:28 ]<br/>\n  [ ERROR This an emergency error of your junit system ]<br/>\n<br/>\n-shane<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Saturday, December 8, 2001, at 08:07  AM, Mike Clark wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Sriram Anandraj wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Hi Robert/Vladimir,<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; You both r right.
