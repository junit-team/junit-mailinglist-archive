That&#39;s like making your tec=\r\nh support user friendly by outsourcing\n&gt; it to trained professionasl in Ind=\r\nia rather than letting your clients\n&gt; talk directly to the developers. Ther=\r\ne&#39;s a ton of theory (i.e.\n&gt; rationalizations) to support doing that, and it=\r\n&#39;s completely\n&gt; counterproductive in practice.\n&gt;\n&gt; Interfaces are very popu=\r\nlar among the most theoretical programmers: i.e.\n&gt; exactly the sort of prog=\r\nrammers who are likely to write books, read\n&gt; books about OO theory, and ha=\r\nng out on lists like this one. However in\n&gt; my experience concrete classes =\r\nare much simpler and much preferred by\n&gt; the vast majority of pragmatic pro=\r\ngrammers just getting their jobs done.\n\n\nThis goes against my direct experi=\r\nence and against the widely accepted\nrecommendations that have emerged in t=\r\nhe Java world these past years.\n\nInterfaces are good. You shouldn&#39;t abuse t=\r\nhem, of course, but they\ncontribute greatly to simplifying the contract bet=\r\nween two parties.\nInterfaces are also the foundation of very successful sof=\r\ntware platforms,\nsuch as COM, Eclipse and Spring.\n\nBut your reaction proves=\r\n the point I was making earlier even better than I\ncould have:  where do yo=\r\nu draw the line when you are trying to &quot;do the\nsimplest thing that could po=\r\nssibly work&quot;?\n\nIn my experience, interfaces are very often part of this &quot;si=\r\nmplest thing&quot; as\nlong as they benefit both your tests and your users.\n\n-- \n=\r\nC=E9dric\nhttp://testng.org\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been r=\r\nemoved]\n\n\n",
