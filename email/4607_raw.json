But this can get messy when dealing\n&gt; &gt; &gt; with many files and packages. Is there a more graceful way of\n&gt; doing\n&gt; &gt; &gt; this?\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; a) Organize test cases in the same package as the class under test\n&gt; &gt; b) Change the accessibility of the class under test\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ------------------\n&gt; But a and b are the things that I don&#39;t want to do, if you read my\n&gt; original message.  There are many reasons why I need it in a\n&gt; different directory.  Also to change the production code just to\n&gt; satisfy unit testing doesn&#39;t sound so good.  There is a reason why we\n&gt; didn&#39;t want to make it public.  So do you know of any graceful way of\n&gt; doing this besides a and b?\n&gt;\n\nI read and understood your limitations.  The fact of the matter is the JVM is\nspecifically design not to allow access to package-protected classes in other\npackages.  So I&#39;m offering the best advice I have given that constraint.\n\nBy the way, organizing the test classes in the same packages doesn&#39;t mean the\nsource code has to be in the same directory.  I use a parallel (mirrored)\ndirectory structure to avoid lumping everything in the same directory.\n\nSome have offered reflection as an alternative to (a) and (b) above, as\nwell.\n\n&quot;Doctor, it hurts when I put my code and its tests in different packages, and\nthen try to test non-public methods.&quot;\n\nMike\n\n--\nMike Clark\nClarkware Consulting, Inc.\nhttp://www.clarkware.com\n720.851.2014\n\n\n",
