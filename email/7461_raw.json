April =\r\n2003 09:46 schrieb javainsel:\n&gt; I wish I would be a expert to convince you =\r\nof a better approach than\n&gt; JUnit provides (and TDD).\nYou can&#39;t, because Ex=\r\nceptions, Assertions, JUnit and Design by Contract are \nnot competing but c=\r\nomplementary approaches on the same aspect: Increase the \nstability and rob=\r\nustness of code and decrease the number of bugs.\n&quot;DBC is better than JUnit&quot;=\r\n is like saying &quot;Bolts are better than glue&quot;.\n\n\n&gt; But I try.\nOf course you =\r\nmay.\n\n&gt; I consider Design by Contract to be suitable to replace JUnit and T=\r\nDD\n&gt; completely. It can provide many benefits and by the same time not\n&gt; ha=\r\nving all the side effects that JUnit and TDD have. Examples are\n&gt; Eiffel an=\r\nd Java Modelling Language (JML).\n&gt;\n&gt; Why? How? I&#39;ll explain.\n&gt;\n&gt; Testing of=\r\n the code (methods) can be done with precondition,\n&gt; invartiants and postco=\r\nnditions (the contracts). Thats how I\n&gt; understand Design by Contract. You =\r\nwrite your method definition and\n&gt; then you write the contract for it. Then=\r\n you implement your method.\nNo.\n\nYou must differ between:\na) External preco=\r\nnditions and postconditions.\nTextField tf =3D (TextField) e.getSource();\nMy=\r\nDate df =3D new MyDate();\ndf.setDayOfMonth(Integer.parseInt(tf.getText()));=\r\n\nDesign by Contract won&#39;t solve the problem, it could only help.\nSuch Preco=\r\nnditions currently must be solved using Exceptions.\nYou even don&#39;t use Asse=\r\nrtions for that, Exceptions are used there.\nDesignByContract can only help =\r\nby replacing\nif (day &lt; 1 || day &gt; 31) { throw new IllegalArgumentException(=\r\n); }\nwith a contract. A more declarative way for restricting argument range=\r\ns is \nalways increasing robustness and therefore welcome.\nOr take a look at=\r\n the next() method of the interface Iterator. Design by \nContract won&#39;t hel=\r\np you to avoid the problem of calling next() once too \noften.\n\n\nb) Internal=\r\n preconditions, postconditions and invariants.\nHere you may use Java assert=\r\nions, e.g.:\nint w =3D dice.roll();\nswitch (w) {\n    case 1: case 2: case 3:=\r\n case 4:\n        // do something\n        break;\n    default: // This must b=\r\ne a four-sided dice\n        assert false;\n}\n\nc) Complex processes.\nImagine =\r\nyou want to test a shopping cart system.\nTests might be:\n- - place no order=\r\n with a logged-in customer but an empty shopping cart.\n- - place an order w=\r\nith a logged-in customer and non-empty shopping cart\n- - place no order wit=\r\nh no logged-in customer\nOr how do you use DBC to verify that your classes c=\r\norrectly use the database?\n\nd) Contracts\nAnd there, differ between contract=\r\ns on interfaces and contracts on \nimplementations. Contracts on interfaces =\r\nsometimes simply *can&#39;t* be checked \nby the compiler. And contracts on user=\r\n input also can&#39;t be checked by the \ncompiler. So these Contracts are just =\r\na more convenient way for \nIllegalArgumentExceptions and IllegalStateExcept=\r\nions.\n\n\n&gt; Now the great thing: When you compile your code the implementatio=\r\nn\n&gt; can be checked whether it obeys the contract. If not, a compile error\n&gt;=\r\n is thrown. That it!\nThis is a great feature, and DBC is welcome.\n\n&gt; No JUn=\r\nit test needed! Not TDD needed!\nWrong.\nThere are enough things that DBC can=\r\n&#39;t ensure to work correctly.\nJust because some parts of the system work acc=\r\nordingly to their contract and \nthey use each other in a correct way doesn&#39;=\r\nt mean the system is bug-free.\n\nDon&#39;t understand me wrong, I am not against=\r\n DBC, I like DBC and I welcome DBC, \nDBC is very helpful. And DBC can even =\r\nreplace *some* Unit Tests and \nAssertions. But DBC cannot replace *all* Uni=\r\nt Tests.\n\n&gt; Besides this, a contract serves as a documentation.\nSo do Unit =\r\nTests and Javadoc. But I welcome DBC as an enrichment of that \ndocumentatio=\r\nn.\n\n&gt; And it can use invariants which JUnit will always lack of.\nHow does J=\r\nUnit lack of invariants? Or do you talk of *internal* invariants?\n\n&gt; Now co=\r\nme on and don&#39;t tell me: &quot;We always used JUnit, most people do,\n&gt; why do yo=\r\nu little inexperienced programer think you have a better\n&gt; idea than people=\r\n like Gamma or Fowler?&quot;\nBut we do.\nIt&#39;s because we must use something exist=\r\ns. Until SUN has made it part of the \nJava 2 SDK SE or at least published a=\r\n JSR for the JCP, DBC for Java will \nremain a castle in the air, a pipe dre=\r\nam, a mirage. Public add-ons for DBC \nwill not work because it&#39;s a feature =\r\nthe compiler must support and the \ncompiler is not yet pluggable - look at =\r\nAspectJ and their problems, and I \ncouldn&#39;t use DBC together with AOP for t=\r\nhat, and then, I&#39;d prefer AOP over \nDBC, not because AOP could replace DBC =\r\nin anyway, but AOP adds much more \nfeature value to Java than DBC.\n\nI think=\r\n if a DBC feature would exist, many would use it. But currently it \ndoesn&#39;t=\r\n. It&#39;s just optional for those seeking it, far away from being mature.\n\nI t=\r\nell you, true DBC will never be there in Java, similar to the fact that we =\r\n\nwill never see true aspect oriented programming in Java (the latter becaus=\r\ne \nonce a class is loaded in Java, its methods can&#39;t be changed, and Aspect=\r\nJ is \nnot really aspect oriented because it can&#39;t provide aspects for class=\r\nes not \ncompiled with AspectJ).\n\n&gt; I am not satisfied with the JUnit and TD=\r\nD &quot;paradigma&quot;. They are\n&gt; originated because of a *poverty* in Java program=\r\ning language.\nNo, that definitely is not true.\nThere are several kinds of t=\r\nests:\n- - Unit-Tests for a method\n- - Unit-Tests for classes\n- - Unit-Tests=\r\n for sequences of methods\n- - Integration tests that test how some classes =\r\n/ methods work together\n- - Framework-Tests\n\nVery many of these can&#39;t be re=\r\nplaced by DBC.\nAnd not having a certain feature is not neccessarily a pover=\r\nty.\nIn Java, not having (manipulable) pointers is a missing feature but def=\r\ninitely \nthe opposite of poverty.\n\n\n&gt; If Java would support proper Design b=\r\ny Contract and a compiler for that\n&gt; than no one would bother with JUnit an=\r\nd TDD.\nWrong.\nIf Design By Contract Proposed would already be part of Java,=\r\n even more people \nwould use JUnit and TDD because even more people would b=\r\ne aware of the need \nof ways to increase stability and robustness of code a=\r\nnd search for such \nways, and DBC lacks many facilities Unit-Testing provid=\r\nes. That doesn&#39;t mean \nthat DBC is bad and they wouldn&#39;t use it, they would=\r\n use it. It&#39;s like with \nsweets. If you don&#39;t know sweets, you don&#39;t search=\r\n for them. If you know \nchocolate, you&#39;re curious wether there are other sw=\r\neets, too.\n\nBut some things can&#39;t be done with DBC. For instance, imagine y=\r\nou have a class \nthat accesses a database. You want to know if the class ma=\r\nkes correct use of \nthe interface and *also* correctly deals with problems =\r\n(exceptions etc.) \n*and* also uses the correct data.\nWith JUnit, just use s=\r\nome Dummies, Stubs and Mocks instead of the real \ndatabase connection and y=\r\nou know wether your code works correctly.\nThis is something you simply *can=\r\n&#39;t* completely cover with DBC.\nDBC can make some of these tests superflous,=\r\n but others will persist still \nbeing required.\n\n\n\nI appreciate your engage=\r\nment for DBC. I&#39;m a fan of DBC myself and I&#39;ve already \nexperimented with D=\r\nBC a bit.\n\nBut &quot;DBC is better than JUnit&quot; is like saying &quot;Bolts are better =\r\nthan glue&quot;.\nIn the best case scenario, you could use both.\nJava has no DBC.=\r\n So instead of telling JUnit users Bolts are better than glue \nyou should t=\r\nell SUN to provide bolts in the first place.\n\nGo ahead, go to the Java webs=\r\nite and vote for DBC, as I have already done, \nthat&#39;s much more helpful.\nht=\r\ntp://developer.java.sun.com/developer/bugParade/bugs/4449383.html\n\nLast but=\r\n not least, just because a feature is good it needn&#39;t neccessarily be \nimpl=\r\nemented in the language. Otherwise, we&#39;d create a darn heavy mixture of \nC,=\r\n Java, Perl, SmallTalk, Eiffel, Lisp, Prolog and XSLT:\n\n/** Print all those=\r\n elements of an array that have string representations \nstarting with white=\r\n space.\n * @... some list\n * @... some list containing e=\r\nlements with strings starting with \nwhitespace\n*/\npublic static void someme=\r\nthod(@[/^&#92;s/]) {\n    print for (@ARGV);\n}\n\n/** Print all elements of a list=\r\n.\n * @... some list\n * @... $_ list head\n * @...=\r\nam @list tail of list, if empty $_ is printed and method \nreturns immediatl=\r\ny\n*/\npublic static printList($_, @list[.length&gt;0 :|| print && return]) {\n  =\r\n  return print && printList @list; // print $_ and recurse\n}\nor alternative=\r\nly\npublic static printList($_, @_) {\n    return print && printList @_;\n}\npu=\r\nblic static printList($_) {\n    return print;\n}\n\n\n/** Calculate the sqrt of=\r\n a number. num must be &gt;0 otherwise an \nIllegalArgumentException is thrown.=\r\n\n*/\npublic static void sqrt(double num[&gt;0]) {\n# ...\n}\n\n/** Handle all Illeg=\r\nalArgumentExceptions occuring on gui input */\naspect GUIExceptions {\n    po=\r\nintcut userInput(gui.** o[instanceof ActionListener]) : target(o) && \ncall(=\r\nvoid ActionListener.actionPerformed(ActionEvent[.getSource() instanceof \nTe=\r\nxtField] ev));\n    after () throwing (IllegalArgumentException e) :userInpu=\r\nt(gui.** o) {\n        use dynamicTyping;\n\twith this, JOptionPane showMessag=\r\neDialog(ev.getSource(), e, localize(&quot;Error \nin input&quot;), ERROR_MESSAGE);\n   =\r\n     return;\n    }\n}\n\nType where you want, don&#39;t type where you don&#39;t want,=\r\n use DBC together with \nlist processing, etc., make the language full of fe=\r\natures. I know Perl is \ninfamous for its featurism (I really like, no, I lo=\r\nve Perl).\nI&#39;d really like such a melting pot of languages (if I&#39;d not need =\r\nto do some \nnormal work to earn money, I&#39;d design such a language). Complet=\r\ne freedom. \nComplete list of features that have ever been into a language. =\r\nLook at the \ncode above. It uses dynamic typing, declarative lists, list pr=\r\nocessing, \ndynamic argument lists and, for design by contract, predicates, =\r\nand it also \nfeatures automatic variables ($_) and regular expressions. The=\r\n last one \ncreates an aspect which handles all IllegalArgumentExceptions th=\r\nrown in \nActionListeners that are in subpackages of gui and invoked from Te=\r\nxtFields by \ndisplaying a message dialog and setting the stack back to norm=\r\nal state \n(return). The with keyword changes the scope by adding JOptionPan=\r\ne to the \nlocal scope. The use dynamicTyping prevents the compiler from com=\r\nplaining \nabout incompatible types, during runtime ClassCastExceptions may =\r\noccur if the \ndesired type is not castable and not String. (These examples =\r\nperhaps still \nhave some ambiguity regarding the use and meaning of predica=\r\ntes). But would \nothers like such a language?\n\n\nI don&#39;t want to say DBC alo=\r\nne makes Java code less readable. I just want to \nsay that a rich set of fe=\r\natures can make a language a rich language as well \nas a *reduced* set of f=\r\neatures can make a language a rich language. And up to \nnow, the latter was=\r\n the case with Java. Some want to introduce DBC, some want \nto introduce AO=\r\nP, some want to introduce regular expressions, some want to \nintroduce dyna=\r\nmic typing, some want to introduce dynamic scoping, some want \nto introduce=\r\n global variables, some want to introduce dynamic variables, some \nwant to =\r\nintroduce configurable scoping, some want to introduce list \nprocessing, so=\r\nme want to introduce predicates. But hey, just because Java \ndoesn&#39;t have a=\r\nll these features, it isn&#39;t a bad language.\n\nOf course, now, 8 years after =\r\nJava was born, it&#39;s easy to say &quot;Java lacks \nthis&quot; and &quot;Java lacks that&quot;. B=\r\nut Java is dominant, we have to deal with Java \nand the way how it is now, =\r\nwe can only use the JCP and external APIs like \nJUnit to improve Java. And =\r\nJava isn&#39;t too bad at all.\n\nIf I had to decide wether to add DBC *or* AOP t=\r\no Java, my vote was for AOP, \ndefinitely. DBC is not so important at all, i=\r\nt saves much less money than AOP \ncould.\n\n\nBye\n\nP.S.:\nPlease, don&#39;t tell us=\r\n to purchase iContract ;-)\n- -- \nITCQIS GmbH\nChristian Wolfgang Hujer\nGesch=\r\n=E4ftsf=FChrender Gesellschafter\nTelefon: +49  (0)89  27 37 04 37\nTelefax: =\r\n+49  (0)89  27 37 04 39\nE-Mail: Christian.Hujer@...\nWWW: http://www.=\r\nitcqis.com/\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\nVersion: GnuPG v1.0.7 (GNU/Linux)=\r\n\n\niD8DBQE+iyOQzu6h7O/MKZkRApcWAJkBmOhP3/CwJlF33Bf98vgSLyqvGwCeLqLm\nhmMG4Fx4=\r\n2SsjE1GRP7oSjEw=3D\n=3DnKRQ\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----\n\n\n",
