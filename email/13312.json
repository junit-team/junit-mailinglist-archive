In fact from time to time I use the &quot;OO behaviour&quot; Junit shows, by<br/>\n&gt;  implementing the Abstract Testcase pattern.<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;  &gt; I did not want to &#39;derail&#39; the<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; discussion from testing to making design changes and thatz<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; why I made it clear that &#39;letz not question the design&#39;.<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;  Yes, I understand that.<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;  But, as I tried to say earlier, the &quot;inventors&quot; of Junit, and many of their<br/>\n&gt;  users, actually actively *use* writing tests as a design technique. So<br/>\n&gt;  &quot;questioning the design&quot; actually doesn&#39;t sound like &quot;derailing&quot; to me, but<br/>\n&gt;  quite on topic. Your mileage may vary, of course.<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;  &gt; Also someone was of the opinion that deep heirarchy could be<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; a bad design..I wanted to step-in and say &#39;of course not..it has it&#39;s<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; own reason&#39;. <br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;  I believe you that you have your reasons. What I&#39;m not going to believe<br/>\n&gt; that<br/>\n&gt;  easily is that the design really cannot possibly be improved by flattening<br/>\n&gt;  the hierarchy - that simply too strongly contradicts my experience. It<br/>\n&gt; would<br/>\n&gt;  have been interesting to discuss this specific instance, and I would have<br/>\n&gt;  expected to learn something from it. But I also understand and respect that<br/>\n&gt;  you are not interested in such a discussion.<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;  &gt;&gt;  &gt; In real life, faulty or imperfect designs are the norm.<br/>\n&gt;  &gt;&gt; <br/>\n&gt;  &gt;&gt;  Sure. That&#39;s one reason unit testing is so valuable: it makes some<br/>\n&gt;  &gt;&gt; of the  imperfectionism more visible, so that we can work on it.<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;  &gt; &#39;Faulty or imperfect design&#39;- well thatz not the case when we<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; can&#39;t use jUnit for this purpose.<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;  I don&#39;t understand what you want to say here.<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;  &gt; Sometimes the app design might<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; not provide interfaces to such a granular level that unit<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; test might need.  It doesn&#39;t mean the design is imperfect or<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; sub-optimal. <br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;  With all due respect, in my experience it very likely means exactly that,<br/>\n&gt; as<br/>\n&gt;  it means that things are rather strongly coupled. But perhaps we should<br/>\n&gt;  simply agree to disagree here...?<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;  No hard feelings,<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;  Ilja<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;  ________________________________<br/>\n&gt;  Yahoo!
