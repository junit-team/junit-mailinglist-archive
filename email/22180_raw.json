Pretty muc=\r\nh\nlike aspects work. This way you could enrich the test-run by declarativel=\r\ny\nhooking into the execution. Having global rules you could for instance,\ng=\r\niven a match-criteria selects points in the run to hook into.\n\nHow about &quot;d=\r\neclaratively enhance&quot; as a meaning?\n\nWhatever implementation you choose I h=\r\nave the following wishes based on\nworking with bumblebee and trying to do t=\r\nhese kind of global enhancements:\n\n* That I do not /have to/ run the tests =\r\nvia a specific suite to have my\nglobal rules applied. The reason is that it=\r\n&#39;s sometimes desirable to run\nonly one test and it would be nice if that te=\r\nst is enhanced in the same way\nit would be if run via the suite.\n\n* That I =\r\nwould not have to add anymore information than can be found on the\nclass pa=\r\nth. The reason is that needing specific configuration such as system\nproper=\r\nties or environment variables would make my tests harder to run.\n\nI have of=\r\nten wanted to make this kind of global rules and I think that\nhaving the po=\r\nssibility would open up for a host of new ways to creatively\nenhance JUnit.=\r\n Tools such as bumblebee being one   of many things that would\nbe simple to=\r\n do given such a feature. I hooked into a suite to capture\nSystem.out for b=\r\numblebee documentation and it works well given that I run\nvia that suite. I=\r\nf I don&#39;t run via that suite I have experienced hard to\ndebug problems.\n\n\n-=\r\n----------------------------------------------------\nJoakim Ohlrogge\nAgical=\r\n AB\nV=E4sterl=E5nggatan 79, 2 tr\n111 29 Stockholm, SWEDEN\n\nMobile: +46-708-=\r\n754004\nBlog: johlrogge.wordpress.com\nE-mail: joakim.ohlrogge@...\n\n\nOn=\r\n Sat, Dec 5, 2009 at 7:43 PM, Kent Beck &lt;kentb@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt; All=\r\n,\n&gt;\n&gt; I understand global rules operationally not denotationally.

To have the r=\r\nule working in several tests,\n&gt; you have to place the Rule in each test.\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; However, I am searching for a way to activate a Rule for all the =\r\ntests\n&gt; that are executed, without needing to add the rule to each test. Pe=\r\nrhaps by\n&gt; specifying a Java property parameter when running the tests (I c=\r\nould also\n&gt; set this as a global Java option, therefore being used upon eac=\r\nh execution\n&gt; of the JVM).\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Do you know if this is possible?\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; The reason why I need this, is: I am making the plans and gatherin=\r\ng the\n&gt; ideas for creating a simple Swing application that will display the=\r\n results\n&gt; of the executed tests (just like the JUnit view in Eclipse/Idea/=\r\nNetbeans,\n&gt; but perhaps with more details, and also available for anyone, n=\r\not just IDE\n&gt; users). Currently I developed a small agent rule, that you ca=\r\nn place in your\n&gt; test, and it will report to the console the status of you=\r\nr tests (the Swing\n&gt; console runs remotely).\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; This is ok, but it=\r\n means that you will have to add this rule to each\n&gt; and every test that yo=\r\nu have. It also means that will not be an easy task to\n&gt; disable this rule,=\r\n if you don&#39;t want it anymore.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Therefore a possibility to enabl=\r\ne Rules globally for all tests I think\n&gt; is the best solution for my case, =\r\nand also a good tool to have for various\n&gt; other tasks.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; What do=\r\n you think? Also, what do you think about the Swing console\n&gt; idea?\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; Cheers,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Bogdan\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; -------------------------=\r\n-----------\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Yahoo!
