It was nothing big: three weeks of Saturdays -- but it was my first professional project with a dynamically-typed language with no type checker. This caused me some problems, just because I&#39;m not used to it. I usually say, &quot;The compiler just stops me from making mistakes that I don&#39;t make anyway.&quot; I suppose that&#39;s not quite right for me.\n\nAnyhow, that&#39;s just a lead-in to my comment. In many cases, I would have either an unexpected &#39;nil&#39; value, or an object that doesn&#39;t understand an expected message. My first instinct is to get in there with &quot;p this&quot; and &quot;p that&quot;... then I thought of this: if I have a &#39;nil&#39; object over here, then there must be a bug over there... and when I started writing tests checking that results are non-nil over there, I no longer needed to trace my code.\n\nI&#39;m still learning.\n\nSo said steven.hale@... on 3/13/2003 --------------------\n\nMy debugging habits are usually something like this:\n\n1. Read the error message (if there is one)\n2. Think\n3. Read the log\n4. Think\n5. Write a unit test\n6. Launch the debugger\n\nSince adopting junit (2 -3 years ago) I can honestly say I&#39;ve not yet been\nforced down to level 6! I try to encourage programmers in my team not to\nstart at 6 first.\n\nJudging by the varied responses there&#39;s clearly a whole range of other\nsuccessful strategies - maybe it&#39;s related to the type of application being\nprogrammed.\n\nSteven\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYahoo!
