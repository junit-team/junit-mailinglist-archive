Unfortunately the feature is not officially included in JUnit.<br>Nowadays I prefer @Concurrency annotation on the top of test-class instead of parallel computer. The annotation is more suites to the JUnit runners.<br>Somebody already made just post on GitHub regarding such annotation, but I do not remember the pull request number.<br>This kind of @Concurrency annotation handling is quite easy to develop, so if you want to we can vote for it now.<br><br>Tibor17</div>",
