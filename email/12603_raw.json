I&#39;m not afraid to write long method names, but sometimes\nit gets out of hand and I need a paragraph to explain the situation. \nGenerally, this is testing some kind of complicated business logic,\nwhere the word &quot;logic&quot; here is often a cruel double-entendre.  An\nexample:\n\npublic void testMultipleCustomerPurchaseOrderEntriesForOneSalesOrderLine();\n\nThe test method is about a page of code, on the heavy side of the\naverage for our codebase but nothing gigantic.  Still, I felt it\nneeded a comment in plain english, which is:\n\nTests that this mapper creates multiple customerPurchaseOrder entries\nassociated with the sales order line, when multiples exist across line\nitems.\n\nThis particular example is partly about readability (you could infer a\nlot of the information, possibly, from the method name) and part about\ndisambiguity.  There are other tests involving CustomerPurchaseOrders\nand Sales Order Lines that are similar.\n\nMost of the time, these comments are written before the test.  I guess\nyou could say I practice document-first test development.  I write a\nsentence or two about what the test is going to do (or just a method\nname if it suffices -- you&#39;re right that it often does) then I write\nthe test.\n\nUltimately, why wouldn&#39;t you want to write actual sentences?  I like\nJava a lot, but English was my first language.\n\n-Kevin\n\nOn Wed, 5 Jan 2005 10:25:36 -0700, Mike Clark &lt;mike@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Have you tried communicating what a test method is intended to do in\n&gt; the name of the test method itself?
