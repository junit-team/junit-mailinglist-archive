I am one of the very few<br/>\npeople in the organization to know about this & want to share Junit&#39;s<br/>\nfeatures & advantages with others & convince them of its use. I have tested<br/>\nsome Java programs with Junit. I gave a presentation to my managar, to see<br/>\nif we can pilot the use of Junit in some project.<br/>\n<br/>\nCan someone tell me the real advantages of using Junit over the<br/>\nindividual&#39;s own Unit testing of the Java Code written by him. I have been<br/>\nreading the articles posted on Junit homepage. Where can I find more<br/>\narticles giving the advantages of Junit.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks & Regards<br/>\nArathi<br/>\n<br/>\n-----------------------Disclaimer------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nThe views of the author may not necessarily reflect those<br/>\nof the Company.
