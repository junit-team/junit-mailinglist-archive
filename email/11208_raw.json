Thanks.\n&gt; \n&gt; One more basic question.\n&gt; \n&gt; How is unit testing different from component testing.\n&gt; Let me clarify. Here the component is not something\n&gt; like COM, but a set of C functions with some exposed\n&gt; APIs. Testing includes testing these interfaces and\n&gt; functionality implemented by this component through\n&gt; these set of C functions.\n\nA unit test is whatever you want it to be. I am told that the IEEE \ndefinition of &quot;unit&quot; is so vague as to be useless.\n\nSince I program mainly in OO languages, I test objects. That means that \nI fix one object (class) to test, then simulate all its collaborators. I \nonly test one object at a time. If you have a group of functions that \nall operate on a common parameter, then they are /essentially/ the same \nas methods on a class, and so testing those functions by simulating \nevery other function they might invoke constitutes object testing.\n\nI occasionally test multiple objects at once. When I do, this is \nintegration testing: writing a test that exercises multiple \nproduction-quality objects collaborating with one another. If you test a \nfunction and allow it to invoke the real implementations of the other \nfunctions it uses, then I call that integration testing.\n\nI /suppose/ that if a component is an implementation of a single \ninterface, /and/ if you simulate any of the other components with which \nit collaborates, then testing that component would be equivalent to \nobject testing.\n\n&gt; Currently the way I test these by writing some test\n&gt; stubs. If it is advantageous to move to cppunit/junit\n&gt; I would love to do so. Please note that the developer\n&gt; of these components is not me.\n\nSince you&#39;re working in C, you might want to just start with this:\n\nTestDriver.c\n\nint main(int argc, char** argv) {\n     void* result = invokeYourFunction(parameter1, parameter2);\n     if (compare(expectedResult, result) != 0) {\n         return -1;\n     }\n\n     return 0;\n}\n\nThis is a simple test driver that tries to invoke one of your functions \nwith a set of inputs and returns a result. It then compares the result \nto the result you expect, &quot;failing&quot; if they don&#39;t match and &quot;passing&quot; if \nthey do. Write your first test in a similar way. Then another. Then \nanother. Refactor out the common bits of the test driver. After about \nten tests you&#39;ll have a fully working framework of your own to use and love.\n\nThat is, of course, if there&#39;s no good C-Unit implementation. Maybe \nthere is. Ask Google.\n-- \nJ. B. Rainsberger,\nDiaspar Software Services\nhttp://www.diasparsoftware.com :: +1 416 791-8603\nLet&#39;s write software that people understand\n\n",
