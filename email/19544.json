Would it handle your current situation?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; As Cedric pointed out, this only works if a test is a member of only one<br/>\n&gt; group.  As so many others do, many of my tests are annotated to be in<br/>\n&gt; multiple groups.  For instance, &quot;nightly&quot; and &quot;quick&quot; and &quot;bug&quot; meaning<br/>\n&gt; &quot;I want CruiseControl to run this test every night.  Also, this test is<br/>\n&gt; quick (and is therefore suitable for our continuous build).  Finally,<br/>\n&gt; this test illustrates a bug which is not yet fixed.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I agree your situation requires multiple groups.  It also seems that<br/>\nChristian&#39;s original need can be met with what&#39;s currently in the<br/>\ncurrent version of junit + cpsuite, without waiting for this<br/>\ndiscussion to complete, so that seems worth pointing out.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; So, questions for the community:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 1) Should something like ClasspathSuite be incorporated into JUnit?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I believe so.  I certainly need functionality like that and currently<br/>\n&gt; have to go to an extension to get it.  Assuming there are many other<br/>\n&gt; people in the same boat, why not build it right in?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I myself use cpsuite on enough projects that I&#39;m very tempted to build<br/>\nit in.  On the other hand, Johannes has done a great job responding to<br/>\nbug reports and feature requests on cpsuite: it&#39;s certainly more<br/>\nmature than if we had built it ourselves and maintained it at our<br/>\ncurrent pace.  We&#39;ll look at it for 4.5.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; 2) Should something like JUnitExt&#39;s categories be<br/>\n&gt; &gt; incorporated into JUnit?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Yes, especially if it allows you to annotate a test case - and<br/>\n&gt; preferably even a test method - as being a member of multiple groupings.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 3) If yes to the above, what should the API look like?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; As far as the categories go, I would like to see a simple method-level<br/>\n&gt; annotation that looks like this:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; @TestGroups={&quot;nightly&quot;, &quot;quick&quot;, &quot;bug&quot;}<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Any takers on identifying categories with classes?<br/>\n<br/>\n@TestGroups({Nightly.class, Quick.class, Bug.class})<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m thinking:<br/>\n<br/>\n- auto-completion<br/>\n- refactoring<br/>\n- easy hook for running (just run Nightly.class to get the Nightly build)<br/>\n- easy place for further customization (@BeforeClass, @AfterClass, etc)<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\n<br/>\n   David Saff</div>",
