You can test &quot;setX&quot; \n&gt; by calling it, and verify that the result of &quot;getX&quot; changed.  [This is \n&gt; just an example.  Testing get and set methods is typically a waste of \n&gt; time.  I&#39;ll assume that your void-return-method does something *non-\n&gt; trivial* and useful.]\n\nA popular myth. I&#39;ve lost count of how many bugs I&#39;ve found in set and \nget methods, as well as other methods that were &quot;too simple to fail.&quot;\n\nRemember, even if such a method is simple today it may not be tomorrow. \nOne big reason we use set and get methods instead of direct field access \nis precisely because the implementation may change. What merely sets a \nvariable today may write into a database tomorrow, or verify an \nadditional constraint. Writing test code for setters and getters insures \nthat the code still works as originally anticipated as it becomes more \ncomplex in the future. It&#39;s easier to write the test code when the \nimplementation is simple and predictable than when it is more complex.\n\n-- \n﻿Elliotte Rusty Harold  elharo@...\nXML in a Nutshell 3rd Edition Just Published!\nhttp://www.cafeconleche.org/books/xian3/\nhttp://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0596007647/cafeaulaitA/ref=nosim\n\n",
