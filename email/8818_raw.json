In general it worked fine. However\n&gt; every\n&gt; now and then (depending on user actions and what else the machine has\n&gt; running) we&#39;d run into the problems &quot;Missed notification&quot; and &quot;Early\n&gt; notification&quot; which are described in thread books such as Paul Hyde&#39;s\n&gt; &quot;Java\n&gt; Thread Programming&quot;. Solutions to these &quot;standard&quot; problems are also given\n&gt; in the thread books so we have now solved the problem.\n&gt; \n&gt; What we do not have is a test that tells us that we&#39;ve solved the problem!\n&gt; We only have tests that generally pass even when the problem is there!\n&gt; \n&gt; We would like to write a test that specifically tests our wait()-notify()\n&gt; constructs for robustness against &quot;Missed notification&quot; and &quot;Early\n&gt; notification&quot;. Has anybody already though through how best to test this?\n&gt; Or\n&gt; does anyone have a reference to an article or web where this test may be\n&gt; described in a generic way or with an example?\n\nIn my book: &quot;Unit Testing in Java - How Tests Drive the Code&quot;\n(http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1558608680) I tackle the very problem you describe\nin chapter 11. I show a way to detect the problem in certain situations. \n\nHowever, the inherent indeterminism requires a lot of effort to come up with\nsuch a test suite. In most situations it&#39;s probably more effective to  have\nthe multi-threaded code reviewed by expeprienced &quot;thread programmers&quot;. Even\nbetter: Use threading libraries (eg the one described in Doug Lea&#39;s seminal\nwork &quot;Concurrent Programming in Java&quot;)  which hide most of the intricacies of\nthreaded programming.\n\nJohannes\n\n-- \n+++ GMX - Mail, Messaging & more  http://www.gmx.net +++\n\nJetzt ein- oder umsteigen und USB-Speicheruhr als Pr�mie sichern!\n\n\n",
