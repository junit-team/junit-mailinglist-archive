Should test scenarios for A or B cover what may \n&gt; happen in C ? If so, is it just accepted as a code management \n&gt; overhead to ensure that C is properly tested via tests for A or B ?\n&gt; \n\nWas the class in question designed through the application of TDD?  If so,\nwhat is C doing that is extra to what A and B need, and therefore covered by\ntheir tests?\n\nI hope you can forgive me the extravagance of quoting myself from last\nmonth:\n\nTest First means that very few of my methods are private, and I really don&#39;t\nsee this as a bad thing.  (Most of the ones that are private are there only\nbecause that&#39;s what Eclipses&#39; Extract Method refactoring does).\n\nNB:  That is not the same as making private methods public for testing\npurposes.  That should be avoided at all costs.\n\nRegards,\nShaun.\n\n",
