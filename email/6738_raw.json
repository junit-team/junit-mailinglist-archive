I chose to just ignore that and answer it.\n&gt;Most of the People Who Know on here would give a pretty similar \n&gt;answer anyway (which includes J.B.)\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\nI&#39;m responsible for letting this message through.  I approved it.  Being \na moderator is always a little tricky.  If I err, it&#39;s on the side of \nnot censoring enough.  In this case, I had been traveling and behind on \nreading the list, so I didn&#39;t have a history of recent postings.  I also \nfigured that any responses would be similar to a response from J.B., and \nI wanted the original poster (and this list) to experience that.  As \nsuch, I chose not to censor it and rather let it run its course.  In \nhindsight, here&#39;s the response I should have made earlier...\n\nI&#39;d highly recommend that everyone listen to what J.B. has to say here. \n His advice comes from practical experience and far exceeds the amount \nyou pay for it.  If you don&#39;t want replies from him, then I suggest you \neither don&#39;t post questions here or learn to ignore his replies.  In any \nevent, be prepared for a response because he&#39;s here to help like \neveryone else.  If you don&#39;t agree with something he says, then I&#39;d \nencourage you to challenge him in a professional manner.  \n\nI, for one, consider this community very fortunate to have J.B. as a \nvolunteer.  Indeed, I place a high value on his insights and \ncontributions.  My actions as a moderator in this case should in no way \nbe taken as a reflection of my opinions of J.B.  My sincere apologies \nfor any confusion this may have caused.       \n\nIn the meantime, I&#39;m putting myself on notice...\n\nMike\n\n-- \nMike Clark\nhttp://clarkware.com\n(720) 851-2014\n\n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n",
