Feel free to pitch in to make it better.<br/>\n<br/>\n----<br/>\n<br/>\nQ: What&#39;s the difference between a failure and an error?<br/>\n<br/>\nA:<br/>\n<br/>\nAssertions are used to check for the possibility of failures, therefore <br/>\nfailures are anticipated.  In the following example, the <br/>\nIndexOutOfBoundsException is expected and checked with an assertion.  If <br/>\nthe expected exception is not raised, then a failure is produced.  <br/>\n<br/>\n    public void testExceptionExpected() {<br/>\n      try {<br/>\n      <br/>\n        new ArrayList(10).get( 11 );<br/>\n        fail(&quot;Should have thrown IndexOutOfBoundsException&quot; );<br/>\n      <br/>\n      } catch (IndexOutOfBoundsException success) {}<br/>\n    }<br/>\n<br/>\nErrors are unanticipated problems resulting in uncaught exceptions being <br/>\npropagated from a test method.  In the following example, the <br/>\nIndexOutOfBoundsException is not expected. The JUnit framework produces <br/>\nan error if the IndexOutOfBoundsException, or any other unchecked <br/>\nexception, is raised.  <br/>\n<br/>\n    public void testExceptionUnexpected() throws IndexOutOfBoundsException {<br/>\n<br/>\n      new ArrayList( 10 ).get( 11 );<br/>\n<br/>\n    }<br/>\n<br/>\nBoth failures and errors will cause the test to fail.  However, it is <br/>\nuseful to differentiate between failures and errors because the <br/>\ndebugging process is slightly different.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIn the first example, the use of fail() will not generate a complete <br/>\nstack trace including the method that raised the exception.  In this <br/>\ncase that&#39;s sufficient since we anticipate that the exception will be <br/>\nraised.  If it&#39;s not raised, then it&#39;s a problem with the test itself.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIn the second example,  the JUnit framework catches the exception and <br/>\ngenerates an error with a complete stack trace for the exception.  Since <br/>\nwe don&#39;t expect this exception to be raised, a complete stack trace is <br/>\nuseful in debugging why it was raised.<br/>\n<br/>\n----<br/>\n<br/>\nThoughts?<br/>\n<br/>\nMike<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",
