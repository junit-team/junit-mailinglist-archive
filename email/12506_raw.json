I&#39;m willing to accept that it is a problem \n&gt; with me\n&gt; rather than JUnit.  Is there something about my outlook on testing that \n&gt; I need\n&gt; to refine?  I am surprised that data driven testing like this is not \n&gt; supported,\n&gt; as it seems like soemthign that would be used a lot.  What is the reasoning\n&gt; behind JUnit not beign designed for this, and is there soemthign that I \n&gt; can do\n&gt; to acheive what I want while still keeping with JUnit&#39;s design goals.\n\nYou&#39;re welcome to feel that way; I won&#39;t press the issue anymore. It&#39;s \nentirely possible that all the very smart people who&#39;ve been working \nwith JUnit since 1999 have missed what you&#39;ll eventually figure out. I \nhave to allow for that possibility. Still, if I were you, I think I \nmight take some stock in what someone with experience has to say.\n\nThat said, highly data-driven testing /is/ supported by JUnit, as long \nas you don&#39;t care about how it reports tests in test runs. You could \nsimply write this test:\n\ntestAlgorithm\n     data = some array\n     foreach (item in data)\n         doTest(item)\n\nThis works just fine, except:\n\n1. If the algorithm fails for the 5th row of data, you&#39;ll never know \nwhat happens with the 6th row, because the test will fail\n\n2. Although you&#39;re really running n tests, JUnit will report it as only 1.\n\nIf you don&#39;t care about these so-called limitations, then you&#39;re done.\n\nNow you /can/ run all your test*() methods for each row in a List of \nfixture objects, but I don&#39;t want to get into the details of how until I \nhave time to sit down and write an article about it. Today&#39;s not the day.\n\nFinally, you were earlier talking about something like instantiating and \nrunning a test from some other test. JUnit /definitely/ don&#39;t work that \nway. Don&#39;t even bother. Tests do not run other tests; that&#39;s why we have \ntest runners.\n\n&gt;  &gt; This is a different problem from the one you described before, so it&#39;s a\n&gt;  &gt; different one from what I tried to help you solve.\n&gt; \n&gt; Yes, that is why I tried to describe it better.  I really appreciate \n&gt; your taking\n&gt; the time to understand what I am saying and help me.  I bought your book\n&gt; yesterday and I plan to read it over the holidays.\n&gt; Alright I will look into FitNesse like you suggested.  But I still feel like\n&gt; there is either an issue with JUnit or my understanding of it since I \n&gt; failed to\n&gt; make this work.\n\nUnderstand that what I&#39;m about to say is a little harsh, but it&#39;s true. \nI hope we&#39;re all mature enough to take it in the spirit in which it&#39;s given:\n\n  * A sign of maturity in any profession is when we recognize the \nlimitations of tools and work around them, often by finding better \ntools. To try hopelessly to reshape every problem so that one tool \nsolves it is wishful thinking. It&#39;s a phase we all go through and have \nto get through.\n\nFour years ago, I was you, hoping that JUnit would do everything \nincluding massage my feet when I was tired.\n\nI hope Fit/FitNesse helps you solve the problem in a nicer way. If not, \nthen just wait for my next recipe: &quot;Parameterized Test Suite&quot;. :)\n\nTake care.\n-- \nJ. B.
