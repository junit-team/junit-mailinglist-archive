I jumped to my guns\n&gt; too quickly.\n\n\nThanks f=\r\nor posting this rectification, Joakim, I appreciate.\n\nLook, I&#39;m trying to b=\r\nuild a bridge here.\n\nOn one hand, we have a small (very small) population o=\r\nf people who&#39;ve put\ntesting at the forefront of every single engineering ta=\r\nsk they undertake\nevery day at the exclusion of anything else.\n\nOn the othe=\r\nr hand, we have the &quot;rest of the world&quot;, which is slowly waking\nup to the v=\r\nalues of automated testing but is also dealing with massive code\nbases that=\r\n were not only *not* designed for automated testing, but for which\nautomate=\r\nd testing might simply be impossible to implement (and yes, I can\ncome up w=\r\nith a few examples that will make the most radical TDD\npractitioners go ver=\r\ny humble).\n\nI don&#39;t have anything to sell here.  I&#39;m not a consultant, I do=\r\nn&#39;t get paid\nif you use TestNG or if you do more automated testing.  But I&#39;=\r\nve worked on\nboth sides of the fence:  I love testing, I like TDD to a cert=\r\nain extent,\nbut I&#39;m also seeing a few flaws and gaps in reality between wha=\r\nt I read and\nthe rest of the industry, and because of that, I feel that I c=\r\nan offer a\nperspective that both sides can relate to.\n\nWhen somebody posts =\r\non this mailing-list asking for help because they can&#39;t\nfollow to the lette=\r\nr principles explained in extreme books, I feel as a\npersonal obligation to=\r\n tell them &quot;It&#39;s okay, let&#39;s take it one step at a\ntime&quot;.\n\nSoon, I&#39;ll post =\r\na few additional thoughts on where I see limitations (and\nsometimes flaws) =\r\nin TDD and code coverage, and I have no doubt that some of\nyou will choose =\r\nto interpret that as &quot;Cedric hates TDD&quot; and &quot;Cedric doesn&#39;t\nbelieve in code=\r\n coverage&quot; but I hope the rest of you will see beyond that\nand use these ar=\r\nguments to make educated decisions on when and where to use\nthe best tool f=\r\nor your job.\n\nBecause the truth is that there is no silver bullet to write =\r\ngood code, and\nyou should be very skeptical of anyone who is trying to conv=\r\nince you\notherwise.\n\n-- \nC=E9dric\nhttp://testng.org\n\n\n[Non-text portions of=\r\n this message have been removed]\n\n\n",
