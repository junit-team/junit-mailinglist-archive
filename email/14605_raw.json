Even in Sun&#39;s libraries, there are public classes and\n&gt; methods in com.sun packages, which per convention aren&#39;t *published*. If you\n&gt; use them, you do so at your own peril.\n\n\nAnd guess what? People use them, even though they aren&#39;t supposed to. \nEven major projects by really good developers when should know better \nuse them. For instance, until the very latest version Xerces directly \naccessed sun.io classes. Hell, I even wrote a book whose primary focus \nwas on documenting, explaining, and teaching people to use the sun classes!\n\nIf gentlemen&#39;s agreements were sufficient to enforce constraints on \nusage, we never would have had to invent access protection in the first \nplace. public == published in Java. I certainly wish it were otherwise, \nbut sadly that&#39;s not the case.\n\n-- \n﻿Elliotte Rusty Harold  elharo@...\nXML in a Nutshell 3rd Edition Just Published!\nhttp://www.cafeconleche.org/books/xian3/\nhttp://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0596007647/cafeaulaitA/ref=nosim\n\n",
