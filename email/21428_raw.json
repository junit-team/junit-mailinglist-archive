I work at a company that makes Medical Devices. The\n&gt;=\r\n FDA, as we&#39;re told by QA, requires the deposition of all tests. So even\n&gt; =\r\nPass&#39;ing tests must have their actual results reported on. We do this\n&gt; cur=\r\nrently with manual/human tests.\n&gt;\n&gt; If the report could say something like:=\r\n\n&gt; Test ID Status Expected Actual\n&gt; 123 Pass Smith Smith\n&gt; 456 Pass Value &gt;=\r\n 10 12\n&gt; 789 Fail Value =3D &quot;abc&quot; xyz\n&gt; ...\n&gt;\n&gt; This report would be stored=\r\n (for many years) for audit purposes.\n&gt;\n&gt; Now being a newbie, maybe there i=\r\ns a way to do this I don&#39;t know about -\n&gt; but very useful.\n&gt;\n&gt; Mark\n&gt;\n&gt; ---=\r\n In junit@yahoogroups.com &lt;junit%40yahoogroups.com&gt;, &quot;toalexsmail&quot;\n&gt; &lt;toale=\r\nxsmail@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; --- In junit@yahoogroups.com &lt;junit%40yahoogroup=\r\ns.com&gt;, Robert Wenner\n&gt; &lt;robert.wenner@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; On Monday 09 Ju=\r\nne 2008 21:18, C=E9dric Beust wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If I have to go through umpt=\r\neen thousand lines of log, I may as\n&gt; well\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; test everything manual=\r\nly.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Nobody says you have to, but the fact that your tests p=\r\nass doesn&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; guarantee that you are testing what you think you are t=\r\nesting.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Well. If the log is important, I have to go through it,=\r\n or I miss\n&gt; &gt; &gt; something important. If it is not important (and I don&#39;t h=\r\nave to go\n&gt; &gt; &gt; through it) I can skip it altogether. So what do you mean w=\r\nhen you\n&gt; &gt; say I\n&gt; &gt; &gt; don&#39;t have to go through it?\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I have r=\r\nead carefully all the posts so far and I tend to agree with\n&gt; &gt; Robert. I a=\r\nm wonder whether I miss something important too.\n&gt; &gt; I want to be clear, so=\r\n I will take one step backward. What is the MAIN\n&gt; &gt; purpose of JUnit? The =\r\nanswer is to be able to write AUTOMATIC unit\n&gt; &gt; test. Unit test should be =\r\nwritten is the correct way, that is\n&gt; &gt; correctly design. This has nothing =\r\nto do with logging. Making unit\n&gt; &gt; test AUTOMATIC contradict using logging=\r\n.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;you can skip the this paragraph&gt;\n&gt; &gt; I want to step aside for a =\r\nwhile. Let assume that you&#39;re not using\n&gt; &gt; JUnit at all and write small ma=\r\nin function to test. I don&#39;t want to\n&gt; &gt; counter why you shouldn&#39;t do this,=\r\n let focus on what tools you do use\n&gt; &gt; in this approach. In the most cases=\r\n you will add System.out both to\n&gt; &gt; the code and to the main. If you&#39;re us=\r\ning C++, for instance, you will\n&gt; &gt; use preprocessor to switch on or off th=\r\nese output to the console. More\n&gt; &gt; advance option will be to use logging m=\r\nechanism and to change it\n&gt; &gt; configuration depends on the environment your=\r\n program run (that is to\n&gt; &gt; turn on many of your log statement only in dev=\r\nelopment). Everything is\n&gt; &gt; great until your program is actually fails. Ag=\r\nain, from the experience\n&gt; &gt; it is almost always the case that existing Sys=\r\ntem.outs are not enough,\n&gt; &gt; that you need more information or you should a=\r\ndd some more output\n&gt; &gt; early in the code. So, in this point you have to op=\r\ntion to run your\n&gt; &gt; program AGAIN with debugger or to add more System.outs=\r\n and to run it\n&gt; &gt; as is. In both cases it can be the case that you should =\r\nrerun your\n&gt; &gt; program again (if you use debugger you could simply not poin=\r\nted out\n&gt; &gt; when some data changed and in the System.out case you can figur=\r\ne out\n&gt; &gt; that you need more System.outs).\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; From the paragraph above=\r\n one should conclude that when one write unit\n&gt; &gt; test there is 2 different=\r\n phases. First is to write them down in the\n&gt; &gt; hope that everything will b=\r\ne ok (it doesn&#39;t mean, that you design\n&gt; &gt; should be poor or you shouldn&#39;t =\r\nsupply appropriate messages to assert\n&gt; &gt; statements etc) and the second ph=\r\nase is to rerun your test if your\n&gt; &gt; test fails. Lets see how logging will=\r\n help you.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; In the first phase I see the only purpose using logs is =\r\nfor &#39;sanity\n&gt; &gt; check&#39; that is to ensure that you actually test what your t=\r\nhink is you\n&gt; &gt; test. If you want to make something more than just &#39;sanity =\r\ncheck&#39; you\n&gt; &gt; should write unit test to your unit test, that is pretty sil=\r\nly.\n&gt; &gt; Moreover, you need to make such &#39;sanity check&#39; only when you actual=\r\nly\n&gt; &gt; write this test. For this purpose logging is appropriate approach, I=\r\nMHO.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; In the second phase, when you rerun your unit test when it fai=\r\nls, you\n&gt; &gt; should consider to add more assert statement and more clearly\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; diagnostic messages first. When you done and you don&#39;t see how to\n&gt; &gt; im=\r\nprove the design (recall I consider that design is correct) you can\n&gt; &gt; add=\r\n log statement manually. But in this case they will not be part of\n&gt; &gt; new =\r\nmechanism, because no more asserts will be added. So this new\n&gt; &gt; feature w=\r\nill not be in use!\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Using logging in the assert statement ONLY for &#39;=\r\nsanity check&#39; is\n&gt; &gt; overkill, I think. As for me I make such &#39;sanity check=\r\n&#39; in the\n&gt; &gt; following way. First of all, I use log4j MANUALLY that is as a=\r\nddition\n&gt; &gt; to JUnit asserts. They don&#39;t duplicate what asserts does they s=\r\nupply\n&gt; &gt; additional information, such as what assertion was already done. =\r\nIn\n&gt; &gt; this case when assertion will fail afterwards I can look on the log =\r\nto\n&gt; &gt; see in what part of unit test it happened and what tests passed. I g=\r\no\n&gt; &gt; even further and use JDK 1.4 assert statement to document\n&gt; &gt; precond=\r\nition, postcondition and invariants both in the code and in the\n&gt; &gt; unit te=\r\nst.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The bottom line is that I see the sense using logs as a COMPLET=\r\nION to\n&gt; &gt; the JUnit and only for &#39;sanity check&#39;. This use is not duplicate=\r\ns\n&gt; &gt; JUnit assert statements and could be written manually.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\n\n=\r\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n",
