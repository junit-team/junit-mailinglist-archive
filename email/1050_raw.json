(I haven&#39;t used the cvs task - we \nhave Source Safe here, but I don&#39;t suppose that it&#39;s too difficult to set up.)\n\nIf you&#39;re using a database, as you almost certainly are, things get more \ncomplicated ;) Some possible options:\n* Someone here (I forget who) posted a &quot;MockResultSet&quot; class that can be \nused to fake database results - I think it&#39;s available on the Yahoo groups \nweb page somewhere.\n* You could set up a script (also executed by ant?) that creates some fake \ntables in your database and populates them with data, which you could then \ntest against. (You have got a test database, right?) Once the tests have \nbeen run, you could then execute a seperate script to clean up.\n\nIf anyone has any other suggestions I&#39;d love to hear them - this is a \nproblem that I&#39;ve come up against more than once...\n\n(If you decide to use ant, and are not sure how to use it, feel free to \nmail me).\n\nHTH,\nJim\n\n\n--\n\n                           *   Jim Cheesman   *\n             Trabajo: \njchees@... - (34)(91) 724 9200 x 2360\n               Personal: \nmogrim@...
