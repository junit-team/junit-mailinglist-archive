So you will start to have a\nclient part that calls your URL, parses the XML and display the result.\nAll is fine but then you also want to be able to execute the test from\nany of the existing JUnit integration tools (from IDEs, using Ant junit\ntask, etc). So you will transform your client side into a TestCase so\nthat it can be run by any test runner ...\n\n... and this is Cactus ! :-)\n\nTo summarise :\n\n- yes Cactus can be a simple as what you describe (this is actually a\nfeature of version 1.4, which is not released yet - but soon to be)\n\n- it allow for more should you need it\n\n- it is documented and there are resources on Cactus : website + books +\narticles\n\n- BTW, Cactus integrates completely with Ant to automated start up and\nshutdown of application servers\n\n&lt;/biased&gt;\n\nYes, I am the original author of Cactus and thus I am biased :-) but as\na user I would always go with existing framework if I find any that\nperform what I want. For example, I wouldn&#39;t dare write my logging\nframework, MVC controller one, XML to Java mapping one, etc.\n\nIn the end it is your choice. I&#39;m just writing this email so that you\nknow Cactus does what you want and that you shouldn&#39;t skip it because\nyou think it doesn&#39;t.\n\nCheers,\n-Vincent\n\n&gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; From: Michael Rettig [mailto:mrettig@...]\n&gt; Sent: 13 July 2002 02:45\n&gt; To: junit@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Subject: RE: [junit] Testing a class inside an Application Server\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; From: &quot;Nicholas Lesiecki&quot; &lt;nick@...&gt;\n&gt; &gt; What you describe sounds very similar to Cactus:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; http://jakarta.apache.org/cactus/\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Have you looked at it?\n&gt; \n&gt; Yes, and what I&#39;m describing is far simpler than Cactus. There is no\n&gt; framework to speak of. Just a servlet that knows how to run a test\nsuite\n&gt; and return the results as xml. For instance, you would pass this URL\nto\n&gt; your browser to run the tests in a remote app server.\n&gt; \n&gt; http://localhost:8080/junit?classname=com.package.test.TestCase\n&gt; \n&gt; It is very simple, but powerful. Since the test executes within the\n&gt; servlet container you can access all the facilities of the app server.\n&gt; We&#39;ve also automated the startup and shutdown of the app server, so\nthe\n&gt; entire test process is completely scripted. This makes it simple to\nplug\n&gt; the whole process into our cruise control build process.\n&gt; \n&gt; Mike\n&gt; --\n&gt; __________________________________________________________\n&gt; \n&gt; Sign-up for your own FREE Personalized E-mail at Mail.com\n&gt; \n&gt; http://www.mail.com/?sr=signup\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Save up to $160 by signing up for NetZero Platinum Internet service.\n&gt; \n&gt; http://www.netzero.net/?refcd=N2P0602NEP8\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ------------------------ Yahoo!
