The tool would stop as soon as it<br/>\nreach the ceiling and suggest that the method be<br/>\nbroken down further.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers,<br/>\nOle<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- &quot;James P.

The<br/>\n&gt; system would not <br/>\n&gt; produce the test case:<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; a = new Point(0, 0);<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; b = new Point(3, 4);<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; assertEquals(5, a.distanceTo(b));<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; instead (since, in my example I coded the wrong<br/>\n&gt; distance function) it <br/>\n&gt; would produce:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; assertEquals(7, a.distance(b));<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; and the test would pass.  So I would have to<br/>\n&gt; manually check every <br/>\n&gt; passing test case to make sure that it was valid.<br/>\n&gt; Bummer.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I would need be able to add something like:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; //** Test Point(0,0), Point(3,4), 5.0 **//<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; as a guide to the test generator as to what was<br/>\n&gt; expected. Then, in <br/>\n&gt; addition to all the other valuable verification<br/>\n&gt; tests of corner cases, <br/>\n&gt; etc.; it could generate the validation test.  In our<br/>\n&gt; lexicon, <br/>\n&gt; verification tests demonstrate that whatever the<br/>\n&gt; software is doing, it <br/>\n&gt; is doing correctly. Validation tests confirm that<br/>\n&gt; the software is doing <br/>\n&gt; the correct thing.  Using both, we confirm that it<br/>\n&gt; is both doing the <br/>\n&gt; right thing, and doing it correctly.  Automated test<br/>\n&gt; generation is <br/>\n&gt; excellent for verification, the question becomes how<br/>\n&gt; to we generate <br/>\n&gt; validation tests as well, without overloading the<br/>\n&gt; programmer.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Perhaps, at this point, it is sufficient to automate<br/>\n&gt; the verification <br/>\n&gt; tests, and leave the validation up to the developer.<br/>\n&gt; Possibly, with a <br/>\n&gt; structured requirements document, we could extract<br/>\n&gt; data for validation, <br/>\n&gt; and automate that as well?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Just rambling,<br/>\n&gt; Jim<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Kevin Lawrence wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; On 1/9/07, James P.

For<br/>\n&gt; &gt; simple cases, like your distance between two<br/>\n&gt; points example, the tool<br/>\n&gt; &gt; could show some examples like<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; a = new Point(0, 0);<br/>\n&gt; &gt; b = new Point(3, 4);<br/>\n&gt; &gt; assertEquals(5, a.distanceTo(b));<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; and have the developer review the cases it<br/>\n&gt; generates. This would get<br/>\n&gt; &gt; tedious quite quickly for methods with complex<br/>\n&gt; arguments though.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Kevin<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; www.junitfactory.com<br/>\n&gt; &gt; You send us code.
