More than 200\nregistrants have already taken advantage of this special discount.  We have\ndecided to extend the super-early bird registration deadline.  The final\ndeadline for this savings opportunity is this Friday, June 3rd.\n\nThe Agile2005 Conference will be held at the Denver Marriott City Center July\n24-29. We are offering a special discounted rate of $1499 through the\nSuper-Early Bird date of June 3rd.  Members of the AgileAlliance, ACM, or IEEE\nare eligible for a rate of $1399.  The academic rate is $549 until June 3rd.\nPlease act quickly to ensure that you take advantage of these special rates, a\nsignificant savings over the Just-In-Time rate of $1799.\n\nThe merger of XP Agile Universe with the Agile Development Conference has\nresulted in a record number of submissions and a very strong program.  We have\nan excellent collection of tutorials, workshops, experience reports and research\npapers.  Some of the tutorial and workshop presenters include Jim Highsmith, Ken\nSchwaber, Ron Jeffries, Mary Poppendieck, Rebecca Wirfs-Brock and many more.\nBob Martin and Brian Marick will be giving a keynote presentation.  Our fellows\nthis year are Tim Lister, Ward Cunningham and Kent Beck.\n\nFor conference agenda, session descriptions and on-line registration go to\nwww.agile2005.org\n\n\n\n\n",
