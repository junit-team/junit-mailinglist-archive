The most\nobvious reason I can think of is to hide the method from a client class.\nIf I want to test a method that is private, I usually decide to make it\nprotected.  That is the easiest and fastest way.  If I still need to\nhave the method private in order to hide it from clients, I go with an\ninterface.  In that case I can make sure that the client only uses what\nI want to be seen and I am free in the implementation class to have a\nmore liberal visibility of methods.\n\n \n\nAndreas\n\n \n\n \n\n________________________________\n\nFrom: junit@yahoogroups.com [mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com] On Behalf Of\nIlja Preuss\nSent: Sunday, July 23, 2006 10:18 PM\nTo: junit@yahoogroups.com\nSubject: Re: [junit] How to Test Private Methods Inside a Class\n\n \n\nOle Ersoy wrote:\n\n&gt; The file loading part is in a private method, because\n&gt; the load routine is specific to the class that is\n&gt; being tested, and is therefore not useful in a utility\n&gt; library.\n\nReusability is not the only reason to extract things into their own \nclasses, is it?\n\n&gt; So I just wanted to put the load routine in a private\n&gt; method and test it there, then call it from the public\n&gt; method.\n\nWould putting it into its own class have had any negative effect?\n\nCan you show us the load routine?\n\nCurious, Ilja\n\n \n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\n\n",
