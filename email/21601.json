I need to execute an arbitrary<br/>\nset of test methods (using @test annotations) against a known -- but not yet<br/>\nexistent at JUnit launch time -- set of classes. Those classes are generated<br/>\nand compiled in a previous test case within same session and then need to be<br/>\nloaded dynamically. Ideally, I would present the name of classes as Strings;<br/>\nI understand that JUnit has a way to do this dynamically for method names<br/>\nbut I can&#39;t find a similar feature for class names -- everything I&#39;ve tried<br/>\nends up forcing me to have an explicit compiled reference at test harness<br/>\nlaunch time.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd of course I&#39;d really like not to have to write my own runner<br/>\nimplementation. ;) In TestNG I can do this with factories but our build<br/>\nenvironment currently only supports JUnit.<br/>\n<br/>\nMiles<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Wed, May 13, 2009 at 4:23 AM, Johannes Link &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jl@...\">jl@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I guess your own runner implementation to use with @RunWith could do the<br/>\n&gt; trick.
