You are<br/>\ntalking about aspects in a system, which is exactly my point.  Testability,<br/>\nlike logging, is a cross-cutting aspect of the application, not part of the<br/>\nobjects being modeled.  You say it&#39;s easier or your preference to represent<br/>\ntestability as addtional mixed in methods here and there in the objects.  I<br/>\ndon&#39;t like that.  But it seems like it&#39;s a matter of taste.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; So now, always, testability is high on my list of things I consider when<br/>\n&gt; I design any system. I usually am expected to provide some way of showing,<br/>\n&gt; on a continuous basis, that the system will do what&#39;s expected of it, so<br/>\n&gt; it&#39;s really almost a final function of the system in the same way that<br/>\n&gt; the behaviour the client is looking for is a final function of it.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I think we agree here.  We just disagree about how testability should be<br/>\nrepresented in an object oriented system.  This is an interesting general<br/>\nproblem for which we need some general principles.  Anyone else have<br/>\nthoughts on how to implement or represent &quot;testability?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nScott S.</div>",
