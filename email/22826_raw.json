This morning suddenly when I run a tes=\r\nt class with &quot;Run as JUnit Test&quot;, Eclipse reports &quot;No JUnit tests found&quot;.\n\n=\r\nI can still run individual test methods normally.  The problem happens when=\r\n I run the test class, and it happens with all test classes in the project,=\r\n except one.  When I run the entire test directory tree, JUnit executes one=\r\n of the classes in the middle of the directory tree normally, then stops wi=\r\nth no other messages.  I can run that one test class normally.  I can&#39;t fin=\r\nd any difference between the one that runs and the dozens that don&#39;t.  Othe=\r\nr projects continue to run JUnit normally.  Eclipse clean, refresh, and val=\r\nidate does not help.  Closing and opening the project does not help.  Delet=\r\ning the project from disk and checking it out again from my Subversion repo=\r\nsitory does not help.  When I drop back to a revision from a few days back,=\r\n all works correctly.  But I want to save and test my work since then.\n\nThi=\r\ns sounds like Eclipse metadata got corrupted, and it sounds like the corrup=\r\nted metadata gets saved to Subversion.  I haven&#39;t been able to identify an =\r\nevent or a change in my project that led to this problem.\n\nWhat metadata mi=\r\nght be involved?  If I try deleting Eclipse metadata directories, what is s=\r\nafe to throw away?\n\nThanks for any suggestions.\n\n\n",
