Due to their field positions, they will do them in different ways, but they are a team that must attack together and defend together.\n\n-------------- Original message -------------- \nFrom: &quot;Ilja Preuss&quot; &lt;preuss@...&gt; \n&gt; Perhaps a good analogy would be a basketball forward who thinks, &quot;I\n&gt; don&#39;t really need to work on my dribbling, the guards always bring up\n&gt; the ball.&quot;\n\nOr (for us Europeans ;) like a goalkeeper thinking &quot;I don&#39;t need to\ncommunicate with the defenders, I&#39;ll just catch every ball they let\nthrough.&quot;\n\nCheers, Ilja\n\n\n\n\nYAHOO!
