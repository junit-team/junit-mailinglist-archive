Say that I<br/>\n&gt;  &gt;  &gt; want to make sure all the tests are actually getting called.<br/>\n&gt;  &gt;<br/>\n&gt;  &gt;  Why wouldn&#39;t your tests be executed? Are you worried that you are<br/>\n&gt;  &gt;  building test suites incorrectly or that the test runners are broken?<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; Or<br/>\n&gt;  &gt;  is it something else?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; There are all sorts of reasons that things might not get executed. For<br/>\n&gt; one thing, I am not using the TestRunner functionality. It is not,<br/>\n&gt; actually, a requirement when using junit.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You&#39;re writing your own test runner? I see. In that case, just implement <br/>\nTestListener /or/ use the JUnit-addons test runner, which provides an <br/>\nopen test listener architecture, making it very easy to track the <br/>\nprogress of each test.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; But, also, if I am going to set up something that is going to run<br/>\n&gt; automatically for some period of time, then I will carefully check to<br/>\n&gt; confirm that it is doing exactly what I think it is doing, at least<br/>\n&gt; once.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I understand that, but, for example, if I run the Swing-based test <br/>\nrunner, I can watch the tests make progress. Once I&#39;m satisfied that <br/>\nnothing&#39;s obviously broken, I&#39;m pretty confident in the test runners. <br/>\nThe text-based one, for example, prints a dot for each test. If I don&#39;t <br/>\nsee &quot;E&quot; or &quot;F&quot;, then that test must have passed.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; It seems easy enough to add a method in junit that takes an<br/>\n&gt; OutputStream and writes verbose output to that stream.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>No need to add a method in JUnit: just implement the TestListener <br/>\ninterface. Since you&#39;re writing your own test runner, you&#39;ll have to do <br/>\nthat, anyway.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; This is sort of on general principals. If you are writing a framework,<br/>\n&gt; there needs to be a way to run the framework for maximum transparency,<br/>\n&gt; as well as a way to run them most efficiently.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>That&#39;s an interesting statement. I don&#39;t mean to contradict you, but if <br/>\nthat were such a general principal, then I&#39;d think someone else would <br/>\nhave brought that up sometime between 2000 and now.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;snip /&gt;<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Then I will write up something and submit it to the sourceforge team.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Good luck. I&#39;ll say this, though: if you would say more about what <br/>\nspecifically you&#39;re trying to achieve and why the current framework <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t do it, we might be able to suggest a solution that doesn&#39;t <br/>\nrequire more code.<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJ.
