Sure, if you&#39;re just playing around in your <br/>\nown code base with a few people, maybe you can get away with this. <br/>\nHowever, API design techniques that work well amongst friends don&#39;t <br/>\nalways scale to the audience size achieved by JUnit. If you&#39;re <br/>\ndeveloping serious library software that&#39;s intended for many thousands <br/>\nof people to use, most of  whom you&#39;ve never met and most of whom you <br/>\nnever will, then there&#39;s no middle ground.

The sun packages are one <br/>\nexample of things that really shouldn&#39;t be public, but need to be due to <br/>\nthe limitations of the language.
