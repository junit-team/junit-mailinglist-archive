I<br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t think that you can write 200+ pages about JUnit.  The chapter about <br/>\n&gt; JUnit is about 20 pages and describes how to write a test case, a suite and<br/>\n&gt; execute tests.  Nothing new if you have access to the documentation.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>One certainly could write another 100+ pages about Junit (BTW, there&#39;s<br/>\nanother chapter in the book which covers some Junit internals) but IMO<br/>\nthe general techniques are more important than the tool itself.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; What is more interesting about this book is the presentation of several <br/>\n&gt; testing methods (mock objects for ex.).  I think this book is worth reading<br/>\n&gt; but if you don&#39;t want to learn German (...) you will find plenty of other <br/>\n&gt; books written in a language you better understand.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>There *may be* an English translation sometime next year but I hope that<br/>\nother books about test first and the application of Junit will be<br/>\npublished by then. The english speaking XP community is so numerous that<br/>\neverything else would be a shame...<br/>\n<br/>\nJohannes</div>",
