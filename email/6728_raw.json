You can do it sometimes and\n&gt; not other times. I only wish that those who choose this approach\n&gt; measure the difference between the two.\n\nWell, for me the measure is pretty easy. I no longer spend ten minutes\nworking out the interface for a class only to discover that it&#39;s a nice\ninterface, but not the interface I need.\n\nIn fact, quite often these days, I find myself practicing &quot;test-second,\nimplementation-third&quot; programming. I&#39;ll be in the middle of programming\na servlet, and I&#39;ll realize I need to be able to find, say, a Foo object\nbased on the current IP address of the request. At that point, I&#39;ll just\nmake up, on the spot, the most convenient interface for that, and use\nit, even though that interface, and possibly not even the object I&#39;m\nusing, exists.\n\nAfter I&#39;ve finished coding my little routine, the actual code that gets\nand uses the foo object is written and right in front of me, so I know\nthe interface. Unfortunately, at this point I can&#39;t test because my\nFoo stuff doesn&#39;t exist. So then I code up enough of Foo (usually just\na mock object with specific behaviour) to let me test the routine I&#39;m\nworking on, and work out some way to get it into the routine I&#39;m working\non during unit testing. Now I can test the method I&#39;m working on, and\nmake any changes necessary for it to pass. (This may change the Foo\ninterface as well.) Eventually my current little bit of work is done and\ntested, even though the code it depends on doesn&#39;t even exist yet!\n\nAfter all this is done, I can then go and create the Foo thingie that\nreally should exist based on the code that uses it. So I write up tests\nbased on the code, and then code and test the Foo thingie itself.\n\nI&#39;ve found many advantages to this approach:\n\n1. It lets you concentrate on and finish one thing at a time, rather\nthan getting into a big &quot;stack&quot; of things, where you are constantly\npushing down the current activity to start a new one. This means that\nin a limited amount of time, you can complete two things rather than\nhalf-complete four, and you don&#39;t suffer from the &quot;now where was I?&quot;\nproblem when you &quot;pop the stack.&quot;\n\n2. Interfaces are worked out where they need to be worked out, in the\nusers of that interface. Speculative coding is reduced.\n\n3. When you get to testing an interface, the tests tend to be easier to\nwork out, because you&#39;ve got all the examples of how the inteface is\nused right in front of you.\n\n4. Tests are localized to particular classes and areas of code, rather\nthan depending on other classes and areas of code working correctly.\n\n5. The need for test coverage is reduced, because you can not write\ntests for functionality you never use. (This needs to be applied with\ncaution, of course; if your interface offers unused functionality and\nyou&#39;ve not tested it, someone else later might use that functionality,\nassuming it&#39;s tested, and run into bugs. But then again, it&#39;s not good\npractice for interfaces to offer functionality that&#39;s not used, anyway.)\n\nI used to be a very bottom-up programmer, but the speed and ease of this\ntop-down approach has completely converted me. I now write probably one\nhalf to one third the amount of code I used to write to get equivalant\nfunctionality in an application. My customers really appreciate this.\n\ncjs\n-- \nCurt Sampson  &lt;cjs@...&gt;   +81 90 7737 2974   http://www.netbsd.org\n    Don&#39;t you know, in this new Dark Age, we&#39;re all light.  --XTC\n\n\n",
