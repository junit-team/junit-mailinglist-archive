Thank you all. \nMy manager hasn&#39;t shot m=\r\ne (yet). If I don&#39;t post again you can guess\nwhat would have happened to me=\r\n. \n\nA few observations\n2 hours is quite high.\nI agree it looks quite high. =\r\nSome initial experiments at actually\nfinding out how much time it takes to =\r\nwrite a test method gave those\nnumbers. And, as mentioned by JBR, it is tru=\r\ne that the existing code\nwill need to be refactored for meaningful junit te=\r\nsts. So 2 hours may be\nthe closer to actuals. One of the implicit ideas was=\r\n to provide a\nbaseline model with 100% code coverage and reasonably accurat=\r\ne\ncomplexity measures for classes, so that classes can be test infected\ndep=\r\nending on the complexity and code coverage required. \nAs Bossicard pointed =\r\nout, the final consensus in our team is to start\nwith Integration tests and=\r\n write unit tests for those classes/packages\nthat throw up during integrati=\r\non testing. And, possibly use the\ncomplexity measures to find which classes=\r\n need to be tested and how much\nthey should be tested. \nDave is spot on. Da=\r\nve, we are trying to do what you have said. [You need\nto find places in the=\r\n codebase that\nwould benefit the most from adding tests and go after those =\r\nfirst.]\n\nBest regards,\nSelva.\n&quot;As small as possible. As soon as possible.&quot;\n=\r\n\n\n",
