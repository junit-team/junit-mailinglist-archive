Nice without clutter.\n\nThe original question from Mike Duffy was :\n\n&gt;The Junit.org site has an FAQ section\n&gt;(http://junit.sourceforge.net/doc/faq/faq.htm) with the following\n&gt;question: How do I implement a test case for a thrown exception?\n&gt;The answer they give is not completely correct because it does not\n&gt;account for the possiblility that another exception could be thrown.\n\nBut this is not true. The code is correct and does account for the\npossibility of another thrown exception : it will be catched by the\nframework and the test will fail (has an error). Still, the FAQ could be\nimproved by explaining this and by adding a &quot;throws Exception&quot; clause like\nthe code below, suggested by rainsber:\n\nmathieu.\n\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: Neil Swingler\n\n&gt;I use this method as well.
