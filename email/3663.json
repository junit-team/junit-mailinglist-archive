Well, we seem to have time <br/>\n&gt; to respond to trivial subjects and partake<br/>\n&gt; in what is nothing short of mental masturbation and ignore substantive <br/>\n&gt; questions that require some effort.<br/>\n&gt; I think I have read about 30 messages about getters and setters that <br/>\n&gt; sounds more like a pissing contest.  And then there is the chatter <br/>\n&gt; about one piece of spam.  How many worthless messages did this &quot;spam&quot; <br/>\n&gt; generate?  Boy we nailed that one didn&#39;t we?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; If you need someone to chat with, get a dog.
