To be able to work quickly (hot deployment with underlying \npackages is\n&gt; not really possible) we use bipolar EJB creators iso the regular EJB \nHome\n&gt; for the session EJBs. That is a factory that returns the EJB in the \nnormal\n&gt; way (created by the EJB Home) *or* as a simple local object, \ndepending on a\n&gt; property that can be specified in a config file. While developing, \nwe\n&gt; usually run the tests on the local session EJBs. Very nice for \ndebugging\n&gt; too.\n&gt; &gt;\n\nI think this is a great idea.  \n\nDoes this mean you essentially duplicate you code?  Once for the \nEJBBean class and once for your simple local object?  \n\nI did something like this in an effort to minimize client code \nchanges in my application regardless of whether I was running within \nan EJB container or not.  \n\nYou must then define a common interface between your EJB and the \nsimple local object so the the client does not care whether it gets a \nCustomer EJB Remote stub or a Customer simple local object.\n\nAlso where do you write tests that test your transaction processing.  \nI find I like to write tests against the EJB container to ensure \nthings that should get rolled back do.  I guess you can not write \nthese against your simple local objects unless your are demarking the \ntransactions yourself via BMP.\n\nThanks for sharing.\n\nJonathan\n\n\n\n\n",
