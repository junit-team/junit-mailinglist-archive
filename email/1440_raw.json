The most common objection I get \n&gt; goes along the line of &quot;what advantage will I get out of this, when \n&gt; writing my code? I have my test class, w/ its main(..) method, and \n&gt; that&#39;s all I need.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Even though people are willing to see the advantage of a unit testing \n&gt; framework for the long term project development, that want to see \n&gt; &quot;personal value&quot;.\n&gt; \n\nIf they really did have a test class that gets run frequently and \nautomatically checks its results, then they would already be \nexperiencing the personal values - more time to write code with \nconfidence.\n\nMy experience has been that the personal value of time strikes a chord \nwith most developers.  It takes time to write the tests, but well \nfocused tests continue to pay a return on the investment by \nautomatically checking results and instilling confidence that adding new \nfeatures didn&#39;t break anything.  Without automated tests, your \ndevelopment pace suffers from the constant drag of having to manually \ninspect results with every code change.  It doesn&#39;t take long to realize \nthat the manual process doesn&#39;t scale particularly well.\n\nMike\n\n-- \nMike Clark\nClarkware Consulting, Inc.\nCustom Software Architecture, Design,\nDevelopment, and Performance Consulting\nhttp://www.clarkware.com\n\n\n",
