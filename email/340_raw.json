I know I&#39;m getting a little philosfical here :-)\n\n    How can you guard against the unexpected? I mean, how at all is that\npossible?\n\nIn my point of view, as soon as you guard against something, that something\nwould no longer be unexpected, would it?\n\nSo, if you can insert an assertSomething(someVariable) method in your code,\nthe situation that the assert checks for is no longer unexpected, is it? And\nif it&#39;s no longer unexpected, you can throw a checked exception. But what\nhappens then if something _really unexpected_ happens? Well, your program\ncrashes, and it&#39;ll be hard to say how you should recover from such a\nsituation. I&#39;d prefer logging the incident to a file, and then stop\nexecution until some human intervention can be done.\n\n... but that&#39;s just my view of things... :-)\n\nJakob Jenkov\n\n\n",
