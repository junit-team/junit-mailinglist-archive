I can see why the System.out.println() is\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; redundant here, since the assertEquals will provide the actual\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; length of the vector on failure. But generally, when and where\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; are diagnostic messages in tests appropriate? Do you have a problem\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; with System.out.println() or diagnostic messages in tests in general?\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; They&#39;re like comments. Comments are not executable and cannot fail if\n&gt;  &gt; they are wrong, so they are waste.\n&gt; \n&gt; So code should never be commented??  This makes no sense.\n\nComments that merely describe how the code does things is waste. The \ncode already says that. These are the comments that a vast majority of \nprogrammers insist on writing, largely because someone taught them to do \nso in school.\n\nComments of the type &quot;We had to do this silly thing because....&quot; \nactually communicate something.\n\n&gt;  &gt;                                    Diagnostic messages are not\n&gt;  &gt; assertions and cannot fail if they are wrong, so they are waste.\n&gt; \n&gt; It is trivially easy to put diagnostic messages inside an if -- you\n&gt; see them if something of interest occurs.\n\nWaste is waste. Large amounts of waste often build themselves up from a \nlarge number of small amounts of waste.\n\n&gt;  &gt;                                                                 Make an\n&gt;  &gt; assertion instead.\n&gt; \n&gt; Usually.  But sometimes what you want is a soft assertion -- if the\n&gt; condition doesn&#39;t hold, let me know, but keep on going.  And JUnit\n&gt; doesn&#39;t support that approach.\n\nNo surprise there: JUnit is not a logging tool.\n\nI can&#39;t think of the last time I was interested in finding an unexpected \nevent that did not cause me to want the application to stop so that I \ncould fix it. Of course, I am talking about while programming, and not \nwhile in production.\n-- \nJ. B.
