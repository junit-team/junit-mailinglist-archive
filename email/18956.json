Another example.. a while ago<br/>\n&gt; I was talking to Ivan Moore (of Jester fame) and he was saying that he<br/>\n&gt; had an idea for a tool that would go through your Java code and<br/>\n&gt; &#39;privitize&#39; it; that is, make all methods private that could be<br/>\n&gt; private.  In the spirit of the thing he was thinking of calling it<br/>\n&gt; Thatcher :-)  We were talking about it with a few other people who, like<br/>\n&gt; me, are very annoyed by the fact that private gets in the way when its<br/>\n&gt; in someone else&#39;s mangled code and you don&#39;t have the opportunity to<br/>\n&gt; peel it off, and we thought, well, wouldn&#39;t it be nice if your<br/>\n&gt; environment just told you which methods weren&#39;t used elsewhere in the<br/>\n&gt; system?  Sort of, &quot;this one could be private if you wanted it to be.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Michael,<br/>\n<br/>\nVery interesting.  Are you suggesting this tool would allow you to<br/>\nmake more things private, or allow you to leave fewer things private,<br/>\nwhile still having the documentary benefit from the IDE of an &quot;only<br/>\nused locally&quot; marker?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\n<br/>\n   David Saff</div>",
