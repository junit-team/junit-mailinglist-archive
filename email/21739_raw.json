I am using JUnit 4 with the @=\r\nAfter annotation.  I can&#39;t quite tell what the issue is, but it seems that =\r\nmaybe IDEA and/or TeamCity is not always reporting all of the errors when t=\r\nhere is a multiple exception scenario.  I was doing some testing after my o=\r\nriginal post, and the behavior was inconsistent.\n\n  Regardless, am I missin=\r\ng anything here with respect to a way to assert state after any test in a c=\r\nlass is run?  I&#39;ve seen many posts where people preach about not asserting =\r\nin tearDown/@After, but no one seems to offer any alternatives.  Is this si=\r\nmply something not currently available in JUnit?  If not, I wonder if this =\r\nis something the current maintainers would consider useful.  Maybe an @Afte=\r\nrAssert or something that notes a method that should be run after the test =\r\nonly if the test did not have any assertion failures itself.\n\nRegards,\nPaul=\r\n\n\n--- In junit@yahoogroups.com, David Saff &lt;david@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Can you u=\r\nse JUnit 4?  Asserts in @After methods are handled more\n&gt; cleanly than in J=\r\nUnit 3.
