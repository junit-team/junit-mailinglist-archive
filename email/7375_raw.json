Not sure how you could close the connection at\n&gt;&gt;&gt;the end of the last test method executed, though. Has anyone used\n&gt;&gt;&gt;static variables to share fixture objects among multiple test methods?\n&gt;&gt;&gt;      \n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;I did this very thing by accident - as I&#39;m new to JUnit testing.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;I have legacy DB code I have to test and the original author used a  \n&gt;&gt;static anonymous class to\n&gt;&gt;create the connection cache.  I use setup() to instantiate the  \n&gt;&gt;underlying class and get/close my\n&gt;&gt;DB connections in each test.  I pay the penalty for the connection  \n&gt;&gt;creation in the first test, but\n&gt;&gt;every other test is fairly fast.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;So far, I&#39;ve found JUnits testing of each test method to be low level  \n&gt;&gt;in design and nature...  I\n&gt;&gt;create a method in an object and my test methods exercise my method -  \n&gt;&gt;checking for validity of\n&gt;&gt;execution.  I&#39;ve found JUnit assumes I&#39;m interested in assuring the  \n&gt;&gt;tested method executes and\n&gt;&gt;provides some specific result.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;Maybe I&#39;m still too new to JUnit to know what I&#39;m missing with  \n&gt;&gt;SuiteRunner - but I&#39;ve always\n&gt;&gt;thought the first test I must *always* perform is the validation of my  \n&gt;&gt;code against the\n&gt;&gt;specifications - that what I&#39;m writing is performing to expectations.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;Your right, if I write code that modifies a part of my object in some  \n&gt;&gt;way, I need to insure that I\n&gt;&gt;haven&#39;t created an artifact that can damage some other part of the  \n&gt;&gt;code.  Isn&#39;t that the basis of\n&gt;&gt;performing lots of different asserts in each of your tests?  If I can  \n&gt;&gt;alter some part of my object\n&gt;&gt;thru my code, then after my code runs, don&#39;t I want to verify the  \n&gt;&gt;contents of the underlying\n&gt;&gt;object?  All within one test? (Not Suite of tests - but an individual  \n&gt;&gt;test...)\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;If I&#39;m too far off topic, please forgive me.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;Not off topic at all. I was asking if anyone had used static members to  \n&gt;share fixture among multiple test methods in a single TestCase, and you  \n&gt;did. You even did it for a database connection, which was the example I  \n&gt;mentioned. The one question I still have about your test code is, did  \n&gt;you find a way to explicitly close the connection after the last test  \n&gt;method finished? Or was it just left open under the assumption your app  \n&gt;would go away soon enough.\n&gt;\n&gt;One significant difference between the static member approach to  \n&gt;fixture sharing in JUnit and SuiteRunner is that I know how to close  \n&gt;the connection when I&#39;m done in SuiteRunner, but not in JUnit. If  \n&gt;anyone has a way to do that, please reply.\n&gt;\n&gt;Another difference is really one of design taste I suspect. I just  \n&gt;found it non-intuitive that JUnit gave each test method invocation its  \n&gt;own instance, especially when they also provided the setUp() method. I  \n&gt;used JUnit a long time before I realized this object wrapping was going  \n&gt;on. In a previous post to this list, I asked if anyone could help me  \n&gt;understand what benefit I get for that wrapping. I mentioned that the  \n&gt;only benefit I could see was that if I screw up my  setUp() and  \n&gt;tearDown() methods and don&#39;t actually initialize and clean up the  \n&gt;fixture correctly, the wrapping of method invocations may let me get  \n&gt;away with it. Vladimir Bossicard agreed that that was a benefit, and no  \n&gt;one else offered any others.\n&gt;\n&gt;My design sense when I was doing that part of SuiteRunner was to not  \n&gt;provide the extra shield. I figured it would be relatively rare that a  \n&gt;user would screw up their setUpFixture() and tearDownFixture() methods.  \n&gt;When they do, they get a red bar and can fix the bug like any other  \n&gt;bug. Then they get a green bar. And all the while the hierarchy of  \n&gt;objects that make up their test is the intuitive simple tree of objects  \n&gt;that for a long time (until I realized that the object wrapping was  \n&gt;going on) I imagined JUnit was building.\n&gt;\n&gt;Bill\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;Bob\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;__________________________________________________\n&gt;&gt;Do you Yahoo!?\n&gt;&gt;Yahoo!
