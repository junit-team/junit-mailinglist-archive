So from <br/>\ntime to time, in this area something may go wrong. Therefore I&#39;m <br/>\nlooking for a tool, that generates a report showing only the <br/>\ndifferences between current and last JUnit report - which failing <br/>\ntests were fixed, which tests stopped to pass, which tests were added <br/>\nand which removed. Additionaly a test trend analysis should be <br/>\npossible.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know, parsing the XML junitreport output and generating the info, <br/>\ne.g., with the help of a database, would be possible. But is anyone <br/>\naware of an existing tool or open source project that can help in this <br/>\ndirection?<br/>\n<br/>\n--Klaus</div>",
