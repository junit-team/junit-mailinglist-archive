    "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-868708031\"><blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">&gt; I don&#39;t like that mix too, but what I can&#39;t see is how I can <br/>\n&gt; bound an instance of MyClass (which already exists when the <br/>\n&gt; test runs) to a instance of TestMyClass which are launched by <br/>\n&gt; the TestRunner. <br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; My problem is that I can&#39;t use the &#39;new&#39; <br/>\n&gt; operator to create instances of MyClass inside TestMyClass <br/>\n&gt; because I&#39;m tied to the framework factory method. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>are these factory methods static or not ?<br/>\n<br/>\nIf instance methods: You would have some class of the framework you can<br/>\ninstantiate in your setUp() and then call the factory method.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf static: &quot;big problem&quot; (design wise, I find), but seriously, in your setUp<br/>\nyou just copy anything you have to do to create MyClass in other<br/>\ncircumstances. In your production code you have to create an instance to,<br/>\none way or the other.<br/>\n<br/>\nMight be something like this:<br/>\n<br/>\npublic void setUp(){<br/>\n\tframework = MotherOfAllFrameworks.getInstance();<br/>\n\t// or = new MotherOfAllFrameworks(...);<br/>\n\tmyInstance = framework.create(...);<br/>\n} <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Makes this any sense? Perhaps I should practice a bit more <br/>\n&gt; with the JUnit framewok to get a better understand about how <br/>\n&gt; it could fit. Even more, I should practice more with complex <br/>\n&gt; structures in Java to get fluency in my designs - the <br/>\n&gt; beginnings are always hard :-).<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Well, thats a neverending story for all of us ;-)</div>",
