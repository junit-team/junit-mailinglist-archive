    "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2011297039\">Ok, I&#39;m a little confused.<br/>\nI&#39;ve been using JUnit for a while and using single decorators to <br/>\ncreate the environment for all the tests to run it.<br/>\nI have now started writing some new tests where I want to run the <br/>\nsame tests in a variety of different environments.  I thought I could <br/>\njust have a number of Decorators and add them to the suite so that in <br/>\nturn the tests are run instead each decorator.  Example of suite.<br/>\n<br/>\n    public static Test suite()<br/>\n    {<br/>\n        TestSuite suite = new TestSuite(&quot;Some Tests&quot;);<br/>\n<br/>\n        suite.addTest(new TestSetupA(new TestSuite(MyTests.class)));<br/>\n        suite.addTest(new TestSetupB(new TestSuite(MyTests.class)));<br/>\n        <br/>\n        .<br/>\n        .<br/>\n        .<br/>\n<br/>\n        suite.addTest(new TestSetupX(new TestSuite(MyTests.class)));<br/>\n<br/>\n        return suite;<br/>\n    }<br/>\n<br/>\nSo in this case I use TestSetupA to create an environment that all <br/>\nthe test cases in MyTests are run inside.  I then create a new <br/>\nenvironment using TestSetupB for the same test cases etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe problem I am having is that for every TestSetup decorator I add <br/>\nit makes the tests run that many times.  If I have 3 decorators then <br/>\nTestSetupA.setUp() is run 3 times. Then all the test cases are run 3 <br/>\ntimes, then TestSetupA.tearDown() 3 times.  After that <br/>\nTestSetupB.setUp() is called 3 times, then all tests are run 3 times <br/>\nand TestSetupB.tearDown() 3 times, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy is this happening, is it a bug or is there another was I should <br/>\nsolve this solution of running the test cases in different <br/>\nenvironments?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for any information (esp. if you understand me :)<br/>\n<br/>\n Tony</div>",
