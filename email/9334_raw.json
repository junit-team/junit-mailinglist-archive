I went through\n&gt; some of the basic papers as JUnit Test Infected, junit cook book etc.\n&gt; but am not understanding the correct use of that. \n&gt;  \n&gt; Like if I create a simple program like addition of two integers and want\n&gt; to pass the values of a and b to be some (i.e., generating the test\n&gt; cases), how can I do using the JUnit.  I created a JUnit program\n&gt; &quot;TestAddInt.java &quot;with a testAdd() method in that compared the resultant\n&gt; value of a and b with the expected value but its something like I took\n&gt; the values a and b as ints..TestAddInt.java but am not understanding how\n&gt; to bring the values of the original java program &quot;AddInt.java&quot;??\n&gt;  \n&gt; I am pretty sure that if someone give a simple example, I will learn the\n&gt; rest. So I would be thankful if someone helps me out.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Regards,\n&gt; Pallavi\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ---------------------------------\n&gt; Do you Yahoo!?\n&gt; Yahoo!
