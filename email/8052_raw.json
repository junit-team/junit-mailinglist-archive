With this class, that behavior is that anything\nsaved with saveLicense() can be loaded with loadLicense(...).  So that\nmakes good sense (to me) as a single test.\n\nIf you had some kind of requirement that things written with\nsaveLicense have a particular format, or that loadLicense expects a\nparticular format (for 3rd party integration or something), then you&#39;d\nhave more behaviors and probably want to make separate tests.  Even in\nthat case, though, testing that stuff saved with saveLicense can be\nloaded with loadLicense isn&#39;t a bad thing to do.\n\n$.02\n\nKevin\n\n&gt; Given that I have two methods of my class I need to test, SaveLicense\n&gt; and LoadLicense, should I write this as two separate tests or as a \n&gt; single test that incorporates both? To clarify, to load a license, I \n&gt; would need to have a saved license. The load license would then\nverify \n&gt; that the information that was saved was loaded correctly.\n\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nThe New Yahoo! Search - Faster. Easier.
