I guess I had better \nstart with the story behind it.  My AP Computer Science teacher uses \nJUnit along with BlueJ to help him grade our labs.  It makes it easy \nfor him to test all of the methods that each student has written for \nthe assignment.  The problem, however, is that this was very time \nconsuming, as he has many students, and he had to compile and run \nthe tests on each student&#39;s code.  Thus, he asked me to help him by \nwriting a program that would do it for him.  Which is how JAM*Tester \ncame about.  I&#39;m still working on it, but it would be nice if a \ncouple of people could try it and let me know if it works.\n\nThe website is http://www.depoll.com.  Right now it only works on \nWindows machines, but I&#39;m working on it!  Thanks for the interest!  \nPlease e-mail me any suggestions you may have (check the contact \npage on the website).\n\nP.S.  I guess I should say a little about myself.  I&#39;m a 16 year old \nJunior at Troy High School (Class of &#39;05).  I love programming.  \nIt&#39;s a lot of fun.  This project gave me an opportunity to \nexperiment with some unfamiliar concepts.  I hope you like it.\n\n\n\n",
