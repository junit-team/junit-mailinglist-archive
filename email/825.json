Goodness knows the loader could use a bunch more tests.<br/>\n<br/>\nPart of the political statement of JUnit is that as the reporter of <br/>\nbugs you have the additional responsibility to track down the bugs <br/>\nfar enough that the provider has an objective measure of whether they <br/>\nwill have satisfied you. We could debate whether this is a better, or <br/>\neven reasonable, social contract, but it&#39;s how Erich and I work.<br/>\n<br/>\nKent</div>",
