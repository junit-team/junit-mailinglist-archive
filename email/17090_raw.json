This mea=\r\nns that \n* the contructors of all tests are called before any tests are run=\r\n, leading to some \ninteresting issues if any initialization is done there i=\r\nnstead of in setUp, \n* resources created in setUp and assigned to test clas=\r\ns fields hang around until the end of \nthe test run, kept alive by the suit=\r\ne\n* we get some very different behaviour running all tests in ant using for=\r\nk=3Dtrue, compared \nto running all tests in the same VM\n\nNow in junit 4 it =\r\nlooks like the instances of test classes are constructed on the fly. The \nc=\r\nonstructor of each test instance is called just before @Before.\n\nSo my ques=\r\ntion - is this a designed behaviour? Can I assume that junit 4 runners will=\r\n have \nthis behaviour, allowing me to use the constructor instead of @Befor=\r\ne, allowing fields to \nbe final, etc? \n\nDoes anyone have experience of cons=\r\ntructors v @Before in junit 4?\n\nFinally, is there scope for releasing the t=\r\nest class instances after each test has run? This \nwould give us a much sma=\r\nller footprint for large test suites, without having to assign \nfields to n=\r\null in @After.\n\nThanks in anticipation\n\nDuncan Mc^Gregor\n&quot;The name rings a =\r\nbell&quot;\n\n\n\n\n",
