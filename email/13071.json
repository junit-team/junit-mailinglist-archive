Not sure why.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It could be that when you&#39;re running ant from within Eclipse, you&#39;re not<br/>\nusing the ant you think you&#39;re using.  That&#39;s happened to me before.  By<br/>\ndefault, Eclipse uses its own ant, which has its own ant/lib, which<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t come with the JUnit jars in it.  My solution was to configure<br/>\nEclipse to use the same ant I used from outside Eclipse.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nTodd.</div>",
