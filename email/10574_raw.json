Question: why test protected methods? Further \nquestion: \n&gt; why make the method protected in the first place?\n&gt; \n&gt; Testing non-public parts of an interface creates unnecessary \ncoupling \n&gt; between tests and production code, hindering refactoring. If you \ncare \n&gt; about having the freedom to refactor, then don&#39;t test non-public \n&gt; methods. If you want to test a non-public method, then maybe it \n&gt; shouldn&#39;t be public.\n&gt; \n&gt; Search the archives of this group for more detailed arguments.\n&gt; \n&gt; Take care.\n&gt; -- \n&gt; J.
