In my \n    &gt; opinion, this has a bad\n    &gt; smell, but ... well, I am interested of your opinion as I \n    &gt; am not to sure if\n    &gt; I am right.\n\nActually, I thought it was a *neat* idea, if needed.  He points out to\nplaces where the need for this might be apparent, you decide on the need.\nRecorder is just a special case of a listener.  You don&#39;t have to implement\nit the way Eric did, I think his implementation is a case of DTSTTCPW for\nhis article.  More than likely, if you wanted some kind of Recorder like\nthis you would have an update method on the observed classes that would\ncause the observer(s) to update itself.  If you wanted to get specific\ninformation about the class that is updating (like the method name), you\ncould use the second parameter of the update method from the Observer\ninterface.  Or if you have need of that param for something else, use double\ndispatching to call back on the observable.\n\nIn short, it&#39;s a bad smell if you don&#39;t need it (either through his\nimplementation or through your own).  \n\n-Jason\n\n\n",
