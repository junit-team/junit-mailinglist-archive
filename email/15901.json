The logic could be<br/>\n&gt; something like:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; if (I am asked to run a junit3 test on something) {<br/>\n&gt;    if (any methods have the @Test annotation) {<br/>\n&gt;       use junit4 behavior<br/>\n&gt;    }<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;    fallback<br/>\n&gt; }<br/>\n </span></blockquote>We could look at it.  However, the logic would be more likely that it <br/>\nwould try every possible way to run the class as a JUnit 3 test, and <br/>\nthen try JUnit 4 as a fallback (since not all JUnit 4 test classes have <br/>\n@Test).<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; &gt; When you have an expected exception, and another one gets thrown, the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; error trace doesn&#39;t contain the bad exception. You only get:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; java.lang.AssertionError: Unexpected exception,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; expected&lt;java.util.NoSuchElementException&gt; but<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; was&lt;java.lang.NullPointerException&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Having the trace of the bad exception would help TAs debug student<br/>\n&gt; code.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; That&#39;s a good idea.  We&#39;ll try to have that in the next release.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thanks. This also comes up with timeouts. It&#39;d be really cool to have<br/>\n&gt; a stacktrace from where the thread was hung.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Agreed.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Oh, and since I&#39;m talking to another person from a school with a great<br/>\n&gt; CS dept ;-), I&#39;m really interested in writing good docs for students<br/>\n&gt; on how to write test suites, especially for data structures (the focus<br/>\n&gt; of the 15-211 course). I have something that I hacked up for our first<br/>\n&gt; homework, however, this kind of thing would be great to make into a<br/>\n&gt; tutorial that could be used by other classes.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Lecture 11 from MIT 6.170 is the best pre-prepared doc I know of around <br/>\nhere:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://ocw.mit.edu/OcwWeb/Electrical-Engineering-and-Computer-Science/6-170Laboratory-in-Software-EngineeringFall2001/LectureNotes/index.htm\">http://ocw.mit.edu/OcwWeb/Electrical-Engineering-and-Computer-Science/6-170Laboratory-in-Software-EngineeringFall2001/LectureNotes/index.htm</a><br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d be very interested in your materials, as well, if they&#39;re publicly <br/>\navailable.
