So IMHO,\ntestNeedImplement() seems to fit better.\n\nSecond, a REAL post-it or a note at the back of your task card seem to work a\nlot more effectively.\n\nActually, I applaud for the other post about the Calendar assertion.  That seems\nto be something novel.  :)\n\nRobert Watkins wrote:\n\n&gt; Shane Duan wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Plus, I am sure that all the XP developers would strongly\n&gt; &gt; disagree with the comment here.  The closest way I can think\n&gt; &gt; of is to name the method as test_NeedImplement() but it sure\n&gt; &gt; looks weird.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Mind if I ask why exactly do you want a empty test method\n&gt; &gt; there?  What is the difference if you just add the method later?\n&gt;\n&gt; XP developers will say nothing of the sort. If the comment is the simplest\n&gt; thing that works, go for it. FWIW, I would use the method name to tell me\n&gt; what I&#39;m meant to be testing.\n&gt;\n&gt; As to why: it&#39;s a placeholder so you don&#39;t forget it.
