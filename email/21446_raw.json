Later\nI&#39;ll try and answer each question directly.\n\n \n\nPersonally, I like to write a test for each aspect of the thing I&#39;m\ntesting.  I really don&#39;t like copy and pasting tests with different test\ndata.  \n\n \n\nLet us say, for a given method there are 10 sets of parameters, or\ncorner cases, that completely cover that method.\n\n \n\nIf I were to follow the one test per set of parameters methodology, I\nwould need 10 tests to cover the method under test in question.\n\n \n\nNow, I hate to say it, but for the sake of argument, the method under\ntest changes.  (This happens to me a lot.  I know a sign of lack of\nthink-first-driven development.)  The result of the 10 tests each\ndifferent parameters is 10 test method changes for one method under test\nchange.  To me that would lead to not wanting to write tests first.\n\n \n\nOn the other hand, supposed I supplied these 10 sets of parameters,\nalong with their expected output, to a parameterized Runner of the test\nclass.  There would be only one test method for all of the sets of\nparameters.  Thus when the method under test changes, I need only to\nchange a single test method.\n\n \n\nTo address the running one set of data at a time.  There is nothing\nprohibiting someone from commenting out all of the other parameter sets\nwhen you run the test class.  Thus you allowed only the parameters you\nwanted to run, to run.  Basically performing the same task as running\none test method at a time.\n\n \n\nNow for your direct questions...\n\n[Pigneri, Rocco] but how is a parameterized test different from running\nthe same function over and over on different test data that is defined\nin each test?\n\nI think I discussed this above...\n\n \n\n[Pigneri, Rocco] Does it run all the test functions on this single\nparameterized instance and report on them as a group?\n\nPlease see lines 118-204 of the following link\nhttp://github.com/bigmikef/junit/blob/f45b41bfc7699fb2cc031025e0eca71737\nd9c88c/src/test/java/org/junit/tests/running/classes/ParameterizedTestTe\nst.java\n\n \n\nIf you don&#39;t want to go there, I&#39;ll explain... (I think the two tests\nreally illustrate the point of a parameterized class.)\n\n \n\nFor each inner Object[] returned by the method annotated with\n@Parameters, the entire test class is &quot;tested&quot;.  Each Object[] is passed\nto the constructor of the test class.  (These parameters might be\naccessible other ways, but I haven&#39;t learned that yet.)  Once your\nconstructor gets the parameters they can be used and referenced via\nvariables in the test methods.  For that Object[] all the methods\nannotated with @Test are executed.\n\n \n\nMy ide, eclipse, reports the results of each test as it happens just\nlike a standard test class.  They are even grouped by index number of\nthe Object[] they used.  Not really sure who is responsible for this\naspect.\n\n \n\n[Pigneri, Rocco] Is parameterization simply a method of compacting code\nand reporting by treating tests as parameterized groups rather than\nindependent functions exploded out to cover each parameterized case?\n\nI think the answer is yes.  But I might not understand the question.\n\n \n\nHope I helped,\n\n \n\nBig Mike\n\n \n\nP.S. Please annotate the original quote copied with something.  It&#39;s\nhard for me to realize that you are commenting on a previous statement.\n\n \n\n \n \n\nFrom: junit@yahoogroups.com [mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com] On Behalf Of\nPigneri, Rocco\nSent: Wednesday, March 25, 2009 12:45 PM\nTo: junit@yahoogroups.com\nSubject: RE: [junit] Listening for after a parameterized instance run...\n\n \n\nA parameterized test performs like building a suite of multiple\ninstances of your test class, each with different parameters. (That you\nsupply.) What I want is to run a specific method after each run of a\nparameterized instance of the &quot;suite&quot;.\n\nInteresting. I can take this conversation off-line if there is a\ndocument somewhere that better explains this, but how is a parameterized\ntest different from running the same function over and over on different\ntest data that is defined in each test? Does it run all the test\nfunctions on this single parameterized instance and report on them as a\ngroup? Is parameterization simply a method of compacting code and\nreporting by treating tests as parameterized groups rather than\nindependent functions exploded out to cover each parameterized case?\n\nThank you,\n\nRocco\n\nFrom: junit@yahoogroups.com &lt;mailto:junit%40yahoogroups.com&gt;\n[mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com &lt;mailto:junit%40yahoogroups.com&gt; ] On\nBehalf Of\nForsberg, Mike\nSent: Tuesday, March 24, 2009 4:22 PM\nTo: junit@yahoogroups.com &lt;mailto:junit%40yahoogroups.com&gt; \nSubject: RE: [junit] Listening for after a parameterized instance run...\n\nWell the problem is that @AfterClass runs after the entire class runs.\nNot after each parameterized test.\n\nA parameterized test performs like building a suite of multiple\ninstances of your test class, each with different parameters. (That you\nsupply.) What I want is to run a specific method after each run of a\nparameterized instance of the &quot;suite&quot;.\n\nI&#39;ve implemented a solution, and it is at\nhttp://github.com/bigmikef/junit. It adds @BeforeParameterize and\n@AfterParameterize to the Parameterized class. These methods are called\nas expected during a Parameterized run.\n\nIt would be awesome if the owners included it in JUnit.
