I&#39;m i=\r\nmagining an ant target that would automatically build a\nbar chart that show=\r\ns the progress of test results over the course of a\nproject.  The X axis wo=\r\nuld be time, maybe in 1 week increments.  The Y\naxis would be number of tes=\r\nts.  And I&#39;d have a stacked bar for each week\nto show the total tests execu=\r\nted, broken down into pass/fail/error.\nThat way, management could look at t=\r\nhe chart and see our progress on the\nproject from the perspective of tests =\r\n(whether it&#39;s unit tests or system\ntests that use JUnit) and feel happy.  L=\r\nater I might even add in code\ncoverage percentages for even more juicy good=\r\nness.\n\nHas anyone else put something like this together?  Mike mentioned he=\r\n&#39;s\nheard of others who want to build such a results graphing tool, but\ndidn=\r\n&#39;t know if anyone&#39;s got one they&#39;re sharing.  So I&#39;m posting here,\nlooking =\r\nfor pointers.\n\n\nThanks in advance,\nTodd.\n----\nTodd Bradley - Polycom - QA L=\r\nead, Super Secret Project\n\nVisit me at my WebOffice for IM and app sharing:=\r\n\nhttp://www.polycomweboffice.com/todd.bradley@... \n\n\n\n",
