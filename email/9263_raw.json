Sorry I didn&#39;t get to it earlier but my\nEmail=\r\n reader decided to file this separately and I&#39;ve missed it until\nnow.\n\nIn a=\r\n nutshell, my tests are functional in nature and not UnitTests.\nThey are cl=\r\noser to CustomerTests as well given that I want to simulate\nuser interactio=\r\nn with the applications (which are accessible via the web\nserver).  The nat=\r\nure of our product means that I don&#39;t think I need the\noverhead of using Ca=\r\nctus.  Our product can currently run on its own on a\nset-top box or within =\r\nits own container on a server.  As such, our\nfunctional tests are effective=\r\nly the same and we&#39;d like to reuse these\naccordingly, and build upon them f=\r\nor future customer scenarios.\n\nDid you get a chance to see my follow-up Ema=\r\nil to my original post?  I\nthink I have an idea for how to solve this, but =\r\nI wanted some validation\non it.  Hopefully I&#39;ll get to go ahead and JustTry=\r\nIt, but I&#39;m currently\ntasked with another project and won&#39;t be able to get =\r\nto it as\nimmediately as I would like.\n\nThanks again for the reply, and sorr=\r\ny if this is too far OT for this\ngroup.\n\nCheers,\n\nTom\n\n-----Original Messag=\r\ne-----\nFrom: Paul Christmann [mailto:java-junit@...] \nSent: August =\r\n27, 2003 11:03 AM\n\nI&#39;ve also wanted similar functionality as you describe, =\r\nand have done it\nusing ant, junit, tomcat and cactus.  (And my own WebServe=\r\nr java code.\nYikes.....).  (I don&#39;t consider this &quot;unit&quot; testing, per se.  =\r\nBut I do\nconsider it a reasonable problem, and one that I solved with &quot;unit=\r\n&quot;\ntesting tools.)\n\nSo here&#39;s a bunch of thoughts which I hope provide some =\r\ninsights into\nwhat I did to solve a similar problem:\n\nI wanted to test HTTP=\r\n communication with a server, and test excercising\nremote functionality.  A=\r\nt first, I thought they were the same tests, and\nI only tried to excercise =\r\nthe remote functionality.  I quickly learned\nthat this was too hard - becau=\r\nse a problem with a malformed HTTP message\nwas very hard to diagnose.  So, =\r\nI split the problem into two:\n\n1) Test HTTP Communication with a server.  I=\r\n now define this as meaning:\ncan my client generate an appropriate http mes=\r\nsage, with the correct\nheaders and body?  Can the server interpret an http =\r\nmessage, reading\nhttp headers correctly?\n\nThis is something I consider &quot;uni=\r\nt&quot; tests.\n\n1a) Testing the server side is pretty easy using cactus.  I use =\r\nthe\nFilterTestCase, as all of our Http &quot;interpretation&quot; on the server is\nha=\r\nndled in a single Filter.  So all I have to do is test that single\nfilter t=\r\no make sure Http headers are interpreted appropriately.\n\n1b) Testing the cl=\r\nient side is a little harder, and required me to\neventually mock a web serv=\r\ner for the client to use just to trap http\nheaders.  I&#39;m not particularly f=\r\nond of this solution.\nEssentially, the build launches its own web server, t=\r\nhe client code\ntalks to it, and then the test code verifies that the web se=\r\nrver\nreceived expected data.\n\n2) Test remote method invocations: If I ask t=\r\nhe server to do something,\ndoes it do the right thing?\n\nThis is something I=\r\n consider &quot;functional&quot; testing.\n\n(In our case, all request/responses are wr=\r\napped as Java objects.  So\ntest code deals only with Java objects, without =\r\nany knowledge of the\nfact that perhaps a remote server was called to handle=\r\n the request.  The\ntest code just creates and verifies java objects)\n\n2a) I=\r\n have ant build file that will run a bunch of JUnit tests with a\nURL provid=\r\ned as input.  The test java code opens a connection to the\nprovided URL and=\r\n requests something (the actual opening of the\nURLConnedtion is hidden from=\r\n the test code).  The test java code then\nverifies the response.\n\n2b) The a=\r\nnt build file will (by default) launch its own version of\nTomcat first.  Th=\r\ne test will run entirely on a single machine;\nlaunch Tomcat with an appropr=\r\niate web application and the JUnit tests\ntalk to it.  This (getting tomcat =\r\nstarted up) proved to be a little\ntricky, but quite doable.\n\n2c) Alternativ=\r\nely, by changing the build properties, the same JUnit test\nwill run against=\r\n an already running server (locally or remotely, doesn&#39;t\nmatter).  In our c=\r\nase, we use that to verify a deployed/staging\nenvironment.\n\nI&#39;m going to sk=\r\nip posting details of code and build files unless\nanyone actually thinks it=\r\n would be useful.\n\nThomas Robbs wrote:\n&gt; Greetings...\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m finding myse=\r\nlf in a situation where I would like to create the \n&gt; following type of tes=\r\nt case:\n&gt; \n&gt; - testing a web service via HTTP - default testing of the serv=\r\nice \n&gt; would require that the HTTP server is started up on the local machin=\r\ne\n&gt;  - an additional way of executing the test would be to have the same\n&gt; =\r\n HTTP based tests execute against an assumed host/port that is\n&gt; already ru=\r\nnning the HTTP server w/ the service.\n-- \nPC\n\nPaul Christmann\nPrior Artisan=\r\ns, LLC\nmailto:paul@...\n504-587-9072\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYahoo!
