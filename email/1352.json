E returns to C, C <br/>\nreturns to B, B returns to A.<br/>\n<br/>\nif you want to just test A, then create a Mock of B.  The Mock of B <br/>\nwill just validate it was called, and return.  In the test, replace B <br/>\nwith Mock B.  So the test looks like...<br/>\n<br/>\nA calls Mock B, Mock B returns to A<br/>\n<br/>\nThis way you are only testing A and it&#39;s interaction with B.  It also <br/>\nhelps with maintiance of your unit tests.  Without the Mock B, <br/>\nanytime C or E changes, you are likely to need to change your test.  <br/>\nWith the mock object, the test is no longer dependent of C and E.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Greg<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In junit@y..., darren.hobbs@y... wrote:<br/>\n&gt; cc:<br/>\n&gt; bcc:<br/>\n&gt; Contact:   Tel: 2761  -  None Available, 1st Floor South, Queens <br/>\nWalk<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Testing private methods<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; If your method chains are so large its hard to pinpoint the problem <br/>\nwhen a unit<br/>\n&gt; test fails, then perhaps some refactoring is in order to break up <br/>\nthe chain.
