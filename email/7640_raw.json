I want to start writing unit tests for my\n&gt; code and in general improve my development practices.   So I \ndownloaded\n&gt; JUnit, and read through some articles and examples.\n&gt; They are all too trivial.\n\nFor last 2 years of using JUnit for several big project I have not \nfound &quot;real code&quot;, that is not possible to unit test, except bad \ndesign.\nI am saying there is very little to none of the code that is \nconsidered a well designed and hard to test with JUnit.\nAll my tests look very trivial too, but they together are the net \nthat catches 99% of the bugs. Time spent for building it worth every \nsecond!\n\n&gt; course not always.   How do you unit test such beasts?\n\n&gt; \n&gt; So far in all my attempts to get started at this I find that the \ntest\n&gt; code itself becomes very complex - not as complex as my application,\n&gt; but enough that the time I would end up writing and debugging the\n&gt; test seems completely unreasonable.   I would love to have the\n&gt; finished tests, but I simply can&#39;t see how I could justify writing\n&gt; them, as it would more than double my design and coding development\n&gt; time.\n\nI would be glad to have a look on your complex code. Learning unit \ntest writing is definetly better for new code in small projects, but \nonce mastered those skills can easily be appied to &quot;complex&quot; code. \nCan you challenge me with an example of buildable code, that is so \nhard to test?\n\n\n&gt; In the end I would almost end up with an &quot;automated user&quot;, and of\n&gt; course that is a tad extreme and prone to it&#39;s own sorts of errors\n&gt; and assumptions.\nSounds like functional test.\n\n&gt; I&#39;ve told co-workers about what I have read about unit testing,\n&gt; testing frameworks etc.  None of my co-workers do unit tests, and ll\n&gt; of them have the same attitude.  Unit testing is too\n&gt; complex/difficult to use when making real complete programs.\n&gt; \n&gt; So I&#39;m asking... Who else has been down this path?  How do I get \npast this point?   Am I making sense or have I just gotten something\n&gt; completely wrong? Or is this unit testing just a passing fad that is\n&gt; really nothing more than a bunch of hype?\n\nI&#39;ve been there, down this path! And now I am unit test advocate in \nmy team. It is one of the easiest XP policy to explain to managers. \nMore IT managers convinced that unit tests can significanly improve \nquality of software. JUnit is very lightweight framework for unit \ntests.\n\n\n",
