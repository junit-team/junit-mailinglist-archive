For example, I\n&gt; &gt; want to run=\r\n JBoss microcontainer in doYourOneTimeSetup(), so I want to\n&gt; &gt; do it for A=\r\nNY suite that I will run and they very. I want to test some\n&gt; &gt; aspect of t=\r\nhe system, and afterwards, another aspect and so on. This\n&gt; &gt; will force me=\r\n to change this class every time. See also next point.\n&gt; \n&gt; I actually don&#39;=\r\nt quite understand this.  Are you saying that you&#39;re\n&gt; changing the startup=\r\n parameters to your microcontainer by hand between\n&gt; each run of your test =\r\nsuite?\n\nNo, I am not. I just want that doYourOneTimeSetup() would be run on=\r\nce\nfor ANY suite that run. doYourOneTimeSetup() will startup\nmicrocontainer=\r\n. Parameters to it doesn&#39;t changdes.\n \n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Morevoer, suppose, you want t=\r\no run only some specific methods from\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; those classes, not all the met=\r\nhods, how can you do it\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; In JUnit 3.8.x\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; there was a way to do =\r\nit.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; What was your favorite?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; public static Test suite() {\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; TestSuite suite=3D new TestSuite();\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; suite.addTest(MoneyTest=\r\n.class, &quot;fooName&quot;);\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; return suite;\n&gt; &gt; }\n&gt; \n&gt; True, this is not as e=\r\nasy in 4.4.  Choosing individual methods to run\n&gt; from the command line or =\r\nEclipse is fairly simple, but mixing and\n&gt; matching methods from multiple c=\r\nlasses takes a fair amount of magic.\n&gt; Do you find yourself wanting to do t=\r\nhis often?  (I usually am either\n&gt; running a whole suite, one class in the =\r\nsuite, or one method).\nWhen I write some code or fix the bug I usually want=\r\n to run some\nsubgroup of the test suite. I should split up my suite to the =\r\nsmaller\none, I know, but I couldn&#39;t to do it easily and, in fact, architect=\r\nure\ndon&#39;t want to do it.\n\n\n\n",
