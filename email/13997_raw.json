I want\n&gt; the developer of the test to state this. Maybe they could use a\n&gt; particular formatted comment, which I could parse and use to augment\n&gt; the results?\n&gt; \n&gt; The method I come up with I may have to impose on other groups within\n&gt; this project, so I don&#39;t want it to be heavy handed, if possible.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks for any suggestions,\n\nI use custom Javadoc taglets \n(http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/tooldocs/javadoc/taglet/overview.html) \nto relate classes to external documentation. For example, each of my \nclasses under test has a @... tag in the class comment that will \ngenerate a link to the TestCase&#39;s Javadoc page. You can also write a \ncustom Javadoc Doclet that will gather all of these links into a page of \nyour own design.\n\nI&#39;ve never done any post-processing work to integrate these into \nCruiseControl, but it shouldn&#39;t be too hard:\n\n1) Write a custom taglet to relate TestCases to requirements\n2) Write a custom doclet that will generate a report\n3) Post-process the results.xml file to use the report to map results to \nrequirements\n\nI can post some sample Taglet code, if anyone wants it.\n\n",
