Thanks for the suggestion.\n\n-Brian\n\n--- In junit@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Jason Rogers&quot; &lt;jacaetevha@f...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; These are exceptional cases, right?  So, throw specific exceptions\nthat\n&gt; you can then catch in your test.\n&gt; \n&gt; For instance, some of our tables prevent duplicate records.  We\ncatch\n&gt; that particular case and report it as an exceptional case.  If that\n&gt; happened to go wrong in the transaction when all else is fine we\nknow it\n&gt; in the test (and we explicitly test for that).  On the same\ntransaction\n&gt; there could be an attempt to enter a string for a number field, we\nwould\n&gt; catch that as a separate exception and report it -- and of course we\n&gt; would explicitly test for that case.\n&gt; \n&gt; =jason\n&gt; [:question | ^One] \n&gt; \n&gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; From: Brian &lt;br524@y...&gt; [mailto:br524@y...] \n&gt; Sent: Friday, January 03, 2003 1:04 PM\n&gt; To: junit@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Subject: [junit] Re: Conditional tearDown()\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; No, you have a good point.\n&gt; \n&gt; The problem is that my test writes to the database, then I call the\n&gt; method that I&#39;m unit testing which performs several database\nfunctions\n&gt; within a transaction, then I read from the database again to test\nthe\n&gt; values.  The test could fail at any one of these three points.\n&gt; \n&gt; Your suggestion of cleaning up code though made me look at the\n&gt; transactional method I was testing though...it turns out I was\nmissing\n&gt; a rollback() call, so thanks!  But that still doesn&#39;t solve the\n&gt; problem I have with three points of failure within my test.

I realize that there may\nbe\n&gt; &gt; times when you absolutely need the visual inspection (though I\ncan&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; think of one off the bat), nevertheless, this seems like a subtle\n&gt; form\n&gt; &gt; of test dependencies or spaghetti code, or some other code-smell. \n&gt; Sorry\n&gt; &gt; if that sounds harsh -- I am certainly not trying to be\njudgemental,\n&gt; &gt; just reflective.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =jason\n&gt; &gt; [:question | ^One] \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; &gt; From: Kendall Collett [mailto:przkiie02@s...] \n&gt; &gt; Sent: Friday, January 03, 2003 12:41 PM\n&gt; &gt; To: junit@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; &gt; Sebjest: Re: [junit] Re: Conditional tearDown()\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I could use a conditional clean-up in tearDown, for exactly the\nsame\n&gt; &gt; reason\n&gt; &gt; as Brian.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; When I first ran into this issue; I didn&#39;t think of trying to make\n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; tearDown() clean-up conditional.
