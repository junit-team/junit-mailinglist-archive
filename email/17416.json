Can JUnit run test methods in a particular order?<br/>\n<br/>\nNo. JUnit makes no promises whatsoever regarding the order in which<br/>\ntest methods are executed. This is by design--JUnit supports the<br/>\nprinciple of test independence.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOn 8/14/06, huaishih_wen &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:hwen@...\">hwen@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;  2. What is the best approach to unit test database code?<br/>\n&gt;  3. What is the best approach to unit test threaded program?<br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s no right answer to these questions. It would help, though, if<br/>\nwe could look at a concrete example.<br/>\n<br/>\nHaving said that, the short answer to 2) is that you might want to<br/>\nlook into mock objects and consider running tests for database code<br/>\nagainst a lightweight, embedded database such as HSQLDB. The short<br/>\nanswer to 3) is, &quot;separate the threading logic from what code the<br/>\nthreads are executing, test the sequential code as usual, and learn<br/>\nthe Java Thread API inside out to figure out how to test the threading<br/>\nlogic enough to gain a degree of confidence.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI happen to be in the process of writing longer &quot;answers&quot; to these<br/>\nquestions into what will become a book on test-driven development but<br/>\nI&#39;m afraid it&#39;ll still take a few months before it&#39;s going to be<br/>\navailable.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Lasse- </span></blockquote></div>",
