    "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-382085884\">Thanks for the help.  In my case, Spring Test does an automatic transaction rollback after every test method, so there are no dependencies between tests -- so thats not a problem.  Because of the rollback, it is also the case that they order of the test runs also doesn&#39;t matter.  The database is reset to a &quot;known&quot; state after each test method by the transactional rollback.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d just like to load the data once rather than 50 times.  But the @BeforeClass requirement to be a static method makes it impossible to use.   Is there any trigger that can run after a class is initialized by Spring and before any test method is executed?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a>, Mike Forsberg &lt;bigmike.f@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I would advise against that unless you were following the following guide<br/>\n&gt; lines....<br/>\n&gt; - No test method (or called method) manipulates the data base.<br/>\n&gt; - The order of the test methods do not cause conflicts with each other with<br/>\n&gt; required data being there.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Some things I&#39;d try before doing the @BeforeClass<br/>\n&gt; - Only populate the data you need for a given set of tests.  (Don&#39;t populate<br/>\n&gt; the _whole_ database.)<br/>\n&gt; - Which of the DBUnit population features are you using... I think there is<br/>\n&gt; one that will revert to a known state, without the delete and insert.  This<br/>\n&gt; may save some time.<br/>\n&gt; - Try to use a non-commitable transaction for testing.  After all, one<br/>\n&gt; shouldn&#39;t need to test the commit functionality.  If that breaks more than<br/>\n&gt; just you will have problems.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Hope I helped,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Big Mike<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; On Wed, Jun 30, 2010 at 8:32 PM, hdave321321 &lt;hdave321321@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; My DAO integration tests are taking a long time to run.
