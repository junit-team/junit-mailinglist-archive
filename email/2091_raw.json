One of the key requirements of unit\n&gt; testing is &quot;Report for each test only &#39;pass&#39; or &#39;fail&#39;.&quot;\n\nReally? Then why does JUnit report the Exception? Why is reporting more\nthan one such assertion failure not more useful than only reporting the\nfirst? How is reporting two assertion failures different from a test\nthat manages to pack multiple booleans into a single assertTrue and\npass back the extra failure information in the message?\n\nIs it really so evil to report more information in a failure that could\nbe used for solving the problem without invoking the debuggger. I hate\ndebuggers. Even fast and good ones take a lot of time and effort to get\nto the problem (I know, I should use VAJ, but that&#39;s not how things\nhave evolved here; in part due to the integrated source control and\nsome initial problems with VM thrashing we had, VAJ got tossed). If I\nget a complete assertion failure report, I might (and often have) been\nable to fix the bug immediately.\n\nI remain unconvinced that this feature is necessary, but it seems to me\nthat we should dismiss it so quickly simply because it&#39;s hard or it\ndoesn&#39;t fit our personal definition of unit test.\n\nRegards,\n\nRob\n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nMake international calls for as low as $.04/minute with Yahoo!
