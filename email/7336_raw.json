Not sure how you could close the connection at\n&gt;&gt; the end of the last test method executed, though. Has anyone used\n&gt;&gt; static variables to share fixture objects among multiple test methods?\n&gt;\n&gt; I did this very thing by accident - as I&#39;m new to JUnit testing.\n&gt;\n&gt; I have legacy DB code I have to test and the original author used a  \n&gt; static anonymous class to\n&gt; create the connection cache.  I use setup() to instantiate the  \n&gt; underlying class and get/close my\n&gt; DB connections in each test.  I pay the penalty for the connection  \n&gt; creation in the first test, but\n&gt; every other test is fairly fast.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; So far, I&#39;ve found JUnits testing of each test method to be low level  \n&gt; in design and nature...  I\n&gt; create a method in an object and my test methods exercise my method -  \n&gt; checking for validity of\n&gt; execution.  I&#39;ve found JUnit assumes I&#39;m interested in assuring the  \n&gt; tested method executes and\n&gt; provides some specific result.\n&gt;\n&gt; Maybe I&#39;m still too new to JUnit to know what I&#39;m missing with  \n&gt; SuiteRunner - but I&#39;ve always\n&gt; thought the first test I must *always* perform is the validation of my  \n&gt; code against the\n&gt; specifications - that what I&#39;m writing is performing to expectations.\n&gt;\n&gt; Your right, if I write code that modifies a part of my object in some  \n&gt; way, I need to insure that I\n&gt; haven&#39;t created an artifact that can damage some other part of the  \n&gt; code.  Isn&#39;t that the basis of\n&gt; performing lots of different asserts in each of your tests?  If I can  \n&gt; alter some part of my object\n&gt; thru my code, then after my code runs, don&#39;t I want to verify the  \n&gt; contents of the underlying\n&gt; object?  All within one test? (Not Suite of tests - but an individual  \n&gt; test...)\n&gt;\n&gt; If I&#39;m too far off topic, please forgive me.\n&gt;\nNot off topic at all. I was asking if anyone had used static members to  \nshare fixture among multiple test methods in a single TestCase, and you  \ndid. You even did it for a database connection, which was the example I  \nmentioned. The one question I still have about your test code is, did  \nyou find a way to explicitly close the connection after the last test  \nmethod finished? Or was it just left open under the assumption your app  \nwould go away soon enough.\n\nOne significant difference between the static member approach to  \nfixture sharing in JUnit and SuiteRunner is that I know how to close  \nthe connection when I&#39;m done in SuiteRunner, but not in JUnit. If  \nanyone has a way to do that, please reply.\n\nAnother difference is really one of design taste I suspect. I just  \nfound it non-intuitive that JUnit gave each test method invocation its  \nown instance, especially when they also provided the setUp() method. I  \nused JUnit a long time before I realized this object wrapping was going  \non. In a previous post to this list, I asked if anyone could help me  \nunderstand what benefit I get for that wrapping. I mentioned that the  \nonly benefit I could see was that if I screw up my  setUp() and  \ntearDown() methods and don&#39;t actually initialize and clean up the  \nfixture correctly, the wrapping of method invocations may let me get  \naway with it. Vladimir Bossicard agreed that that was a benefit, and no  \none else offered any others.\n\nMy design sense when I was doing that part of SuiteRunner was to not  \nprovide the extra shield. I figured it would be relatively rare that a  \nuser would screw up their setUpFixture() and tearDownFixture() methods.  \nWhen they do, they get a red bar and can fix the bug like any other  \nbug. Then they get a green bar. And all the while the hierarchy of  \nobjects that make up their test is the intuitive simple tree of objects  \nthat for a long time (until I realized that the object wrapping was  \ngoing on) I imagined JUnit was building.\n\nBill\n\n&gt; Bob\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; __________________________________________________\n&gt; Do you Yahoo!?\n&gt; Yahoo!
