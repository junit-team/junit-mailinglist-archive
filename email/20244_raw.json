Write a test to manifest each reported bug before\n&gt; doing anything t=\r\no fix it.  These will often be of the end-to-end or\n&gt; integration variety a=\r\nlready recommended.  \n&gt; \n&gt; Besides accumulating a regression suite, this ha=\r\ns a couple of other\n&gt; benefits.  First, bugs tend to occur in clusters, so =\r\nyou&#39;ll tend to\n&gt; accumulate the most tests for the most problematic code.  =\r\n  Second,\n&gt; the code that is the most problematic will probably also be the=\r\n\n&gt; hardest to test, encouraging refactoring.  Again, focusing on bug\n&gt; hot-=\r\nspots tends to focus your efforts where they&#39;re needed most.\n&gt; \n&gt; Good hunt=\r\ning,\n&gt; Lance\n\nI&#39;m starting to understand what the relationship is between d=\r\nesigning\nand testing...\n\nSome weeks ago I read about a commercial testing t=\r\nool that enables you\nto write interface(GUI)-tests through JUnit tests, it =\r\nsounds quite\nstrange (to use JUnit for end-to-end/integration testing)...\n\n=\r\nThanks, Lance\n  csaba\n\n\n\n",
