While I am able to <br/>\ncreate and execute simple test cases, what I am really looking to do is <br/>\nto test my classes in their real-world environment: packaged in jar files.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m unclear, however, how to do this. If I run an Ant build, and create <br/>\na jar file with all the classes in it (as I always do), how do I then <br/>\nrun the jUnit tests against the classes in this .jar?<br/>\n<br/>\nI suspect it has something to do with making adding a jUnit task to the <br/>\nAnt build file that contains a &quot;java -cp...&quot; style command pointing to <br/>\nthe files in the jar? Is this the right way to go? Does anyone have a <br/>\nsample build file that does this?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for any help. I look forward to improving my code using unit tests.<br/>\nM.</div>",
