I did load tests using &quot;The<br/>\nGrinder 3&quot; (can be found at sourceforge), which is free. There are a<br/>\nlot of open source load testing tools, so they are not necessarily<br/>\nexpensive. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; * to which level of granularity, e.g.<br/>\n&gt;   - methods of single classes; or of facade classes hiding a<br/>\n </span></blockquote>complete<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &quot;system&quot;;<br/>\n&gt;   - single web page clicks, or whole work-flows;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>That is to be determined and I know only we can do that. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; * to which level of quality, e.g.<br/>\n&gt;   - only critical functions (e.g. defined by &quot;draw most bug reports<br/>\n </span></blockquote>in the<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; last 3 monts&quot;);<br/>\n&gt;   - everything to some coverage level; then you need to decide on <br/>\n&gt;   -- the coverage level (&quot;80%&quot; is in &quot;industry standard&quot;; &quot;100%<br/>\n </span></blockquote>feasible<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; coverage&quot; is the only sensible standard)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I assume the level of quality depends on the level of granularity. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;   -- the type of coverage (code coverage; or some &quot;feature coverage&quot;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>- all<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; the features down written in some specification or documentation)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Code coverage is not an issue here but &quot;feature coverage&quot; is.
