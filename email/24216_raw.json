The main driver for this is that a test\nis a named bloc=\r\nk, and reflectively-retrieved methods have, until now, been\nby far the chea=\r\npest syntactic way to create a named block.\n\nWith lambdas, you can now enab=\r\nle an even cheaper named-block syntax:\n\ntest(&quot;Here&#39;s my test name&quot;, () -&gt; {=\r\n\n  assertTheRightThings();\n});\n\nNow, rather than having to enable all kinds=\r\n of weird annotation-driven\nextension schemes, extensions can be built in t=\r\nhe natural Java way, through\nfunction composition and inheritance.  Create =\r\na paramTest function, and\nyou&#39;ve got parameterized tests:\n\nparamTest(&quot;Name&quot;=\r\n, computeParameters(), (param1, param2) -&gt; {\n   assertTheRightThing(param1,=\r\n param2);\n}\n\nPush further, and the line between assertions and tests begins=\r\n to look a\nlittle fuzzy.  I&#39;m not sure what lies beyond that particular qua=\r\nntum limit,\nthough.  :-)\n\nFYI, note that QUnit is a JavaScript test framewo=\r\nrk that does take this\napproach (http://qunitjs.com/cookbook/).\n\nIn general=\r\n, the first few test frameworks that get released for a language\noften incl=\r\nude at least one whose chief advantage is its familiarity for\nXUnit users*;=\r\n later, many users often settle into a framework that fits the\ngrain of the=\r\n language better.  Since I&#39;ve never been able to figure out\nwhat the grain =\r\nof JavaScript is, I can&#39;t say which frameworks are in which\ncamp.\n\n   David=\r\n Saff\n\n*  (the most extreme example being .NET: NUnit&#39;s first release was a=\r\n\nmethod-name-for-method-name clone of JUnit (3.7?), down to methods designe=\r\nd\nto detect if the test was running on the quirky VisualAge VM, which had n=\r\no\n.NET equivalent)\n\n\nOn Thu, Jan 10, 2013 at 12:05 PM, Kevin Cooney &lt;kcoone=\r\ny@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt; **\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; On Jan 10, 2013 8:21 AM, &quot;tibord47&quot; tibord=\r\n47@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Hi Jens,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I have to only agree.=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The time is getting still shorter for Java 8 release, and thus mis=\r\nsing it\n&gt; would mean that JUnit as a nice framework will be too old.\n&gt;\n&gt; To=\r\no old? Really?\n&gt;\n&gt; I think we have some time. There was some delay between =\r\nTestNG being\n&gt; released and the release of JUnit 4.0, but JUnit 4 still got=\r\n adopted.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Also agree with David that watching the steps of othe=\r\nr new frameworks is\n&gt; important as well.\n&gt;\n&gt; I was thinking about that. Jav=\r\naScript is a functional language, but all of\n&gt; the JS test frameworks that =\r\nI am aware of use JUnit-like syntax for\n&gt; defining test cases (JsUnit defin=\r\nes test functions at global scope,\n&gt; JsTestDriver uses methods on a class).=\r\n If functional programming could\n&gt; change the paradigm for defining tests, =\r\nyou would think it would have\n&gt; happened in JavaScript.\n&gt;\n&gt; Am I missing so=\r\nmething?\n&gt;\n&gt; Sure, you could use functional programming to write more power=\r\nful\n&gt; assertions, but that could be done in an assertion framework.\n&gt;\n&gt; The=\r\n places I see where functional programming could help are Theories\n&gt; and pa=\r\nrametrised tests. I think we could do that in JUnit4 with at most a\n&gt; new c=\r\nore Runner.\n&gt;\n&gt; Sure, there are many parts of the implementation of JUnit 4=\r\n that I would\n&gt; love to change, but building a new Java test framework from=\r\n scratch would\n&gt; be a large effort. One often-forgotten piece is all the to=\r\noling (IDE\n&gt; integration, build tool integration, etc).\n&gt;\n&gt; - Kevin\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; The modularity, as somebody mentioned, has to be also considered, but\n=\r\n&gt; without knowing the outcome it is quite difficult.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; So perhaps tem=\r\nplate tests under new languages without having a framework\n&gt; should be writ=\r\nten first to see what wants to be reached.\n&gt; &gt; Features and goals from othe=\r\nr projects should be considered.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; BR, Tibor\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; --- In junit@yah=\r\noogroups.com, &quot;jens_schauder&quot; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; It looks like Closure will=\r\n finally find their way into Java. With this\n&gt; feature many nice ways to do=\r\n thing become possible. Therefore I am\n&gt; wondering if other people agree th=\r\nat it might be time for a JUnit5 putting\n&gt; this new feature to good use.\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; A source for inspiration for me in this regard are the FunSuite o=\r\nf\n&gt; ScalaTest http://www.scalatest.org/getting_started_with_fun_suite\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; There a test definition is a method call (instead of a method\n&gt; defi=\r\nnition in JUnit) that registers a test for execution. It looks roughly\n&gt; li=\r\nke this:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; class MyTestClass{\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; test(&quot;The test na=\r\nme&quot;){\n&gt; &gt; &gt; // the actual test goes here\n&gt; &gt; &gt; }\n&gt; &gt; &gt; }\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; With t=\r\nhis approach things like Rules become extremly trivial, since all\n&gt; you hav=\r\ne to do is wrap the code block (i.e. closure) in a new new code\n&gt; block.\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Also parameterized test become fairly easy, because you would jus=\r\nt put\n&gt; the call to test in a loop.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; What do you think? Is this =\r\nan interesting direction for JUnit to go?\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; kind regards\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Je=\r\nns\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n=\r\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n",
