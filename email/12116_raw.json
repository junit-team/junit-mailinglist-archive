There is no \npublished generic methodology (like COCOMO) for estimating the effort of \nadding tests that I&#39;m aware of.\n\nThe best I can suggest is to conduct some experiments. See how much of \nthe system you can test in a week. This will give you a rough idea, at \nany rate. Even then, it is possible that you&#39;ll find a refactoring in \nweek three that makes the rest of the system much, much easier to test. \nThat is more likely than the reverse -- in other words, the cost of \ntesting a system tends to go down as you cover more of the system with \ntests. (This is a slight simplification, but it&#39;s true enough for you at \nthis moment.)\n-- \nJ. B.
