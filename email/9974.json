I guess externalizing data is my last <br/>\nresort.  I start with individual test case methods with common code <br/>\nrefactored into a custom assertion.  I start there partly because it&#39;s <br/>\neasier for me to see the data and the assertion side by side in a test <br/>\nmethod.  And I name the test methods according to why the specific <br/>\npiece of data is important to test.  So if a test fails, I know by <br/>\nlooking at the method name what went wrong.<br/>\n<br/>\nRarely do I find that I have enough permutations of data to justify <br/>\nexternalizing the data.  But when that does happen, I externalize it.  <br/>\nEven in that case I don&#39;t use a parameterized test case.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve seen the parameterized test case used.  I&#39;ve never had occasion to <br/>\nuse it myself.  Perhaps it&#39;s my testing style.  I&#39;m using this as an <br/>\nopportunity to question why I don&#39;t use parameterized test case, not as <br/>\nan opportunity to caution you not to use it.<br/>\n<br/>\nMike</div>",
