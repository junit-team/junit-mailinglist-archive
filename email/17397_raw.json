Quality code only comes=\r\n from\n&gt; using TDD.\n\n\nAgain, this is a very bold claim, and one that is easy=\r\n to challenge.\n\nAssume that you write a high-quality product using TDD, I c=\r\nan write this\nexact same high-quality product using all your same tests, ex=\r\ncept I won&#39;t\nhave written them first.  And voila, high-quality software wit=\r\nhout ever\nusing TDD.\n\nThe truth is:  the main impact that TDD has when you =\r\ndevelop software is on\nits design, not its quality.  Hence the last &quot;D&quot; in =\r\n&quot;TDD&quot;.  I definitely\nbelieve that software written using TDD will have a ve=\r\nry different\narchitecture from another software delivered with standard tes=\r\nting\ntechniques (&quot;write the code, write the test, repeat&quot;).  But until you =\r\ntake a\nlook at the tests themselves, you can&#39;t compare their quality just b=\r\nased on\nthe testing methodology that was used.  After all, someone could be=\r\n claiming\nto do TDD and only write one test (or tests that do no asserts) w=\r\nhile the\nother non-TDD person will have written 1000 tests, and will theref=\r\nore come\nup with higher quality code.\n\nI also believe that &quot;the simplest th=\r\ning that can possibly work&quot; can lead to\nvery bad design, but I&#39;ll save this=\r\n for a different thread.\n\n-- \nC=E9dric\nhttp://testng.org\n\n\n[Non-text portio=\r\nns of this message have been removed]\n\n\n",
