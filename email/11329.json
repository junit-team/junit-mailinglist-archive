I&#39;m a 16-year-old high school student at Troy <br/>\nHigh School, in Fullerton, CA (Class of &#39;05).  Over the past half-<br/>\nyear or so, I have been working with my AP Computer Science teacher, <br/>\nDave Wittry, on a project to make JUnit testing more accessible to <br/>\nboth teachers and students called JAM*Tester (JUnit Auto-Matic <br/>\nTester).<br/>\n<br/>\nWe just recently released the Student Version of our tool, which may <br/>\nbe useful to more than just students.  Its goal is to aid in the <br/>\ncreation of JUnit TestCases.  It also runs the tests and reports <br/>\nJUnit results.  Additionally, it provides some code-coverage <br/>\nreporting, which can be extremely useful (fyi: code-coverage provided <br/>\nin part by Clover <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.thecortex.net/clover)\">http://www.thecortex.net/clover)</a>.<br/>\n<br/>\nAdditionally, we have the Teacher Version of the tool.  The idea <br/>\nbehind this is that a Teacher can create a battery of tests for their <br/>\nstudents&#39; labs (possibly using the Student Version), and then <br/>\nautomatically compile and run the tests for all of their students at <br/>\nonce.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you&#39;re interested, please come to our website, <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.jamtester.com\">http://www.jamtester.com</a>  We would appreciate any feedback you may <br/>\nhave for us.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks in advance for your support,<br/>\nDavid</div>",
