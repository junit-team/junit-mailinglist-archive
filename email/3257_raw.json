I then compiled \nTestTest \n&gt; and ProxyTestSuite using the provided jars and ran TestTest. My \n&gt; problem is that I don&#39;t seem to be able to get testSharing() to \n&gt; share. The initial value of sharing is false. Enter the first round \n&gt; of testSharing(), the assertion is confirmed and sharing is set to \n&gt; true. Enter the second testSharing(), the value is false again, as \n&gt; would be expected with the plain vanilla JUnit.\n&gt; \n&gt; Can someone point me to the correct path?\n&gt; \n&gt; Regards,\n&gt; Richard\n\n\n",
