I<br/>\nguess for a team new to JUnit-based testing, the productivity will be<br/>\ndecreased at the begining. But I have no ideas how much extra effort<br/>\nit would be. So I may pick a small-sized project to try and find out<br/>\nfrom the real coding / testing. <br/>\n<br/>\nCheers, <br/>\n- Frank<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a>, CÃ©dric Beust â  &lt;cbeust@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Fascinating questions, Frank :-)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; A few thoughts.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;    - Will thorough testing make the project take longer?  Of course it<br/>\n&gt;    will.  Either in time or in programmers.  After all, we are<br/>\ntalking about<br/>\n&gt;    writing more code, so the number of man.months is going to go up as<br/>\n&gt;    well.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;    The way to solve this problem is to include testing in the planning<br/>\n&gt;    and project features and deadlines accordingly, but for having<br/>\nbeen there as<br/>\n&gt;    well, I agree that it&#39;s not always possible.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;    - Using debuggers less might be a good thing *if* the developers find<br/>\n&gt;    bugs faster.  I have seen quite a few TDD enthusiasts choose not<br/>\nto use<br/>\n&gt;    debuggers for dogmatic reasons (&quot;because I read it in a book&quot;)<br/>\nand then<br/>\n&gt;    spend hours writing tests or even println&#39;s trying to reproduce a<br/>\nmysterious<br/>\n&gt;    bug that a breakpoint would have caught in a few minutes.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;    Again, the solution here is to be pragmatic:  you have two tools at<br/>\n&gt;    your disposal (testing and debugger), both with their pros and<br/>\ncons, and<br/>\n&gt;    you&#39;d be a fool to choose to use only one.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --<br/>\n&gt; Cedric<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://testng.org\">http://testng.org</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>",
