It seems like<br/>\n&gt; &gt; this is a case of overzealous use of the new parameterized types in<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Java 5 and a regression from JUnit 3.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;d say merely mistaken, rather than overzealous.  :-)  Submit a bug<br/>\n&gt; report, and it should be easy to fix in 4.5.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Done.  And I didn&#39;t mean to sound critical - being overzealous is no<br/>\ncrime in my book.  After all, aren&#39;t you all test-obsessed?  :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; Also, in JUnit 3 the method loadSuiteClass() called getLoader() to get<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the ClassLoader to use, which opened the door for extensibility.  This<br/>\n&gt; &gt; is gone now, why?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Can&#39;t say the why.  Can you open another bug, perhaps with a test<br/>\n&gt; you&#39;d like to see compile and pass?  Thanks,<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;m not sure this issue really is a bug.  I suspect the move was<br/>\nintentional, but I would recommend that instead of just removing the<br/>\ngetLoader() method, it should have been deprecated.  As I mentioned in<br/>\nthe bug report, this came to light when attempting to use JUnit 4.4<br/>\nwith Cactus tests.  I suspect this is just the tip of the iceberg of<br/>\nthe issues which I&#39;m sure have already been investigated by others.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Bruno</div>",
