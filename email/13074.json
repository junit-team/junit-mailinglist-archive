When these attributes are &quot;no&quot;, the<br/>\nlog4j output is captured by the &lt;junit&gt; task in the XML output as<br/>\nexpected.  When these attributes are &quot;yes&quot;, the log4j output is not<br/>\ncaptured, although direct output to System.out is.<br/>\n<br/>\nI can see where this attribute might effect the output, however, I<br/>\nwould imagine the effect being the opposite.  For example, when not<br/>\nforking a new JVM, I could see where the log4j loaded by JUnit would<br/>\nbe shared with the log4j loaded by ANT and there might be some<br/>\ninterference.  When the process is forked however, I do not see how<br/>\nthere would be a negative interaction.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d appreciate any enlightment :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\nRay</div>",
