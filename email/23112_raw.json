Then later, if I find some ex=\r\ntra time,\n&gt; I&#39;ll try to write a few unit tests that will allow me to conver=\r\nge toward\n&gt; problems faster. Because that&#39;s all unit tests enable: faster p=\r\ninpointing of\n&gt; a problem. If 100% of your tests are functional, you will s=\r\ntill find the\n&gt; problem but it might take you a little longer. Not a big de=\r\nal.\n&gt;\n&gt; It&#39;s unfortunate that unit tests have become such a high focus of a=\r\nttention\n&gt; lately (and another reason why TDD makes me uncomfortable). High=\r\n emphasis on\n&gt; unit tests and on TDD is engineers trying to make their work=\r\n easier. It&#39;s a\n&gt; laudable goal, but it should never come at the expense of=\r\n the person whom\n&gt; you are working for: the customer.\n&gt;\n&gt; And the only test=\r\ns that really matter to the customer are functional tests.\n\nI tend to try m=\r\nany different approaches to software development, since\nI plan to be doing =\r\nit for decades to come, and don&#39;t want to get stuck\nin a local maximum.  I =\r\npay special attention to techniques that people\nI trust say good things abo=\r\nut, but I haven&#39;t tried, or haven&#39;t been\nsuccessful with.  At this point, I=\r\n find that test-driven development,\nwith the discipline of changing my desi=\r\ngn when writing the unit tests\nhurts, produces the highest-quality software=\r\n at the highest speed.  I\nexpect I&#39;ll continue to try variations on the for=\r\nmula and others.\n\nThis isn&#39;t the first time that Cedric and I have discusse=\r\nd this\nparticular point, so you can probably refer to previous mails on thi=\r\ns\nlist if I don&#39;t expand every thought here.\n\n- Most engineers and craftsme=\r\nn consider it professional to have\nstructures they use during design and co=\r\nnstruction that make their job\neasier, but might not obviously contribute t=\r\no final quality from an\noutsider&#39;s perspective.  Home contractors might use=\r\n scaffolding,\ntemporary lighting, pencil marks on the walls, clamps.  As a =\r\ncustomer,\nI do not begrudge these tools, saying &quot;without that temporary\nlig=\r\nhting, you&#39;ll probably make more mistakes, and it might take you\nlonger to =\r\nfind them and fix them, but eventually it will get done.&quot;\n\n- On being &quot;pres=\r\nsed for time&quot;: I assume that a very experienced auto\nengineer can make a pr=\r\nofessional decision, when pressed for time,\nabout whether to thoroughly tes=\r\nt the airbags in my car using crash\ntest dummies, or using a more isolated =\r\nlab test.  I also really hope\nthat if both are valuable, a very professiona=\r\nl auto engineer makes\nsure there&#39;s time in the schedule for both, and doesn=\r\n&#39;t spend a lot of\ntime arguing with peers about which to drop in order to s=\r\nhorten the\nschedule.\n\n- No tests matter to the customer.  Working software =\r\nmatters to the\ncustomer.  What produces working software is a matter best\ni=\r\nnvestigated through history and experience.\n\nThanks,\n\n   David\n\n&gt;\n&gt; --\n&gt; C=\r\n=C3=A9dric\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt;\n&gt;\n=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
