Check out the Channel and\nFutureResult classes if you want to pass something back to the main\nthread (e.g. an event object) in order to assert something.\n\nNevertheless, multithreaded testing is a pain in the neck and I have\nsince converted these tests to be single threaded.\n\n- Neil Swingler\n\n\n--- In junit@yahoogroups.com, Michael Schuerig &lt;michael@s...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m working on a class that interacts with the Spring framework&#39;s \n&gt; application context and the Quartz scheduler. I&#39;m pretty new to the \n&gt; latter, thus I&#39;m testing my understanding of Quartz just as much as I&#39;m \n&gt; testing my code. In effect, I can&#39;t (yet) build the fixture for my code \n&gt; completely with mocks as I have to ascertain what these mocks are \n&gt; supposed to do first.\n&gt; \n&gt; The complication here is that Quartz uses its own &quot;hidden&quot; thread(s) to \n&gt; fulfill its duties. It is such a thread that effects the change that I \n&gt; need to check for. As I don&#39;t want to test Quartz, of course, I&#39;m \n&gt; content with checking that my scheduled job is executed at all. Thus I \n&gt; schedule it for immediate execution, wait for 2 secs to give Quartz \n&gt; some time before the fixture is torn down again.\n&gt; \n&gt; Now, all this works surprisingly well. Still, I don&#39;t like the part of \n&gt; waiting some arbitrary time.\n&gt; \n&gt; (Thinking break)\n&gt; \n&gt; After getting this far, I remembered that Doug Lea&#39;s concurrency utils \n&gt; have made their way into J2SE 5.0 and there I found just what I needed: \n&gt; java.util.concurrent.CountDownLatch\n&gt; \n&gt; Now I have a TestCase that looks in outline like this\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; public class MultiThreadedTest extends TestCase {\n&gt;     private static CountDownLatch latch;\n&gt;     private MyMock mock;\n&gt; \n&gt;     protected void setUp() {\n&gt;         latch = new CountDownLatch(1);\n&gt;         mock = new MyMock();\n&gt;     }\n&gt; \n&gt;     public void testMe() throws Exception {\n&gt;         startSomeWorkInAnotherThread(mock);\n&gt;         latch.await(); // some timeout might be prudent\n&gt;         mock.verify();\n&gt;     }\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;     private static class MyMock implements Whatever {\n&gt;         private boolean wasCalled = false;\n&gt; \n&gt;         public void methodCalledFromOtherThread() {\n&gt;             wasCalled = true;\n&gt;             latch.countDown();\n&gt;         }\n&gt; \n&gt;         public void verify() {\n&gt;             assertTrue(wasCalled);\n&gt;         }\n&gt;     }\n&gt; }\n&gt; \n\n\n\n\n\n",
