The place where people mess up is when they reflexively assum=\r\ne that particular numbers indicate problems and that there is some sort of =\r\nmoral imperative to confront all perceived problems.  The fact is, there is=\r\n no linkage there other than what we bring to the table.  People and teams =\r\nhave natural rhythms and we have to take care when we decide what to optimi=\r\nze. \n\nThe fact that people are less productive on one particular day out of=\r\n the week would not surprise me.  If someone told me that a team was unifor=\r\nmly productive every day of the week, I&#39;d actually be rather scared of what=\r\n I might find if I was to visit them.\n\nMichael\n\n-----Original Message-----\n=\r\n&gt;From: Mike Hill &lt;mike@...&gt;\n&gt;Sent: Jun 10, 2008 11:39 AM\n&gt;T=\r\no: junit@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;Subject: A Note On Data-Gathering (Was Re: [junit=\r\n] A case for adding logging of assertions to junit)\n&gt;\n&gt;On Tue, Jun 10, 2008=\r\n at 10:07 AM, Kent Beck &lt;kentb@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt; This is what DevCre=\r\nek (www.devcreek.com) does, and the results are often\n&gt;&gt; surprising. For ex=\r\nample, we noticed that on Wednesdays the DevCreek team\n&gt;&gt; itself wrote a qu=\r\narter of the tests it wrote on other days. Turns out they\n&gt;&gt; were spending =\r\nmost of the day preparing for the weekly status meeting.\n&gt;\n&gt;So.  Side topic=\r\n, and favorite horse-floggee of mine:  did the metric\n&gt;do anything for us t=\r\nhat simply knowing the team well wouldn&#39;t have\n&gt;already done?  I&#39;m assuming=\r\n, here, dangerous habit, that there was no\n&gt;team-perceived process-weakness=\r\n on Wednesdays prior to the metric.  If\n&gt;that&#39;s a valid assumption, dangero=\r\nus habit admitted, then this would\n&gt;seem to be a case where a metric -- not=\r\n free -- gave us a false\n&gt;positive -- not free -- requiring at least a litt=\r\nle bit of\n&gt;investigation to determine root cause -- not free.  Metrics are\n=\r\n&gt;scarily complex to me, and I wish my world had either fewer of them,\n&gt;or f=\r\newer people relying on them.\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Teams\n&gt;&gt; using DevCreek don&#39;t seem to cha=\r\nnge their behavior much on the basis of the\n&gt;&gt; feedback, though, which I fi=\r\nnd surprising. Perhaps the feedback isn&#39;t really\n&gt;&gt; all that useful, perhap=\r\ns we don&#39;t have the right presentation of the\n&gt;&gt; information, or perhaps pe=\r\nople just need to get used to the idea that the\n&gt;&gt; information is there for=\r\n them.\n&gt;\n&gt;Or, another favorite equine victim of mine, perhaps people are\n&gt;d=\r\necidedly less rational than we routinely realize.\n&gt;\n&gt;Of course, once having=\r\n typed this in, I immediately jump to another\n&gt;way of seeing it:  put scare=\r\n quotes around &#39;rational&#39;.  To make this\n&gt;second idea more clear, I&#39;ll say =\r\nI might have theorized that the team\n&gt;would respond (incorrectly) by &#39;ratio=\r\nnally&#39; honoring feedback that\n&gt;didn&#39;t meet its -- what words to use here? -=\r\n- gestalt self-image.  In\n&gt;fact, the team responded (correctly) by &#39;irratio=\r\nnally&#39; ignoring\n&gt;feedback that didn&#39;t meet that gestalt self-image.\n&gt;\n&gt;A th=\r\nird way in to the puzzle:  information is not useful until it is\n&gt;integrate=\r\nd into a framework of meaning.  At any given time, any such\n&gt;framework has =\r\na loose boundary (the so-called hermeneutic horizon),\n&gt;which represents the=\r\n only possible locations where new information can\n&gt;be fit.  If the boundar=\r\ny is not situated where the new information can\n&gt;be fit in, it will be igno=\r\nred, hence useless.  So it pays to focus\n&gt;one&#39;s attention not just on gener=\r\nating data, but on generating the\n&gt;data that will fit the current boundary =\r\nfor the current group and\n&gt;enable that group to become what it wants.\n&gt;\n&gt;Th=\r\nis is why I am so negative about quests for ever-more-detailed\n&gt;metrics, or=\r\n one-size-fits-all approaches to measuring progress in\n&gt;human enterprise.  =\r\nDown this road lies Taylor, and a reversion of some\n&gt;particularly hard won =\r\n20th century knowledge.  When someone posts\n&gt;about &quot;what metric is best?&quot;, =\r\nI wish we could all post back &quot;the one\n&gt;that helps your team&quot;.\n&gt;\n&gt;I&#39;m remin=\r\nded of a magnificent insight granted to me by Jerome Bruner,\n&gt;who somewhere=\r\n remarks that the purpose of therapy is not to reveal the\n&gt;truth, but to co=\r\nnstruct a story which enables the patient to move\n&gt;towards his or her goal.=\r\n\n&gt;\n&gt;Cheers,\n&gt;Hill\n&gt;Wanna learn XP skills the hard way?
