This stance was taken out of respect for =93all the very smart=\r\n people\nwho&#39;ve been working with JUnit since 1999.=94  The reason that I as=\r\nked on this\nforum is to =93take some stock in what someone with experience =\r\nhas to say.=94 \nI was expecting some explanation of why this type of testin=\r\ng was not supported.\n Maybe that there were better paradigms that Junit pre=\r\nferred.  I was simply\ntrying to best understand a piece of software before =\r\nmoving on.\nI guess I&#39;m confused about your need to be condescending, especi=\r\nally since my\nmotivations to respect previous work, listen to experience, a=\r\nnd recognize\nsoftware limitations seem to line up pretty nicely with your v=\r\niews.\nThanks for you time, I guess I&#39;ll have to wait until you explain the =\r\nsolutions\nthat you alluded to.\n\n&gt; \n&gt; junityahoo@... wrote:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; \n&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; Is it so wrong to want to instantiate a test with some paramet=\r\ners and\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; automatically run the tests on it?\n&gt; &gt;  &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; No, but J=\r\nUnit was not designed that way.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; But I keep feeling like there must=\r\n be a way to get this behaviour out of \n&gt; &gt; JUnit\n&gt; &gt; and I am just missing=\r\n it.  I&#39;m willing to accept that it is a problem \n&gt; &gt; with me\n&gt; &gt; rather th=\r\nan JUnit.  Is there something about my outlook on testing that \n&gt; &gt; I need\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; to refine?  I am surprised that data driven testing like this is not \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; supported,\n&gt; &gt; as it seems like soemthign that would be used a lot.  Wha=\r\nt is the reasoning\n&gt; &gt; behind JUnit not beign designed for this, and is the=\r\nre soemthign that I \n&gt; &gt; can do\n&gt; &gt; to acheive what I want while still keep=\r\ning with JUnit&#39;s design goals.\n&gt; \n&gt; You&#39;re welcome to feel that way; I won&#39;=\r\nt press the issue anymore. It&#39;s \n&gt; entirely possible that all the very smar=\r\nt people who&#39;ve been working \n&gt; with JUnit since 1999 have missed what you&#39;=\r\nll eventually figure out. I \n&gt; have to allow for that possibility. Still, i=\r\nf I were you, I think I \n&gt; might take some stock in what someone with exper=\r\nience has to say.\n&gt; \n&gt; That said, highly data-driven testing /is/ supported=\r\n by JUnit, as long \n&gt; as you don&#39;t care about how it reports tests in test =\r\nruns. You could \n&gt; simply write this test:\n&gt; \n&gt; testAlgorithm\n&gt;      data =\r\n=3D some array\n&gt;      foreach (item in data)\n&gt;          doTest(item)\n&gt; \n&gt; T=\r\nhis works just fine, except:\n&gt; \n&gt; 1. If the algorithm fails for the 5th row=\r\n of data, you&#39;ll never know \n&gt; what happens with the 6th row, because the t=\r\nest will fail\n&gt; \n&gt; 2. Although you&#39;re really running n tests, JUnit will re=\r\nport it as only 1.\n&gt; \n&gt; If you don&#39;t care about these so-called limitations=\r\n, then you&#39;re done.\n&gt; \n&gt; Now you /can/ run all your test*() methods for eac=\r\nh row in a List of \n&gt; fixture objects, but I don&#39;t want to get into the det=\r\nails of how until I \n&gt; have time to sit down and write an article about it.=\r\n Today&#39;s not the day.\n&gt; \n&gt; Finally, you were earlier talking about somethin=\r\ng like instantiating and \n&gt; running a test from some other test. JUnit /def=\r\ninitely/ don&#39;t work that \n&gt; way. Don&#39;t even bother. Tests do not run other =\r\ntests; that&#39;s why we have \n&gt; test runners.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;  &gt; This is a different pr=\r\noblem from the one you described before, so it&#39;s a\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; different one fro=\r\nm what I tried to help you solve.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Yes, that is why I tried to desc=\r\nribe it better.  I really appreciate \n&gt; &gt; your taking\n&gt; &gt; the time to under=\r\nstand what I am saying and help me.  I bought your book\n&gt; &gt; yesterday and I=\r\n plan to read it over the holidays.\n&gt; &gt; Alright I will look into FitNesse l=\r\nike you suggested.  But I still feel like\n&gt; &gt; there is either an issue with=\r\n JUnit or my understanding of it since I \n&gt; &gt; failed to\n&gt; &gt; make this work.=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; Understand that what I&#39;m about to say is a little harsh, but it&#39;s tru=\r\ne. \n&gt; I hope we&#39;re all mature enough to take it in the spirit in which it&#39;s=\r\n given:\n&gt; \n&gt;   * A sign of maturity in any profession is when we recognize =\r\nthe \n&gt; limitations of tools and work around them, often by finding better \n=\r\n&gt; tools. To try hopelessly to reshape every problem so that one tool \n&gt; sol=\r\nves it is wishful thinking. It&#39;s a phase we all go through and have \n&gt; to g=\r\net through.\n&gt; \n&gt; Four years ago, I was you, hoping that JUnit would do ever=\r\nything \n&gt; including massage my feet when I was tired.\n&gt; \n&gt; I hope Fit/FitNe=\r\nsse helps you solve the problem in a nicer way. If not, \n&gt; then just wait f=\r\nor my next recipe: &quot;Parameterized Test Suite&quot;. :)\n&gt; \n&gt; Take care.\n&gt; -- \n&gt; J=\r\n. B.
