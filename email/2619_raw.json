Each test will start the \napplication, login, and test a specific piece of functionality. At the start \nof each test I call the application&#39;s main() method, and at the end I call \nit&#39;s shutdown() method. The application was not designed such that main() can \nbe called multiple times. Doing so leads to duplicate daemon threads, and \npainfull initialization problems. Also, each test needs to start with an \ninitialized data base.\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom:\tsduan@...
