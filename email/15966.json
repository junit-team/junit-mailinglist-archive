Are you saying that (in your opinion)<br/>\n&gt; static languages are inherently safer than dynamic languages?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>That&#39;s not exactly what I said.  I was simply pointing out that in order to<br/>\nmake my code safer, I will always pick an approach that verifies A and B<br/>\nover one that only verifies A.  Seems to be simple common sense.<br/>\n<br/>\nHaving said that, your question made me wonder...  It&#39;s pretty easy to come<br/>\nup with examples of bugs that will be caught by the compiler but that might<br/>\nslip through in a dynamic language.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am trying to think of an opposite example, but right now, I&#39;m coming up<br/>\nempty, which tends to make me want to answer &quot;yes&quot; to your question. But<br/>\nI&#39;ll think a bit more about it.<br/>\n<br/>\nVery interesting question anyway.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nCédri<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",
