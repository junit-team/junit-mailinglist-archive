Kent says we&#39;re supposed to cycle through the\ntesting and coding stages a few times until our code has no bugs.  So what\nis there to track?  same goes for integration: providing we&#39;re developing in\nsmall enough chunks, of course.\n\nOr look at it another way: our failed tests are their own bug\ntrackingdevice.\n\nAutomatically populating a bug track database from failed tests would only\nmake sense when the people running the tests aren&#39;t the same people who are\ndeveloping the code, for instance users in UAT or a &quot;black box&quot; testing\ncell.  I don&#39;t think JUnit is sufficiently abstract for the former but I can\nsee that the latter could be writing their own JUnit suites (if they know\nJava).  In which case your question is simply a variant on the &quot;How do I log\noutput from JUnit?&quot; question, only instead of writing to a logfile you want\nto insert the results into an error tracking database.  How difficult that\nis depends on the database in question: if it&#39;s something proprietary like\nMerant Tracker I imagine there&#39;ll be a few more problems than if (like us)\nyou&#39;re using a homebrew system based on tables sitting in your development\nOracle DB.  The Bugzilla FAQ does say we write to the database using the\nMozilla XML API so it would be possible to do, but I think you&#39;ll be lucky\nto find anyone who&#39;s actually done it :P  \n\nrgds, APC \n\nA P Clarke \nConsultant\nCMG Admiral UK - Radio Spectrum International\nWyndham House \n189 Marsh Wall\nLondon \nE14 9SH\nTel: +44 (0)20 7211 0603\nFax: +44 (0)20 7211 0364\nMobile:-----------------------\nInternet communications are not secure and therefore CMG UK Ltd does not\naccept legal responsibility for the contents of this message.
