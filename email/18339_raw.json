Of course, Java makes 100%\n&gt; reliability impossible, but it would seem that examining the classpath\n&gt; could\n&gt; allow some magic to be worked. It would also seem the kind of problem that\n&gt; someone out there may have already solved. Anyone have a pointer?

I&#39;d like to create a junit ant task that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; just runs on my whole codebase, but not all of my classes will have\n&gt; &gt; &gt; test methods and I&#39;ll get an error for each class that doesn&#39;t (and I\n&gt; &gt; &gt; don&#39;t want to have to explictily add each class to my build.xml file\n&gt; &gt; &gt; when I add a test).\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; If I were to try to tackle this, I&#39;d be looking at how the ANT JUnit\n&gt; &gt; runner is structured.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Very approximately, it is like this:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;junit&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;test&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;fileset /&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;/test&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;/junit&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The &lt;junit&gt; task runs all the tests handed to it by one or more &lt;test&gt;\n&gt; &gt; elements. The &lt;test&gt; elements get their input from one or more nested\n&gt; &gt; &lt;filesets&gt;.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; So rather than having JUnit /not/ filter out the non-tests, I&#39;d have\n&gt; &gt; that logic in either a custom subclass of &lt;test&gt; or a custom &lt;fileset&gt;\n&gt; &gt; - or maybe even a customer selector within the fileset.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Even if you don&#39;t sprinkle tests throughout your fileset, it&#39;s kinda\n&gt; &gt; lame that you have to select tests by doing pattern matching on a\n&gt; &gt; .class or .java filename. It&#39;s also error-prone as I have found out\n&gt; &gt; way too many times.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I have often wanted to do something similar myself but have never\n&gt; &gt; gotten around to it.
