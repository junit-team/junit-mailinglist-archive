They told me to explore the\n&gt; possibility of using JUnit to unit test EJB.\n[...]\n&gt; Can any of you guys give a pointer on where is the best place to\n&gt; start looking for simple sample codes to run and play with ? I look\n&gt; into jakarta.cactus website, but they don;t offer step by step\n&gt; instructions on how to begin testing ejb. I don&#39;t even know how to\n&gt; pack EAR, WAR, or jar file.\n\nI would direct you back to the Cactus Web site, viz:\nhttp://jakarta.apache.org/cactus/writing/howto_ejb.html\n\nAnd read it more carefully, because the step by step instructions are there\nin a link.\n\nIf you don&#39;t know how to pack a jar file, what are you doing in this\ngraduate course testing EJBs?  Amazing!  I would run down to the bookstore\nand pick up a good book on J2EE development if I were you.  Just look for\none that explains how to use the jar command to create EJB jar files.  I\nknow there are similarly good free tutorials on the Internet.  I would\nrecommend the Sun J2EE tutorials, but they tend to show how to do assembly\nand deployment with their GUI tools, which won&#39;t teach you portable skills.\n\nIf you were on a job, I would say they gave the research project to the\n*wrong guy*.  How&#39;re you supposed to give a sound judgment as to whether\nJUnit is suitable for unit testing EJBs if you don&#39;t even know how to &quot;pack&quot;\na jar file?  Sorry, just trying to understand your position better and what\nthe motivations and pedagogical strategy of the teacher are.\n\nScott S.\n\n\n\n",
