The difference f=\r\nrom the example\nis that I created a concrete non-anonymous subclass of Filt=\r\ner, and it\nis passed the matching test names, which are provided as argumen=\r\nts to\nthe main() method of my test classes. These arguments are only\nprovid=\r\ned during focused testing and development, and are *very*\ndynamic. In norma=\r\nl operation, the filter I created from Kent&#39;s example\nis not even used.\n\nTh=\r\nanks for the input!\n\n--- In junit@yahoogroups.com, &quot;C=C3=A9dric Beust =E2=\r\n=99&quot; &quot; &lt;cbeust@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; On 8/9/06, Kent Beck &lt;kentb@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; Michael,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; You&#39;re right that the JUnit documentation needs to be =\r\nimproved.
