I&#39;m a 16-year-old high school student at Troy\n&gt; High School, in Fullerton, CA (Class of &#39;05).  Over the past half-\n&gt; year or so, I have been working with my AP Computer Science teacher,\n&gt; Dave Wittry, on a project to make JUnit testing more accessible to\n&gt; both teachers and students called JAM*Tester (JUnit Auto-Matic\n&gt; Tester).\n\nHi, David. I just looked at the Student Demo, and I would like to \ncommend you and your team on a very neat project. You have done free of \ncharge part of what Parasoft has done (with JTest), charging thousands \nof dollars. (This is not a slight on Parasoft... I&#39;m just noting the \ncomparison. Obviously, Parasoft&#39;s JTest does much more than JAM*Tester \ndoes. Don&#39;t send any cards and letters.)\n\nThe technique that JAM*Tester uses is similar to the &quot;Gold Master&quot; \ntechnique, which involves observing what the code does, then pasting its \nactual behavior into a test, with the idea of verifying that the code \ncontinues to do (in the future) what it does now. It also does part of \nwhat Agitar&#39;s Agitator product does: suggest a series of tests, based on \na structural analysis of the code.\n\nSince you&#39;re obviously a bright programming student, I have a homework \nquestion for you. (My wife is a tutor, and I get to help out, so I&#39;m \nvery used to giving homework.) If you could wave a wand and add three \nfeatures to JAM*Tester, which features would you choose? Defend your \nanswer. :)\n\nCongratulations. It&#39;s very nice work.\n-- \nJ. B.
