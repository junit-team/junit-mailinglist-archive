There is no value-add\n&gt; here.  Right?  No addit=\r\nional value to customers and no additional\n&gt; value to developers.  It is si=\r\nmply style.\n&gt;\n&gt; Or, am I fundamentally missing something.\n\n\nHere is how I p=\r\nitch annotations for testing.\n\nFirst of all, putting &quot;test&quot; in front of a t=\r\nest method is really &quot;adding\nmetadata to that method&quot;.  You want to keep th=\r\ne method, but you are also\nadding information for a specific, and telling t=\r\nhis tool that this method\nhas a specific status.  Now imagine that you want=\r\n to do the same thing for,\nsay, a tool that will automatically generate RMI=\r\n stubs, and suddenly your\nmethods need to be called &quot;testRemoteFoo()&quot;.  You=\r\n can see where this leads.\n\nThe obvious place for this kind of information =\r\nis in annotations.\n\nThis &quot;older&quot; way is also very intrusive:  it forces you=\r\n to certain namings\n(methods start with &quot;test&quot;), certain structural constra=\r\nints (&quot;have to extend\na given base class&quot;, which is a big deal in Java sinc=\r\ne we only have one shot\nat that) and also imposes you to a certain package =\r\nhierarchy to keep track\nof what tests are and where (package test.db, test.=\r\ngui, etc...).\n\nOnce you embrace annotations and, in the case of TestNG, tes=\r\nt groups, you\nregain complete freedom to write your Java code the way you w=\r\nant.  In\neffect, your test classes look a lot more like simple Java code (i=\r\nf you\nremove the annotations).\n\nAdditionally, test groups (@Test(groups =3D=\r\n {&quot;db&quot;, &quot;fast&quot;}) cleanly separate\nyour test structure from your Java struct=\r\nure.  You are free to put your\nclasses in whatever package you like, and yo=\r\nu will specify their test\ncategory in these groups (additionally, test meth=\r\nods can belong to more than\none group, something you can&#39;t do if you&#39;re usi=\r\nng package to organize your\ntests).\n\n-- \nC=E9dric\n\n\n[Non-text portions of t=\r\nhis message have been removed]\n\n\n",
