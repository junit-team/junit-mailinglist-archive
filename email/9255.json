It matters when one fails.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Let&#39;s say that testB uses functions that are tested in testA.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Let&#39;s instead say that TestB collaborates with lightweight objects that <br/>\nprovide predictable results according to the behavior we expect of A.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; During development, I&#39;ll be coding testA first. When that<br/>\n&gt; passes, I&#39;ll move to testB.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; But tests take time. And as the number of tests grows, it<br/>\n&gt; takes longer and longer to get to the last test on the list.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>How long is long? How many tests? What&#39;s your test throughput 100/s? <br/>\n200/s? Less?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; So testing in reverse order speeds things up during development.<br/>\n&gt; (Or simply running the last test, rather than all of them.)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; But when running the full suite of tests, it&#39;s helpful to<br/>\n&gt; run them in the original order -- because sometimes a regression<br/>\n&gt; causes a test to fail which was passing earlier, and it&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; good to discover such violated assumptions.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; So there&#39;s a tension between wanting to speed things up<br/>\n&gt; and wanting to verify that previously valid assumptions<br/>\n&gt; still hold.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The only way I can see to satisfy both goals is to allow<br/>\n&gt; tests to run either from first to last, or from last to<br/>\n&gt; first.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Another option is to execute only the current suite while working on the <br/>\nbehavior under test, then execute the full suite when you think you have <br/>\nthe behavior under test working.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Any other ideas?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yes. Write faster tests. I usually get up to about 1500 before I start <br/>\nto notice a break in my rhythm. If I notice a break in my rhythm before <br/>\nI hit 1500 tests, then I fix the tests.<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJ. B.
