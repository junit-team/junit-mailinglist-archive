It&#39;s a paper that talks about some\n&gt; techniques for developing a database application test-first. The example\n&gt; code is in the cvs respository on sourceforge, accessible via\n&gt; http://www.mockobjects.com.\n&gt; \n&gt;  http://www.mockobjects.com/papers/jdbc_testfirst.html\n&gt; \n&gt; Comments, etc?\n&gt; \n&gt; Steve\n\nSteve,\nI have tried to write a similar chapter for the test-first book I&#39;m writing\nat the moment. What evetually made me drop the mock approach for JDBC code\nis:\n- The setup of the mocks was more and more of a nightmare. If you really\nwant to test the correct usage of JDBC, you have to check state-dependent\nbehaviour across objects. For instance, you have to check that a statement won&#39;t be\nreused if its connection has been closed, or that your statement has not\nbeen reused for another query to execute before you have read all the results;\nand so on and on.\n- The test code got too brittle for my taste. During refactoring I\nconstantly changed the way how I queried the database and handed on result sets etc.\nSo I found myself changing the test code again and again. I think your example\nis too stable to show this disadvantage.\n- Testing that the SQL is right requires some kind of SQL-Parser. It&#39;s not a\nproblem for static SQL strings but it is one when SQL code is somehow\nassembled dynamically - which was the case in the example I had chosen and which\nseemed to be natural when striving for the simples thing.\n\nThe problem might be that JDBC itself was designed without test first and\ntestability in mind. One might probably come up with an API that is much better\nsuited for testing.\n\nJohannes\r\n--========GMXBoundary34581001406337\r\nContent-Type: application/octet-stream;\tname=&quot;Developing JDBC applications test-first.url&quot;\r\n\r\n[ Attachment content not displayed ]\r\n--========GMXBoundary34581001406337--\r\n\n",
