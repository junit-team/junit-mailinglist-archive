I&#39;m retrofitting unit tests onto an existing large J2EE app.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; To me, one of the benefits of tests is that they help me to spot design<br/>\n&gt; problems early.

As to whether you can conveniently refactor, <br/>\nthat is another issue.<br/>\n<br/>\nTry garden-variety Extract Method. If a method has too many codepaths, <br/>\nextract the smallest, innermost part you could reasonably test on its <br/>\nown, make it public, then test it in isolation.
