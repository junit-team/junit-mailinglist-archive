Thanks.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; One more basic question.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; How is unit testing different from component testing.<br/>\n&gt; Let me clarify. Here the component is not something<br/>\n&gt; like COM, but a set of C functions with some exposed<br/>\n&gt; APIs. Testing includes testing these interfaces and<br/>\n&gt; functionality implemented by this component through<br/>\n&gt; these set of C functions.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>A unit test is whatever you want it to be. I am told that the IEEE <br/>\ndefinition of &quot;unit&quot; is so vague as to be useless.<br/>\n<br/>\nSince I program mainly in OO languages, I test objects. That means that <br/>\nI fix one object (class) to test, then simulate all its collaborators. I <br/>\nonly test one object at a time. If you have a group of functions that <br/>\nall operate on a common parameter, then they are /essentially/ the same <br/>\nas methods on a class, and so testing those functions by simulating <br/>\nevery other function they might invoke constitutes object testing.<br/>\n<br/>\nI occasionally test multiple objects at once. When I do, this is <br/>\nintegration testing: writing a test that exercises multiple <br/>\nproduction-quality objects collaborating with one another. If you test a <br/>\nfunction and allow it to invoke the real implementations of the other <br/>\nfunctions it uses, then I call that integration testing.<br/>\n<br/>\nI /suppose/ that if a component is an implementation of a single <br/>\ninterface, /and/ if you simulate any of the other components with which <br/>\nit collaborates, then testing that component would be equivalent to <br/>\nobject testing.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Currently the way I test these by writing some test<br/>\n&gt; stubs. If it is advantageous to move to cppunit/junit<br/>\n&gt; I would love to do so. Please note that the developer<br/>\n&gt; of these components is not me.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Since you&#39;re working in C, you might want to just start with this:<br/>\n<br/>\nTestDriver.c<br/>\n<br/>\nint main(int argc, char** argv) {<br/>\n     void* result = invokeYourFunction(parameter1, parameter2);<br/>\n     if (compare(expectedResult, result) != 0) {<br/>\n         return -1;<br/>\n     }<br/>\n<br/>\n     return 0;<br/>\n}<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is a simple test driver that tries to invoke one of your functions <br/>\nwith a set of inputs and returns a result. It then compares the result <br/>\nto the result you expect, &quot;failing&quot; if they don&#39;t match and &quot;passing&quot; if <br/>\nthey do. Write your first test in a similar way. Then another. Then <br/>\nanother. Refactor out the common bits of the test driver. After about <br/>\nten tests you&#39;ll have a fully working framework of your own to use and love.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat is, of course, if there&#39;s no good C-Unit implementation. Maybe <br/>\nthere is. Ask Google.<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJ. B.
