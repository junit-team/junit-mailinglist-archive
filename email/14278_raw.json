Unless some new assertions are available - \nAssert#assertException or Assert#assertInstanceOf, for example - I don&#39;t \nthink the introduction of a new class is justified on the basis of \naltering which Exception it uses to indicate a failed assertion.\n\nElliotte Harold wrote:\n&gt; Alexandru Popescu wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;&gt;As far as I can tell I think that the new Assert class was created to remove the custom \n&gt;&gt;AssertionException and use the AssertionException provided since JDK1.4. From my point of view this \n&gt;&gt;is definitely a very good reason to have it.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; OK. I can see that, but I think that&#39;s a very bad idea. A JUnit \n&gt; assertion test failure is not at all the same thing as a Java language \n&gt; assert failure. They are two different things and they should be \n&gt; distinguishable. Failure to do that might cause unexpected problems with \n&gt; various tools that interpret an AssertionError as meaning one thing when \n&gt; JUnit makes it mean something different.\n&gt; \n\n-- \nStephen Smith, MEng (Wales).\nhttp://www.stephen-smith.co.uk/\n\n\n\n\n",
