How would that help?<br/>\n&gt; Wouldn&#39;t that ultimately leave me with the same problem,<br/>\n&gt; only within the singleton class?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Most often, singleton classes store the singleton instance in a <br/>\nprivate static variable in the class.  So I&#39;m assuming that the <br/>\nDefaultGatewayController class contains a private static field to <br/>\nhold the reference to its own singleton instance.  My suggestion is <br/>\nthat you could use reflection to change this private static field to <br/>\npoint to instances you create.  On the other hand, maybe the <br/>\nsingleton-ness of the class isn&#39;t an issue in your tests; maybe none <br/>\nof the code under test calls static methods of <br/>\nDefaultGatewayController to get the singleton instance.<br/>\n_ _ _<br/>\n<br/>\nIt doesn&#39;t appear that you need to use a class loader.  It seems <br/>\nlike you could just do this:<br/>\n<br/>\nConstructor constructor =<br/>\nDefaultGatewayController.class.getDeclaredConstructor(paramTypes); <br/>\n<br/>\nThen the instance created by this constructor would be directly <br/>\nusable by your test code.</div>",
