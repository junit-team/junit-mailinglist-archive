This method is specific to the type of model\ngenerated by EMF.\n\nThe Use Case for using the model is for 1 POJO only,\nso breaking out the load code to separate concerns\nadds questionable value in terms of manageability.\n\nAt the end of the day, I just wanted to make sure the\nprivate method was working as an intermediate step to\ndoing a test of the public api, which is probably what\nmost people want to do when they test private methods.\n\nCheers,\n- Ole\n\n\n\n--- &quot;J.

Loading file contents into memory, usually as\n&gt; lines of text.\n&gt; 2. Parsing the lines of text while in memory.\n&gt; \n&gt; Part #1 is a perfect candidate for a reusable\n&gt; library. In Ruby, you \n&gt; simply say file.readlines(), for example. There&#39;s no\n&gt; reason to \n&gt; reimplement this the way we do in Java. (Does Java 5\n&gt; have a built-in \n&gt; library method for loading a text file yet?!)\n&gt; \n&gt; Part #2 is what&#39;s specific to your application,\n&gt; because it depends on \n&gt; how you formatted the text when you saved it. I\n&gt; could see that being a \n&gt; private method, perhaps, that takes a List of lines\n&gt; and parses them.\n&gt; \n&gt; So it might be that the only reason the &quot;loading&quot;\n&gt; feature is not \n&gt; reusable is that Java hasn&#39;t made the reusable part\n&gt; reusable!\n&gt; -- \n&gt; J.
