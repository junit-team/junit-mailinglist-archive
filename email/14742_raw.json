I think it could have been avoided by better packaging. In\nfact, as Robert already pointed out, it&#39;s easy to exclude packages from\nJavaDoc.\n\n&gt; Has it been that long since you learned a new API?\n&gt; Featuritis isn&#39;t just a problem for applications. It applies to\n&gt; libraries too. Smaller is better. Too large an API becomes a problem.\n\nIf I find a package with the name &quot;internal&quot; in it, I&#39;d never come to the\nconclusion that it is one I should look at.\n\n&gt; Trying to bring this back on topic, the JUnit 3.8 API is a good\n&gt; example. It&#39;s actually pretty small but not as small as it could or\n&gt; should be. Take a look at\n&gt; http://www.junit.org/junit/javadoc/3.8.1/index.htm How much of that\n&gt; does a programmer actually need to know?\n\nMainly the content of junit.framework. Doesn&#39;t look hard to find out to me.\n\n&gt; How easy is it for someone\n&gt; trying to learn the API to figure what they need to do and where to\n&gt; get started? Even experienced users can have trouble finding a\n&gt; relatively unfamiliar class, and that&#39;s a small API as APIs go, and\n&gt; much better documented than most.\n\nI don&#39;t remember having that problem, or having it seen mentioned on the\nmailing list often.\n\n&gt; Probably half of what&#39;s there could\n&gt; be non-public, and users would be the better off for it if it were.\n&gt; What benefit is served by making junit.samples or TestResult$1\n&gt; public?  \n\nI don&#39;t see the problem you seem to see. I never had a problem with the\nJunit API.\n\nCheers, Ilja\n\n\n",
