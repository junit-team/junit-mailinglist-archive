And IMO it can only be answered by trying it.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, please try it for a reasonable time (say, half a year) - and try<br/>\nJunit for a similiar amount of time. If you *then* report back here with<br/>\nyour experiences, you will probably find a very interested audience.<br/>\n<br/>\nUntil then, all your points are mere speculation - and not very<br/>\ninteresting ones, to actual practitioners.<br/>\n<br/>\nRegards, Ilja<br/>\n<br/>\nPS: Personally, I am not very inclined trying out Jtest - simply because<br/>\nI *like* working test-driven. YMMV.</div>",
