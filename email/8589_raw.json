He said\n&gt; *unnecessary* documentation is a top time waster.\n\nYes.  Argh.  &lt;sigh&gt;  this is one of the things that is so often\nmisunderstood and misinterpreted.  &quot;XP/Agile means no documentation..\nwoohoo!&quot;  Agile means barely sufficient documentation.  You do what is\nneeded... and just that.  That applies to pretty much everything.. not\njust docs.   What does &quot;needed&quot; mean?  Several things... like the\ncustomer valuing it enough to explicitly ask for it pay for it, like\nproviding a high level overview of the system for anyone needing to\nfind their way around, like providing enough detail for people that\nwill need to work on it later (what Alistair calls &quot;setting up for the\nnext game&quot;), like what&#39;s appropriate for the context.. an published\nAPI needs more internal docs (think javadoc) than totally internal\nfunctionallity.\n\nDave\n\n\n\n",
