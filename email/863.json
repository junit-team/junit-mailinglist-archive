    "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1510282652\">Hello,<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; When I start the TestRunner provided by Ant first the method &quot;runTest&quot;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; is executed (which is OK). But then the other methods are executed in an<br/>\n&gt;&gt; arbritrary order (I suppose). How can I change this behaviour?<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Simply rename your test methods so they don&#39;t start with *test* word, this<br/>\n&gt; will prevent them to be executed by TestRunner.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This is a possible solution I found too. IMHO this is not very useful in <br/>\nmy case, because I still like to know which tests succeeded and which didn&#39;t.<br/>\nUnfortunately this does only work if you have written &quot;testXXX&quot; methods because<br/>\nJUnit invokes these methods independantly. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Dependent actions should be written within one test case. There was<br/>\n&gt; a discussion on this mailing list few weeks ago (look for the thread [junit]<br/>\n&gt; Order of Tests).<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I found these discussions and do not agree. In my application area the <br/>\nresult is that I have several mini test case which depend heavily on<br/>\neach other. The glue between them would be a number of test cases which <br/>\nmust themselves be used in larger test suites (can I nest test suites,<br/>\nbtw?).<br/>\n<br/>\nRegards<br/>\n\tBoris Boehlen<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nDipl.-Inform.
