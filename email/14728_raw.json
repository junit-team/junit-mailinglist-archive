I don&#39;t see how having an additional\n&gt; org.something.util.CalendarParser class could make any library harder to\n&gt; understand and use. Hell, that class could even be extracted to a different\n&gt; binary, so that an outside developer wouldn&#39;t see it at all.\n\nHave you really never tried to work your way through a mess of JavaDoc \nwith no easy way to figure out what classes you needed and what you \ncould ignore? Has it been that long since you learned a new API? \nFeaturitis isn&#39;t just a problem for applications. It applies to \nlibraries too. Smaller is better. Too large an API becomes a problem.\n\nTrying to bring this back on topic, the JUnit 3.8 API is a good example. \nIt&#39;s actually pretty small but not as small as it could or should be. \nTake a look at http://www.junit.org/junit/javadoc/3.8.1/index.htm How \nmuch of that does a programmer actually need to know? How easy is it for \nsomeone trying to learn the API to figure what they need to do and where \nto get started? Even experienced users can have trouble finding a \nrelatively unfamiliar class, and that&#39;s a small API as APIs go, and much \nbetter documented than most. Probably half of what&#39;s there could be \nnon-public, and users would be the better off for it if it were. What \nbenefit is served by making junit.samples or TestResult$1 public?\n\n-- \n﻿Elliotte Rusty Harold  elharo@...\nXML in a Nutshell 3rd Edition Just Published!\nhttp://www.cafeconleche.org/books/xian3/\nhttp://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0596007647/cafeaulaitA/ref=nosim\n\n",
