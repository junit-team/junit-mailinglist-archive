Or refactoring invalid tests would take more time than\nI felt I =\r\ngained from the TDD process.\n\nTDD for me is a thinking tool, it helps me so=\r\nlve problems\nincrementally and I often end up with simpler solutions than I=\r\n first\nthought I would. Of course sometimes I arrive just where I thought I=\r\n\nwould with the complexity I thought I would have but I seldomly know\nthat =\r\nin advance.\n\nI agree with you that one should always question what one is d=\r\noing and\nlook for improvement in any situation.\n\n/J\n\n&gt;  Here is a scenario =\r\nI&#39;ve seen happen fairly often:\n&gt;\n&gt;  Write test1\n&gt;  Write code1\n&gt;  Write tes=\r\nt2\n&gt;  Write code2\n&gt;\n&gt;  Then a refactoring comes to mind and you realize you=\r\n don&#39;t need code1\n&gt;  and code2 any more, so you write code3, and suddenly, =\r\nyou find\n&gt;  yourself having to refactor (or throw away) both test1 and test=\r\n2.\n&gt;\n&gt;  I was simply suggesting that sometimes, the following flow works be=\r\ntter:\n&gt;\n&gt;  Write code1\n&gt;  Write code2\n&gt;  &lt;realize a refactoring is possible=\r\n&gt;\n&gt;  Refactor code1/code2 into code3\n&gt;  &lt;happy with the result, now we writ=\r\ne the test&gt;\n&gt;  Write test3\n&gt;\n&gt;  Net result:  two less tests to write.\n&gt;\n\n",
