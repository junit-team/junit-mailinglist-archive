We are not verifying Count<br/>\nin this test, but rather indexing.  Although I would argue that it is<br/>\nnice to have pre-requisites satisfied in the middle of a test, to help<br/>\ndirect your attention to the true cause of the issue.<br/>\n<br/>\nMuch like the snowball effect of the nuclear reactor plant example.  A<br/>\ndefect occurs, which in turn causes other defects (which in turn<br/>\ncauses more defects, and so on).  From an analysis perspective it is<br/>\ndifficult to pin-point the root defect because it is being masks but<br/>\nsubsequent ones.  Unlike the above example, where the order of the<br/>\ndefects can be used to unravel the issue, in testing order is<br/>\nindependent, so the primary defects are not necessarily those that<br/>\noccur first.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo address this, it would interesting to append two additional bits of<br/>\ninformation on an assertion.<br/>\n<br/>\n1) Assumption.AreEqual(3,list.Count,&quot;Check the count, and the add methods&quot;);<br/>\n2) Corollory.IsTrue(list.ContainsOnly(typeof(string)));<br/>\n<br/>\nAn assumption is really a pre-requisite - that if fails, really means<br/>\nthat you were not even able to set-up to do the real testing.  Having<br/>\nassumptions fail helps to pin-point coupling between components - as<br/>\nwell as helps direct your attention was secondary failing tests to the<br/>\nprimary ones (aka the failed Assertions).<br/>\n<br/>\nAn corollary is something you believe to be true, but is not essential<br/>\nto your unit test itself.  Corollaries are nice because you indirectly<br/>\nadd additional tests for other components of our system without that<br/>\nmuch extra overhead.  Failing corollaries may highlight obscure bugs<br/>\nin other parts of your system, or they highlight your<br/>\nmis-understanding of those other parts (or they highlight a change to<br/>\nthe underlying assumptions of those parts).<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOn Thu, 8 Jul 2004 10:22:01 +0000, Jason Rogers<br/>\n&lt;jacaetevha@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; On Wednesday 07 July 2004 10:49 pm, Curt Sampson wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  On Tue, 6 Jul 2004, hedgi wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  &gt;   Now I there is the problem.

Let&#39;s face it; a lot of groups of tests do have<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  known dependencies between tests such that if test A fails, we know<br/>\n </span></blockquote>that<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;  the output of tests B, C and D are uninteresting.
