A C++ developer pair her=\r\ne reported that  \ntheir first unit test took them about 10 hours to write. =\r\nThe second  \none took them two hours. The third test, maybe 15 minutes. (Th=\r\nese were  \nafter-the-fact unit tests against legacy code, so I don&#39;t have t=\r\nhe  \ndevelopment times to compare against.)\n\nIn order to get this effective=\r\nness, as C=E9dric suggests, you have to be  \nwilling to refactor the tests =\r\nso as to eliminate duplication between  \nthem and keep them clear. Most of =\r\nmy unit tests are very short and  \nvery readable, which helps keep comprehe=\r\nnsion times down.\n\nI&#39;ve also found that writing tests first generally keeps=\r\n me out of the  \nproblem of writing code that&#39;s hard to test. Until you sta=\r\nrt writing  \nlots of tests, and realizing what&#39;s hard to test, test-after t=\r\nends to  \nproduce a design with unfortunate dependencies (that you have to =\r\nbreak  \nin order to write effective tests).\n\nJeff\n\nQuoting C=E9dric Beust ?=\r\n &lt;cbeust@...&gt;:\n&gt; In my experience, this is a bit hard to quantify, b=\r\nut it&#92;&#39;s probably fair to\n&gt; say that while the cost appears a bit on the hi=\r\ngh side initially (especially\n&gt; if the developers on your team are not used=\r\n to writing tests and that there\n&gt; is no existing testing infrastructure), =\r\nit tends to decrease over time as\n&gt; programmers become more experienced in =\r\nwriting tests, reuse or create test\n&gt; base classes and tend to write solid =\r\ntests in their first iteration.\n&gt;\n&gt; Although it&#92;&#39;s obviously hard to prove =\r\nor disprove, I would probably say that\n&gt; at the very beginning, it&#92;&#39;s not r=\r\nare to spend as much time writing a test as\n&gt; it is to implement the corres=\r\nponding feature. That first test is always\n&gt; very expensive, especially if =\r\nit&#92;&#39;s an area of your product that has no tests\n&gt; at all. It all gets bette=\r\nr after that.\n&gt;\n&gt; Hope it helps, and looking forward to other people&#92;&#39;s ans=\r\nwers.\n&gt;\n&gt; --\n&gt; C=E9dric\n&gt; http://testng.org\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; On 2/16/07, felix3142 &lt;f.=\r\nnoz@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt; we&#92;&#39;re going to establish unit-testing (basical=\r\nly for web applications)\n&gt;&gt; in our company. Because we don&#92;&#39;t want to chang=\r\ne the whole programming\n&gt;&gt; paradigm to XP we rather want to use a test-last=\r\n method in the\n&gt;&gt; beginning and then watch out for further steps.\n&gt;&gt; I&#92;&#39;m n=\r\now in the process of investigating the basic requirements and\n&gt;&gt; conditions=\r\n.\n&gt;&gt; One question that occured is if it&#92;&#39;s possible to quantify the amount\n=\r\n&gt;&gt; of extra time you need when using unit testing compared to the\n&gt;&gt; non-te=\r\nsting approach. I solely refer to the writing of unit tests.\n&gt;&gt; Later savin=\r\ng of time (by better code) shouldn&#92;&#39;t be considered. So\n&gt;&gt; what&#92;&#39;s your exp=\r\nerience? Can anybody do a statement about time\n&gt;&gt; consumption of writing un=\r\nit tests?\n\n\nPowered by Horde\n\n",
