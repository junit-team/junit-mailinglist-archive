Maybe you<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; think you are productive with your current text editor (emacs, vi,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; TextEdit,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; etc...) but I guarantee that your productivity will shoot up with an<br/>\n&gt; &gt; IDE.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I wasn&#39;t trying to infer that anyone should completely avoid using an<br/>\n&gt; &gt; IDE for development. I was stating that it is not necessary to use an<br/>\n&gt; &gt; IDE to run a test suite.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Understood.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Further, I recommend not using an IDE for running test suites.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Why not?  You get just as much feedback but on top of that, the IDE will<br/>\n&gt; take you to failing tests with one press of a key so you can start<br/>\n&gt; investigating right away...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; What do you gain by running the tests from the command line?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Again, I speak of the full unit test suite being run outside of the<br/>\nIDE. When developing within an IDE by all means use the IDE&#39;s unit<br/>\ntest facilities for the classes being worked on at that point.<br/>\n<br/>\nAn example perhaps. When developing in, gasp, Eclipse, I will create<br/>\nboth an object and it&#39;s test simultaneously. I will run the test using<br/>\nEclipse&#39;s JUnit GUI test runner. So, at the object (and it&#39;s test)<br/>\nlevel, I actually do think you should run the tests inside the IDE.<br/>\n(Again, this assumes you are an IDE user. Most of the time I am not.)<br/>\nBut, once you are testing at the project level, running suites of<br/>\ntests, I strongly recommend being outside the IDE. My reasons for this<br/>\nare many; but the big hitters are that it enables you to run the full<br/>\ntest suite away from the developers and thus avoid disturbing them, it<br/>\navoids any dependencies upon libraries on the developers machines and<br/>\nit enables you to run the builds and tests on a nice big and fast Unix<br/>\nmachine that your IDE of choice may not be available for. We are in<br/>\nthe process of bringing in CruiseControl and will be running it on a<br/>\nSolaris box. Our corporate IDE (name withheld to protect the lame)<br/>\nwill not run on Solaris, but CC and Ant and JUnit will.<br/>\n<br/>\nEasy huh?<br/>\n<br/>\nSimon<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nwww.simonpeter.com<br/>\nuab.blogspot.com</div>",
