Do you think it would be a<br/>\n&gt; desirable<br/>\n&gt; design decision to refactor your class(es) to reflect the first method of<br/>\n&gt; testing?  That is have a base class that handles TCP/IP traffic requests<br/>\n&gt; and<br/>\n&gt; then two decendents (one that tunnels through SSL and one that doesn&#39;t).<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It depends on what you are doing in the code. If you can replace a<br/>\nconditional expression by introducing subclasses go ahead. If the difference in the<br/>\ntwo classes is nothing but a constant value which is handed over to another<br/>\nserver object stick to the one-class-design. At least that&#39;s what I usually do.<br/>\n<br/>\nJohannes</div>",
