With that\nthe Operation could be generated.\n\nThen test cases could be generated that complement and\nprove that the method body generated based on the OCL\nstring is correct, giving the developer further\nconfidence in the solution.\n\nJust an idea.\n\nCheers,\n- Ole\n\n\n--- bohs01@... wrote:\n\n&gt; Yeap it aint what I had in mind, in fact i dont\n&gt; think i can come up  \n&gt; with something like it LoL\n&gt; \n&gt; What i had in mind was just some sort of template\n&gt; for a user to fill  \n&gt; in the blanks sortof\n&gt; \n&gt; and a tutorial which asks questions whose answers\n&gt; are used to fill in  \n&gt; the  above mentioned blanks\n&gt; \n&gt; Thus, in a way i think it helps with TDD, since it\n&gt; drives the design  \n&gt; process but asking questions like what are the pre\n&gt; and post  \n&gt; conditions, class invariants etc, that the user\n&gt; needs to answer in  \n&gt; order to generate the test cases.\n&gt; \n&gt; It also automates the generation of the test cases,\n&gt; &quot;generating of the  \n&gt; source code&quot; that is.\n&gt; \n&gt; yeap actually i&#39;ve been reading the posts, and am\n&gt; not sure what PMD  \n&gt; does exactly...\n&gt; \n&gt; Jimm\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Quoting Ole Ersoy &lt;ole_ersoy@...&gt;:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Wow - Dud - You Da Man!!\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; (And judging by the name - quite possibly\n&gt; Norwegian, which explains why\n&gt; &gt; u so da Man :-)  )\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; This actually looks a lot like\n&gt; &gt; what I&#39;ve been trying to describe,\n&gt; &gt; with the possible exception that I don&#39;t think\n&gt; &gt; it generates tests like Jimm wants to do,\n&gt; &gt; but hey this is real ;-).  HooohHahhh!\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Jimm in order for this to work the way it says it\n&gt; &gt; works it has to parse source and store it in some\n&gt; &gt; model.  Then analyze it...looks like using rule\n&gt; sets.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m sure you could use the same model and rule\n&gt; sets\n&gt; &gt; to generate tests (Just shooting from the hip. \n&gt; I&#39;d have to look at it a\n&gt; &gt; little more\n&gt; &gt; to see whether I could come up with a concrete\n&gt; example. )\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; http://pmd.sourceforge.net/\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Thanks for letting me us Joakim.  Can&#39;t wait to\n&gt; &gt; to hook it up to my maven projects.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Cheers,\n&gt; &gt; - Ole\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Joakim Ohlrogge wrote:\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; As a matter of fact...it would be nice to have\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; something that enumerates the branches and\n&gt; generates a\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; report on which methods has a number of\n&gt; branches over\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; a certain limit...for code refactoring and\n&gt; maintenance\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; purposes.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Hi Ole,\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; I have not read the whole thread yet so if this\n&gt; has already been\n&gt; &gt;&gt; suggested I&#39;m sorry.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; PMD actually reports methods with a cyclomatic\n&gt; complexity that is\n&gt; &gt;&gt; larger than 10. If I&#39;m not mistaken that is what\n&gt; you&#39;re looking for.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; I find this helpful to find targets to refactor\n&gt; in legacy code. When\n&gt; &gt;&gt; TDD:ing the PLP (my abbreviation for path of\n&gt; least pain) keeps the\n&gt; &gt;&gt; cyclomatic complexity down (Like Jeff Langr\n&gt; suggested earlier in the\n&gt; &gt;&gt; threat).\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Cheers!\n&gt; &gt;&gt; /J\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nTired of spam?
