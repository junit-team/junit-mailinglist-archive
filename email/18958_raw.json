I&#39;ve thought in the past that I&#39;d\nlike at least three different organizational schemes for my tests:\n\n1) By class tested\n2) By functionality tested\n3) By order of creation*\n\nYou bring out possibly yet another:\n\n4) By intent\n\nPerhaps 3 and 4 are similar.  I&#39;ve thought in the past it should be\npossible to do all of this by thinking hard about how I lay out my\ntests, but I now think that, at least, 3 and 4 lead to a different\norganization than 1 and 2.  Do you think that JUnit could help with\nthis, or would the first step be in an IDE?\n\n   David Saff\n\n* I&#39;m always reminded of a scene from High Fidelity in which John\nCusack&#39;s character re-sorts his record collection in &quot;autobiographical\norder&quot;--that is, the order in which he bought them.\n\n",
