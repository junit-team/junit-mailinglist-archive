You are absolutely right that if=\r\n we had frequent releases the optimal strategy would be to conceal everythi=\r\nng possible in the framework and open it up &quot;on demand&quot;. I don&#39;t see how to=\r\n implement frequent releases with JUnit, however, since the IDE vendors bak=\r\ne JUnit into their offerings and we don&#39;t have any infrastructure to push u=\r\npdates. Perhaps I am just fussing about this, or there is a simple solution=\r\n. I am open to suggestions.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nKent Beck\nThree Rivers Insti=\r\ntute\n\n&gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; From: junit@yahoogroups.com [mailto:ju=\r\nnit@yahoogroups.com] On \n&gt; Behalf Of Elliotte Rusty Harold\n&gt; Sent: Wednesda=\r\ny, November 02, 2005 7:14 AM\n&gt; To: junit@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Subject: Re: [ju=\r\nnit] JUnit 4 restructuring\n&gt; \n&gt; Kent Beck wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; However, as Erich i=\r\ns at pains to explain to me frequently, \n&gt; that is not the context in which=\r\n we are writing JUnit. We \n&gt; need to balance the need for flexibility of ex=\r\ntension with \n&gt; the need for flexibility of design evolution. Revealing all=\r\n \n&gt; the details of our implementation means we can&#39;t change \n&gt; anything. An=\r\nd so we are left, as you said, revealing only as \n&gt; much as we are certain =\r\nwill be useful.\n&gt; \n&gt; I basically agree with that. Protected methods are fin=\r\ne, as long as \n&gt; you&#39;re reasonably confident they&#39;re right and you&#39;re willi=\r\nng \n&gt; to maintain \n&gt; them in the future.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; This leaves me unsettled. I=\r\n know that my frameworks aren&#39;t \n&gt; as useful as they could be, but I also k=\r\nnow that I would \n&gt; regret opening them up completely. I don&#39;t see how to s=\r\ntrike \n&gt; a better balance than we strike with JUnit, though, so I&#39;ll \n&gt; liv=\r\ne with it.\n&gt; \n&gt; I think extreme programming/agile development offers a path=\r\n \n&gt; out of this \n&gt; conundrum. Instead of looking for one big bang release t=\r\nhat \n&gt; then stands \n&gt; untouched for a few years, look to more incremental r=\r\neleases (like in \n&gt; the earlier days of JUnit). Two week release cycles giv=\r\ne you \n&gt; plenty of \n&gt; opportunities to open up the framework to extension a=\r\ns people \n&gt; actually \n&gt; need and request the extension. I&#39;ve found by exper=\r\nience that \n&gt; I tend to \n&gt; be very bad at predicting what actually will be =\r\nneeded, even \n&gt; by myself. \n&gt; Therefore the longer I can delay the decision=\r\n, the more likely it is \n&gt; that the eventual decision will be correct.\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n Of course, at least half of this is stuff I learned first from your \n&gt; boo=\r\nk. :-)\n&gt; \n&gt; -- \n&gt; =EF=BB=BFElliotte Rusty Harold  elharo@...\n&gt; =\r\nXML in a Nutshell 3rd Edition Just Published!\n&gt; http://www.cafeconleche.org=\r\n/books/xian3/\n&gt; http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=3D0596007647/cafeaul=\r\naitA/\n&gt; ref=3Dnosim\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ------------------------ Yahoo!
