    "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-19503674\"><blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">&gt; None of which prevents somebody from writing their own implementation<br/>\n&gt; of the interface, instantiating it and bypassing the factories<br/>\n&gt; completely. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>True. What would someone motivate to do so?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; The source (or byte) code can always be forked. At that point it&#39;s out<br/>\n&gt; of my hands, and not really my responsibility.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Agreed. And I think the same is true when someone provides his own<br/>\nimplementation of an interface. He had to do so deliberately, so it&#39;s his<br/>\nresponsibility to make it work.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; But they can&#39;t just<br/>\n&gt; swap out my class for a different one, if I&#39;ve written the<br/>\n&gt; implementation to depend on classes rather than interfaces. That&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; pretty much the point. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Exactly. And to me that&#39;s a *disadvantage*, because it makes the system less<br/>\nflexible and reusable.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; Thirdly, interfaces define contracts. Implementations which do not<br/>\n&gt;&gt; conform to the contracts aren&#39;t socially responsible - you shouldn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt;&gt; build them that way. How do you make sure you build them right?<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Testing, peer reviews, and well-defined types.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; All good ideas, but if this were sufficient we never would have needed<br/>\n&gt; access protection in the first place.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>What makes you think we *needed* it?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; However one<br/>\n&gt; thing they all have in common is that they&#39;re using my code because<br/>\n&gt; they implicitly or explicitly trust me and my library(s). I promise<br/>\n&gt; that the library behaves in a certain way under certain conditions and<br/>\n&gt; accomplishes certain tasks. I can do this only because my libraries<br/>\n&gt; are designed around concrete classes.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t think the last sentence is true. For example &quot;under certain<br/>\nconditions&quot; could include &quot;for implementations that conform to the contracts<br/>\nas defined in the interface&#39;s javadocs.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; If someone replaces the BAR<br/>\n&gt; class with a misbehaving version, then not just BAR but also FOO and<br/>\n&gt; everything else that depends on it could be compromised.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Again, I think of this as a feature: by replacing the Bar class with a<br/>\nversion behaving differently, I can customize the behaviour of the whole<br/>\nsystem.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust think about the Comparator interface. Of course I can implement a<br/>\nComparator that doesn&#39;t conform to the Comparator contract (for example one<br/>\nthat isn&#39;t symmetric), but that is *my* responsibility, not Sun&#39;s. (Sun&#39;s<br/>\nresponsibility is to communicate the contract, of course.)<br/>\n<br/>\nMy 0.02...<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers, Ilja</div>",
