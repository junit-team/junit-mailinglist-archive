Yes, this is also something I wanted to fix because what I =\r\nwas\nusually doing to ignore a test in JUnit is to rename it &quot;_test&quot; or comm=\r\nent\nit out.  I thought it was a bit silly and it made me realize that a tes=\r\nting\nframework should have two models:\n\n- A static model, which represents =\r\nthe business logic of your tests (the\ncode)\n- A dynamic model, which descri=\r\nbes which test to run at a given time\n\nI saw no reason why a modification t=\r\no the dynamic model (&quot;now I want to run\na different set of tests&quot;) should f=\r\norce me to change the static model (in\nJUnit, you will usually comment out =\r\nor rename a few test methods, or modify\nyour suite() method).\n\nI actually  =\r\nthought this was dangerous because you will comment out tests\nthat you migh=\r\nt forget about later.\n\nThis is one of the reasons why I introduced the noti=\r\non of &quot;groups&quot;, which\ncontain test methods.  Once you have defined them, yo=\r\nu can specify which\ngroups to run dynamically (on the command line, in the =\r\nIDE or in an XML\nfile).  You can also use annotations to specify that a cer=\r\ntain test is\ndisabled, or create a certain group &quot;disabled&quot; or &quot;broken&quot; whi=\r\nch will always\nbe ignored.  And if one day you want a list of all the tests=\r\n currently\nignored, this information is available in the reports generated =\r\nby TestNG.\n\n&gt; Now to your test dependancies. I&#39;ll tell you how our tests \n&gt;=\r\n are grouped in the suites.\n&gt; \n&gt; There is a JUnit test suite for every Ecli=\r\npse project.\n&gt; Then we have a suite for each component in the projects. The=\r\n \n&gt; components can have these groups of\n&gt; tests: persistance tests (whether=\r\n entites are persisted and \n&gt; retrieved correctly according to meta data, i=\r\nncluding \n&gt; validation rule testing for these entities and entity \n&gt; factor=\r\nies), batch program tests (which either can be legacy \n&gt; data migration bat=\r\nch tests or fast lane reader batch tests), \n&gt; business logic tests (like AB=\r\nC analysis, sales forecast, \n&gt; purchase proposals and so on), tests for uti=\r\nlity classes and \n&gt; some other groups of tests (but we have no automated GU=\r\nI tests).\n&gt; \n&gt; If persistance tests fail, then it would be no use to run al=\r\nl \n&gt; other tests. If tests for utility classes fail, then in many \n&gt; cases =\r\nit is no use to run all other tests. If batch tests \n&gt; fail, it doesn&#39;t mea=\r\nn that business logic tests will fail and \n&gt; vice versa. This is a corse gr=\r\nained dependency of our tests. \n&gt; The fine grained test dependencies are mu=\r\nch more of course.\n\nI believe this is a textbook example where TestNG would=\r\n help you greatly\n(and I&#39;d be curious to hear how you pulled it off with JU=\r\nnit).\n\nAs I said earlier, TestNG groups allow you to corelate test methods =\r\ntogether\nin a looser way than with packages and classes.  Test methods can =\r\nalso\nbelong to several groups at the same time:\n\n@Test(groups =3D { &quot;functi=\r\nonal&quot;, &quot;database&quot;, &quot;table.account&quot; })\npublic void insertIntoAccount() { ...=\r\n }\n\nThis annotation flags this test as \n\n- Part of the functional (or accep=\r\ntance) suite, which means it will be part\nof the nightly tests that exercis=\r\ne your entire application\n\n- It&#39;s also part of the database group, which me=\r\nans it does something with\nthe database.  If you make a modification to you=\r\nr front-end code, you\nprobably don&#39;t need to run it\n\n- More specifically, i=\r\nt states that it modifies the table ACCOUNT.  This\nway, if you make a modif=\r\nication to this table&#39;s schema, you can run only\nthese tests that touch thi=\r\ns table.\n\nAnd as I mentioned above, groups are also used to calculate depen=\r\ndencies and\nguarantee that groups of methods (&quot;launch-server&quot;) are always r=\r\nun and\nsucceed before a next group of tests is run (&quot;servlet&quot;).\n\nPlease ema=\r\nil me privately if you want to discuss this further as I don&#39;t\nwant to over=\r\nwhelm this list with non-JUnit material.\n \n&gt; In our team we all know that i=\r\nf persistance tests fail, we \n&gt; don&#39;t have to care about the business logic=\r\n test results.\n\nThat&#39;s one thing that bothers me about the absence of depen=\r\ndency support:\nhumans shouldn&#39;t have to figure this out, the testing framew=\r\nork should tell\nthem right away.\n\nWith JUnit, I noticed that people who rea=\r\nd the test reports every morning no\nlonger really trust what they read:  wh=\r\nen they see &quot;50 FAILURES&quot;, they\nalready know deep inside that there&#39;s proba=\r\nbly much less &quot;real&quot; failures and\nthat the other ones are just cascading fa=\r\nilures.  So they go to the logs and\ntry to figure out manually what &quot;really=\r\n&quot; happened.\n\nDependent test methods allow the test framework to be much mor=\r\ne accurate in\nits report and to say &quot;20 SUCCESSES, 1 FAILURE, 29 SKIPS&quot;.  W=\r\nhen you read\nthis, you know right away where to look.\n \n&gt; We really have a =\r\nlarge project. If the tests reflect the code \n&gt; structure too close, then r=\r\nefactoring becomes very time \n&gt; consuming because it affects tests very muc=\r\nh. Thats for \n&gt; example why it is recommended to only test public methods. =\r\n\n\nI agree that it&#39;s a good practice in general, as long as you don&#39;t make i=\r\nt a\nholistic rule to &quot;never test private methods&quot;.  It&#39;s sometimes necessar=\r\ny, as\nit is sometimes necessary to add hooks in your code just to facilitat=\r\ne your\ntests.\n\n&gt; My theoretical objection to maintain dependency informatio=\r\nn in \n&gt; the tests is that it is additional work to do and to \n&gt; maintain. I=\r\nf the dependency changes for the worse, the test \n&gt; dependency information =\r\n(annotation) need to be changed. \n\nAgreed, that&#39;s a concern.  You need to u=\r\nse your judgment when you establish\nyour test dependency graph and you shou=\r\nld probably be conservative when\ndoing so.\n\nI think coarse-grained dependen=\r\ncies make sense (&quot;only test the server if\nyou&#39;re sure it was launched succe=\r\nssfully&quot;) but finer-grained ones should be\nlooked at carefully.\n\n&gt; Besides =\r\nthis, if test group B is no longer dependent of test \n&gt; group A, then the t=\r\nests pass although there is no dependency \n&gt; anymore. It is pure luck for a=\r\n programmer to detect that test \n&gt; B is no longer dependent of test A. Only=\r\n if a new dependency \n&gt; is created, the tests will fail. But if a dependenc=\r\ny \n&gt; vanishes, the tests will not fail and will contain misleading \n&gt; depen=\r\ndency annotations. Isolated tests are more stable to \n&gt; change than depende=\r\nnt tests I think.\n\nThere is certainy value in isolated tests and despite my=\r\n strong support for\ndependent test methods, I am pretty sure that most test=\r\ns out there do not\nneed dependency and are running fine in isolation.\n\nHavi=\r\nng said that, when you need dependency...  well, you really need it.\n \n&gt; Do=\r\nn&#39;t get me wrong. I argued here against JUnit in favor of \n&gt; Design by Cont=\r\nract a few years ago. Now I like JUnit, which \n&gt; can apply to TestNG too, o=\r\nr not, who knows.\n\nNo worries, it&#39;s a very interesting conversation.  I hop=\r\ne more people will\nweigh in.\n\n-- \nC=E9dric\nhttp://beust.com/testng\n\n\n\n",
