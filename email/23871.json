However, when I tried it<br/>\n&gt; with a new test class yesterday JUnit didn&#39;t behave in the expected way.<br/>\n&gt; This is in RAD 8.0.4 using JUnit 4.8.1.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The assertEquals in the second test method is reported as a failure even<br/>\n&gt; though the method being tested returned the correct results (I traced<br/>\n&gt; through with debug to verify). JUnit appended the result from the first<br/>\n&gt; test method to the result from the second test method and reported the<br/>\n&gt; second method as a failure because the combined result didn&#39;t match the<br/>\n&gt; expected result.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Am I using the parameterized test incorrectly by having multiple test<br/>\n&gt; methods or is there a bug in JUnit?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",
