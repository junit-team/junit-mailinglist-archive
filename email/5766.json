In this case, it would be nice to<br/>\nuse something like JTest to discover all the RuntimeExceptions my<br/>\npublic API might throw.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf, however, we deal with code deep within our library that the outside<br/>\nworld doesn&#39;t use directly, and if we can be reasonably sure that, for<br/>\nexample, Class A never passes a null reference to Class B, then it<br/>\nwould likely be overkill to worry about what happens when Class B<br/>\nreceives a null reference. As Ron Jeffries would say, if you&#39;re the<br/>\nonly client, then simply don&#39;t pass null! (Loose paraphrase, there.)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;Here is another way of putting it:<br/>\n&gt;&gt;Personally I think that the &#39;exposure&#39; of (mainly) NullPointers by<br/>\n&gt;&gt;applying generated tests that put nonsense parameter values in<br/>\n </span></blockquote>methods<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;does improve the quality of the product.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Agreed. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Well, it can identify issues, but I&#39;m not sure that it improves<br/>\nquality, since it may lead to a morass of duplication of the form<br/>\n<br/>\n    if (blah == null) {<br/>\n        throw new IllegalArgumentException(&quot;Blah was null.&quot;);<br/>\n    }<br/>\n<br/>\nThat hurts the internal quality of the product.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;The motto &#39;Garbage in Garbage out&#39; still applies in this case.
