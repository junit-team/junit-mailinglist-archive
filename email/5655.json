Each class has one or more  testcase <br/>\nassociated with it. All these testecases are are added to a test suite <br/>\nsuch that each package contains one testsuite... At the topmost level i <br/>\nwill be having a mastertestsuite running which would result in testing all <br/>\nthe units... How can i write setUps for one time operations within each <br/>\ntestcase.... For example while testing session beans i want the lookup for <br/>\nEJBHome to be done only once within a testcase.. How is this possible ??<br/>\n<br/>\nRegards<br/>\nDeepStepTom<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",
