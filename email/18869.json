My coverage confirms that my ordering<br/>\n&gt; &gt; logic is run during the tests.  In this situation, the ordering<br/>\n&gt; &gt; logic is private and not directly tested.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; A user reports that the list is not sorted correctly, and now I <br/>\n&gt; &gt; find myself with at least two possible locations to <br/>\n&gt; &gt; investigate:  the HTML generation and the sorting logic.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; If I had written a test for the private sorting logic, I would <br/>\n&gt; &gt; know right away where the bug is.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Very well put.  I believe this would be a great canonical example<br/>\n&gt; of why peeking into private methods is not only OK, but the <br/>\n&gt; preferred way to test, in some cases.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Why wouldn&#39;t this be an indication that there were insufficient <br/>\ntests? Evidently, the functional test that was supposed to make sure <br/>\nthat the HTML is &quot;correct&quot; didn&#39;t actually verify that the elements <br/>\n(whatever they are) were presented in the correct order. I&#39;m not <br/>\nsure I understand what &quot;private&quot; means in this scenario. It doesn&#39;t <br/>\nusually mean &quot;can&#39;t directly access from a web browser URL&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nJim</div>",
