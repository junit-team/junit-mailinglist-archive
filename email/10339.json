Each<br/>\nsuite should contain all tests of its package and all suites of the<br/>\ndirect subpackages. Furthermore it should be able to update the<br/>\nrelevant suites, if anywhere a new test was added.<br/>\n<br/>\nI seek for such a tool, because i am going to intigrate TestCases one<br/>\nby one to an existing large project. For now only a few tests exist,<br/>\nbut they are spread over all the packages. To be able to execute these<br/>\ntests i want a root-suite which contains all existing tests. But i<br/>\ndon´t want to write suites for each package by hand. <br/>\n<br/>\nThanks in advance,<br/>\n<br/>\nHelge</div>",
