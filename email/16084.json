Keep it simple at the begining,<br/>\nrefactor it when it has some &quot;smell&quot;. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I like this approach, although I must say that I never used<br/>\n </span></blockquote>StrutsTestCase.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>If you will use Struts, what testing tool you may use to test Action<br/>\nrelated stuff ?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Here&#39;s how to know it&#39;s business logic: &quot;Would I do this even if I <br/>\n&gt; didn&#39;t have a computer?&quot; That&#39;s business logic.

Which is your first language?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>My native language is Chinese. <br/>\n<br/>\nBy the way, the junit related books, like &quot;Junit In Action&quot; and<br/>\n&quot;Pragmatic Unit Testing In Java With Junit&quot;, are already available in<br/>\nChina market. Do you have plan to introduce your book to China ? I saw<br/>\nsome messages on some BBS where Chinese java programmers gather,<br/>\nsaying your book is &quot;the most practical junit book ever seen&quot;. I guess<br/>\ntranslating your book into Chinese would benefit the whole java<br/>\ncommunity in China. :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers,<br/>\n- Frank<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; </span></blockquote></div>",
