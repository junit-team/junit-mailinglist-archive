It also&nbsp;exposes the ids for all rows that&nbsp;are inserted into the database for use in my test cases. My test classes extend TestCase and call this&nbsp;code in the setUp() and tearDown() methods before and after&nbsp;each test is run.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>My question is on how to test code that inserts into the database. I am concerned about inserting data into the database that may later interfere with my tests that read from the database so I want to make sure that all data is removed from the database after the insert methods are tested. Should this code be in the test method? Also, what is the best way to verify that everything was inserted correctly?</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Thanks for any responses.</div></div></div></div><br clear=\"all\"><hr>Get your FREE download of MSN Explorer at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href='http://go.msn.com/bql/hmtag_itl_EN.asp'>http://explorer.msn.com</a><br></html></div>",
