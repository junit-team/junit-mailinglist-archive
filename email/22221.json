There is no way to define an order, because in my experience independent tests are much more valuable than order-dependent tests.<br/>\n<br/>\nEvery time I&#39;ve had order dependencies I have had a problem with the design of the underlying system. Investing my available time in improving the design has had a much higher payoff than investing that same time into shuffling tests around.<br/>\n<br/>\nIndependent tests enable interesting transformations like parallel execution or the kind of dynamic reordering that let JUnit Max deliver failures more quickly.<br/>\n<br/>\nRegards,<br/>\n<br/>\nKent<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Dec 21, 2009, at 10:28 PM, yogesh.patil wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I have a scenario to test where in I need to make sure that tests are<br/>\n&gt; executed in particular order...<br/>\n&gt; How can I achieve this?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Are the test cases added with annotation @Test gets executed in the order<br/>\n&gt; they are written?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Do test cases get executed randomly or do they follow any specific order?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -----<br/>\n&gt; --<br/>\n&gt; Regards,<br/>\n&gt; Yogesh Patil.<br/>\n&gt; -- <br/>\n&gt; View this message in context: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://old.nabble.com/Order-of-execution-for-tests-tp26877097p26877097.html\">http://old.nabble.com/Order-of-execution-for-tests-tp26877097p26877097.html</a><br/>\n&gt; Sent from the JUnit - User mailing list archive at Nabble.com.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed] </span></blockquote></div>",
