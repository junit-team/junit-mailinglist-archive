You might even recognize some of the text and arguments as<br/>\n*near* plagiarism of some of the posts that have been made here.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn one case, in a tenet about what constitutes a unit test, I plucked<br/>\n(no pun intended) a few sentences from Michael Feathers because I<br/>\ncould not possibly improve on them, but I gave him credit (albeit a<br/>\nbit disguised).<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can find a fun, exotic, and &quot;antiqued&quot; looking PDF copy of &quot;The<br/>\nWay of Testivus&quot; - complete with a background story on its mysterious<br/>\norigins - at the following link:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.agitar.com/downloads/TheWayOfTestivus.pdf\">http://www.agitar.com/downloads/TheWayOfTestivus.pdf</a><br/>\n<br/>\nYou can also read the basic tenets of Testivus on Wikpedia, but it&#39;s<br/>\nnot as cool looking or easy to read as the PDF.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testivus\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testivus</a><br/>\n<br/>\nWhat do you think?  What other tenets should we add to Testivus?  Feel<br/>\nfree to suggest some.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlberto</div>",
