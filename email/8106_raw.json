If it is important that the contents of\n your objects are equal rather than that they are equal by reference, your\n should overwrite their equals and their hashcode method. JUnits\n assertEquals uses\n the equals method of the compared objects, so it depends on the equals\n method\n of your objects.\n\n 2) In my case, I had a lot of value objects which already existed with the\n inherited equals method of the class Object. I wanted to test the equality\n of\n the values in the objects, not their references. However, it was rather\n lot\n of work to rewrite the equals method of thousends of value objects. So I\n subclassed JUnit and wrote an own &#39;assertValueEquals&#39;, which traverses the\n whole\n hierarchy of two given classes and compares only the Types (String,\n integer\n etc.) which hold the &#39;value&#39; of my objects.\n\nHope that helps,\n\nJie\n\n\n\n                                                                                                    \n                    &quot;kartikdg&quot;                                                                      \n                    &lt;kartik_dinakar@s        An:     junit@yahoogroups.com                          \n                    atyam.com&gt;               Kopie:  (Blindkopie: Jie Mei/mummert/de)               \n                                             Thema:  [junit] Object comparison using assertEquals   \n                    20.05.2003 06:52                                                                \n                    Bitte antworten                                                                 \n                    an junit                                                                        \n                                                                                                    \n                                                                                                    \n\n\n\n\nHi,\nI would like to deep compare 2 objects (expectedResult and\nactualResult)\nusing JUnit.\n\nJUnit provides an interface called assertEquals(Object o1, Object o2)\nwhich compares 2 obects by reference and does not perform a deep\ncomparison.\n\nSince the expectedResult and actualResult will never have the same\nreference, does anyone have any idea on how to perform a deep\ncomparison comparing the values of 2 objects) ?\n\nCheers\nKartik\n\n\n\n\nTo unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\njunit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n\n\nYour use of Yahoo!
