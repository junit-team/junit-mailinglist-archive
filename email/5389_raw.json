Easier to automate most of the steps (run x n, merge,\nreport).\n\nLast time I got 0% coverage was because I accidentally had a * exclusion\nfilter.  Check your filters in the Coverage launchpad.\n\nAnother benefit to Ant&#39;s jpcoverage is that the exclusion/inclusion\nmechanism is a little more &quot;in your face.&quot;  And if you use jpcovreport,\nyou get a much nicer looking report than the JProbe HTML report.\n\nScott Stirling\n\n&gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; From: majortaylor [mailto:majortaylor@...] \n&gt; \n&gt; Hi,\n&gt; I&#39;m trying to get some code coverage for my junit tests. I&#39;m using \n&gt; JProbe Coverage from Sitraka software to get the code coverage \n&gt; information.\n&gt; JPCoverage calls ant which in turn runs my unit tests. I&#39;ve been \n&gt; careful to set &quot;fork=&quot;no&quot; in my junit ant task so that my tests run \n&gt; in the same jvm as ant.\n&gt; Despite this, and despite the fact that it&#39;s clear my tests are \n&gt; executing, jpcoverage is still reporting 0% coverage of my \n&gt; code. Does anybody have any experience with this? I&#39;m \n&gt; wondering what I \n&gt; could be doing wrong.\n&gt; I realize that there&#39;s also a jpcoverage ant task which would then \n&gt; run JProbe inside my ant project (rather than vice versa); would this \n&gt; be a superior approach? I suspect I would have the same problem.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt; MT\n\n\n\n\n",
