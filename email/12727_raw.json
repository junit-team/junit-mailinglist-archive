Rainsberger&quot; &lt;jbrains@r...&gt;\nwrote:\n&gt; amit wrote:\n&gt; &gt;    I have tried the sample test, called &quot;JWebUnitSearchExample&quot;\nwhich\n&gt; &gt; performs a Google search for Httpunit and validates the presence\nof\n&gt; &gt; link, given in the documentation of jwebunit.\n&gt; &gt;    I run it through command prompt with command     \n&gt; &gt; &quot;java junit.textui.TestRunner\n&gt; &gt; net.sourceforge.jwebunit.sample.JWebUnitSearchExample&quot;, I am not\nsure\n&gt; &gt; whether it runs successfuly as I dont get any messages and my\nfirewall\n&gt; &gt; alerts me about the application accessing the net. After while the\n&gt; &gt; application returns to command prompt again, displayin no results\nnor\n&gt; &gt; any errors.\n&gt; \n\n\n\n\n&gt; Can you execute the same test in a firewall-free environment? That\nmight \n&gt; tell you where the problem is.\n&gt; \n&gt; Still, I&#39;ve never heard of a test runner /not/ reporting results.\nBy \n&gt; chance, is any of the code anywhere redirecting System.out and \n&gt; System.err? Is the a logfile somewhere you can look through? That&#39;s\none \n&gt; thing I can imagine that would account for the behavior you&#39;re\nseeing.\n&gt; -- \n\nHi..\n\n    As you suggested, I tried runnig the test by disabling the\nfirewall. It worked in both text and graphical mode of junit. I got\nresults with no errors and failures. \n    Enabling the firewall caused same error and everythig was normal\nby disabling it. I could not get what the problem was.\n\n    Anyways, Thanks a lot for your help.\n\nRegards,\nAmit\n\n\n\n\n",
