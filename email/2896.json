Thanks.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;But if the classes and the methods I want to test are abstract, I<br/>\n&gt;can&#39;t know what will happen in the methods of the subclasses which<br/>\n&gt;extend from these abstract classes.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>The only thing that JUnit really tests is the unit (hence the name), where <br/>\na unit is usually (in my experience) a method. It doesn&#39;t test the <br/>\nrelationships between methods - this is a seperate field.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo test an abstract class you&#39;ll need to create a second class that extends <br/>\nthe first, with only the barest of implementations - and then test that.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  Why I asked this question is that<br/>\n&gt;these classes I will test are a framework of our project, many of<br/>\n&gt;them are abstract classes. Our project team must follow this<br/>\n&gt;framework and extend from these abstract classes to develop our<br/>\n&gt;project. Now I was assigned to test if this framework is correct.<br/>\n&gt;What can I do?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Define correct to start with!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat do you really want to test? Junit can be used (as I mentioned above) <br/>\nto test if the individual methods in the base class(es) are doing what you <br/>\nexpect - does a method called &quot;saveFile()&quot; really save a file, and is it <br/>\nthe file you expect; does a method call &quot;reportError(BigError myError)&quot; <br/>\nreally report myError, what happens if myError is null, or...<br/>\nIt won&#39;t tell you if the framework you have is correct, stable etc. It&#39;ll <br/>\nonly give you confidence that the individual classes are stable and &quot;correct&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nJim<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\n<br/>\n                           *   Jim Cheesman   *<br/>\n             Trabajo: <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jchees@...\">jchees@...</a> - (34)(91) 724 9200 x 2360<br/>\n                 I am becoming <br/>\nincreasingly worried that<br/>\n                  there isn&#39;t enough anxiety in <br/>\nmy life.</div>",
