We&#39;ve completely converted - sorry for misleading the topic.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, this leaves me somewhat further afield with specifying more<br/>\nthan one test method to be run using the JUnit 4 APIs. I&#39;ve looked<br/>\nthrough the classes, even regenerating the Javadoc, and can&#39;t find<br/>\nanything. I&#39;m very confused (and a little frustrated) because the<br/>\nclasses or methods I want to use are either undocumented (no Javadoc)<br/>\nor marked for internal use only.<br/>\n<br/>\nAny suggestions?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Michael Schechter&quot; &lt;bard@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; That&#39;s odd - it works just fine for me. However, trying to filter on<br/>\n&gt; more than one method doesn&#39;t seem to be intuitively obvious, and<br/>\n&gt; nothing really seems to work.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The code I use to get one test to run is as follows (it&#39;s from the<br/>\n&gt; test class&#39;s main() method):<br/>\n&gt;     JUnitCore core = new JUnitCore();<br/>\n&gt;     Request testRequest = Request.method(aTestClass, someArguments[0]);<br/>\n&gt;     core.run(testRequest);<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I have no idea how to extend this model to being able to specify<br/>\n&gt; multiple methods, however.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; In addition, I really hope that someone starts documenting all of the<br/>\n&gt; nifty new features in JUnit 4.x - the current level is somewhat<br/>\n&gt; (frustratingly) incomplete. The basic features have been covered by a<br/>\n&gt; number of writers - the more complex, such as this issue, still seem<br/>\n&gt; to be missing.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I think JUnit has the potential to become even more popular with a<br/>\n&gt; clearer examination of the framework on which it is built. There seems<br/>\n&gt; to be a great deal of power and flexibility available - it&#39;s just<br/>\n&gt; really unclear as to how to get at it.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Thanks in advance!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Michael Schechter<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a>, David Saff &lt;saff@&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Shannon,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; You are right--this doesn&#39;t currently work in JUnit 4.1.

I create and run the test like this:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Request r = Request.method(OldStyleTestCase.class,<br/>\n&quot;testSomeMethod&quot;);<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; jcore.run(r);<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; The outcome is that all test methods are run, not just the one test<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; method I specified. I also tried using a custom filter, but the<br/>\nfilter<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; never gets called because the runner for this class is<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; org.junit.internal.runners.OldTestClassRunner which does not<br/>\nimplement<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Filter.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Do I need to write my own runner to get this to work? Is there<br/>\nanother<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; work around?<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks for any help.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; /Shannon<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>",
