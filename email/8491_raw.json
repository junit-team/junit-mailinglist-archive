Maybe its my Smalltalk \n&gt; &gt; background.\n&gt; \n&gt; Probably not. As far as I know, the original framework was SUnit (for\n&gt; Smalltalk) and JUnit is more or less a port to Java.\n&gt; \n\nI gave a talk called &quot;Testing Smalltalk Applications&quot; at the Smalltalk\nSolutions conference in &#39;98 and &#39;99 which included a few words on the\nbenefit of converting &#39;doit&#39; code into test cases, so this is certainly\n(in my mind) a valid approach, although it might be a foreign one to\nanyone who is not used to the ability to type and execute snippets of\ncode within an IDE. \n\nI still think that moving the workspace/scrapbook code into methods that\nreturn values is fine. You can then call them from JUnit style test\nmethods that assert(...) things about the returned values. Then you get\nyour methods in the form you want and can use JUnit for its ability to\ncatalog and automatically execute tests, as well as assert and log state\nwhere it is appropriate.\n\n---\nOutgoing mail is certified Virus Free.\nChecked by AVG anti-virus system (http://www.grisoft.com).\nVersion: 6.0.489 / Virus Database: 288 - Release Date: 6/10/2003\n \n\n\n",
