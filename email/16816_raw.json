No one here is arguing \n&gt; against the relevance o=\r\nf QA departments and testing. However test first \n&gt; development is primaril=\r\ny about *development*, not testing. It is a \n&gt; programming strategy. That s=\r\ntrategy depends critically on writing the \n&gt; unit tests in sync with the co=\r\nde. It depends critically on applying \n&gt; human intelligence to the code so =\r\nthe *humans* develop better \n&gt; understanding of what they want. These are n=\r\not side issues. They are at \n&gt; the core of test driven development.\n\nHi Ell=\r\niotte,\n\nI understand the concept and mission of Test-First/TDD, support its=\r\n\nuse in-house, and I&#39;ve had some personal successes with it.  I also\ntry to=\r\n make sure that the tools we develop try to support some mode of\nTDD.  But =\r\nTDD is not the battle I am choosing to personally fight. \nFirst because the=\r\nre are many other people more qualified, more\npassionate, and more convince=\r\nd than I am about its benefits and\ngeneral/broad applicability (just look a=\r\nt this forum).  Second,\nbecause I believe that the best way to get develope=\r\nrs to consider and\nappreciate TDD or other &quot;more rigorous&quot; forms/discipline=\r\ns of\ndesign/testing is to get them to consider and appreciate testing in\nth=\r\ne first place; and accept that testing their own code is a\nprofessional res=\r\nponsibility (I like Bob Martin&#39;s analogy of doctors\nhaving to wash their ha=\r\nnds before surgery).\n\nWhen I say &quot;Test-first or test-last? Either one as lo=\r\nng as you test&quot;,\nI am not saying that there&#39;s no difference betweeen the tw=\r\no\napproaches, or trivializing it.  I am saying, that as far as I am\nconcern=\r\ned, both approaches are OK with me.  Either approach is a big\nimprovement o=\r\nver the current situations where most developers don&#39;t\ntest.  I am trying t=\r\no bring developers in the testing camp in the\nfirst place, once in the camp=\r\n they can start to appreciate the value\nof testing and then decide for them=\r\nselves if test-first is for them.\n\nIn summary: I am most interested/passion=\r\nate in getting developers to\ntake responsibility for testing their code - w=\r\nriting tests for testing\nsake if you will. I see people who practice and pr=\r\nomote TDD as allies;\nI understand and respect their beliefs and practices, =\r\nbut I also\naccept, understand, and welcome people who don&#39;t want to practic=\r\ne TDD.\n\nDo you believe that promoting the idea of developer testing without=\r\n\ndirectly promoting TDD (i.e. saying that if developers write tests\nthey sh=\r\nould only write them before the code) harms the TDD cause?  \n\nOr that menti=\r\noning test-first in a more general &quot;developers should\nwrite tests&quot; message =\r\n&quot;cheapens&quot; TDD because TDD is about design and\nnot testing?\n\nI am asking th=\r\nese questions not to start/continue an argument.  I\nsincerely want to under=\r\nstand where you stand.\n\nAlberto\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
