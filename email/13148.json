Sure, I could<br/>\nextend TestCase to periodically call a function in its TestResult<br/>\n(oops, it has no reference to it!), which would then propogate to the<br/>\nTestListener, and then somehow output the data. But...no. That was SO<br/>\nmuch more work than it seemed like it should have been. Too many<br/>\nprivate elements, too much reflection.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut it seems like a useful feature. Perhaps one that others might have<br/>\nexplored in the past. Has anyone looked at this? Is there an extension<br/>\nout there that implements it?<br/>\n<br/>\nAaron</div>",
