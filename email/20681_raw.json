The key is understanding\nthat in 4.5 every test is run by a &quot;block&quot; of &quot;statements&quot; (see\nhttp://threeriversi nstitute. org/TwoMoreImple mentationPattern s.htm for more\ndetails). Befores and afters are run by statements high up in the block. The\nlast statement in the block just invokes the test method. You can modify\nthis behavior by wrapping this statement in a statement that measures time.\nHere&#39;s an overview of the sample code below:\n* NanoTimer is a little utility to measure time (at the end we&#39;ll make\nsure that timing just the test takes less than half the time of timing the\ntest including @Before and @After)\n* MeasuringInvoker wraps a Statement and times it. You will probably want\nto save your timing measurements somewhere for later reporting.\n* The MeasuringRunner extends the default BlockJUnit4ClassRun ner by\nwrapping the superclass&#39; default invoker with our MeasuringInvoker.\n\nThat&#39;s the body of the extension.. What follows is a self-test of the code.\nThe sample class has a @Before and @After to start and end measuring the\noverall time. The test ensures that the time required for just the test\nmethod is less than half of the time required for the whole test including\nbefores and afters.\n\nI hope this helps.\n\nRegards,\n\nKent Beck\nThree Rivers Institute\npublic class MeasureTestOnlyTime Test {\n\nstatic class NanoTimer {\nprivate long start;\nprivate long end;\npublic void start() { start= System.nanoTime( ); }\npublic void end() { end= System.nanoTime( ); }\npublic long duration() { return end - start; }\n}\n\nstatic NanoTimer all= new NanoTimer();\nstatic NanoTimer justTest= new NanoTimer();\n\nstatic class MeasuringInvoker extends Statement {\nprivate final Statement invoker;\n\npublic MeasuringInvoker( Statement invoker) {\nthis.invoker= invoker;\n}\n\n@Override\npublic void evaluate() throws Throwable {\njustTest.start( );\ninvoker.evaluate( );\njustTest.end( );\n}\n}\n\npublic static class MeasuringRunner extends BlockJUnit4ClassRun ner {\npublic MeasuringRunner( Class&lt; ? &gt; klass) throws InitializationError {\nsuper(klass) ;\n}\n\n@Override\nprotected Statement invoke(FrameworkMet hod method, Object test) {\nreturn new MeasuringInvoker( super.invoke( method, test));\n}\n}\n\n@RunWith(MeasuringR unner.class)\npublic static class LongBeforeAndAfter {\n@Before public void before() {\nall.start();\n}\n@After public void after() {\nall.end();\n}\n@Test public void test() {\n}\n}\n\n@Test public void dontMeasureBeforeAn dAfter() {\nJUnitCore.runClasse s(LongBeforeAndA fter.class) ;\nassertTrue(all. duration( ) &gt; justTest.duration( ) * 2);\n}\n}\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n    \n\n\n      Download prohibited?
