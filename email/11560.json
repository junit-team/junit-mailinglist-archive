GSBase, for example, runs tests at approximately <br/>\n100/second, and that&#39;s my usual performance goal for tests. On my most <br/>\nrecent project, I separated tests that required expensive, external <br/>\nresources (there were about 10) from tests than ran entirely in memory <br/>\n(there were about 400). The in-memory tests ran in about 6 seconds.<br/>\n<br/>\nIs this &quot;noticeable&quot; by your standards? I&#39;d merely like some extra context.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">  &gt; It is also less<br/>\n&gt; efficient to do so because it ignores the idea of<br/>\n&gt; levelization (from John Lakos&#39; underappreciated book<br/>\n&gt; &quot;Large Scale C++ Software Design&quot;). In incremental dev<br/>\n&gt; mode it would be more efficient to execute only the<br/>\n&gt; testcases that correspond to the product package(s)<br/>\n&gt; that&#39;s just changed (and the dependency closure<br/>\n&gt; thereof) AND execute them in increasing level numbers<br/>\n&gt; (reverse package dependency topological order).<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This is a great idea, however, computing the complete dependency closure <br/>\nis awfully tricky. For most algorithms that attempt to do this, I can <br/>\nload a class through reflection and use it, breaking the algorithm&#39;s <br/>\nassertion that it correctly computes the runtime dependency closure. I&#39;m <br/>\nnot saying it&#39;s impossible -- although it might be -- but I am doubtful <br/>\nthat any existing tool does this adequately and could be integrated into <br/>\nEclipse, for example.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; A tool/framework that enforces test (sub)suite<br/>\n&gt; execution in increasing level numbers would seem like<br/>\n&gt; the next evolutionary step after naive TDD. Does<br/>\n&gt; anyone know of such a tool? The testcase-&gt;app package<br/>\n&gt; assignment could be done by simply placing testcases<br/>\n&gt; in the relevant package (common practice already<br/>\n&gt; anyway) or by something like Java 1.5 metadata<br/>\n&gt; tagging.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;m not aware of anything, but if it exists, the C#/.NET world would be <br/>\na likely first place to look. They&#39;ve had metadata tagging longer than <br/>\nJava folks have.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; There are tools to analyze existing package<br/>\n&gt; dependencies, but I am not aware of a test framework<br/>\n&gt; to actually relate that data to testcase execution<br/>\n&gt; ordering.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Those tools likely only analyze compile-time (structural) dependecies, <br/>\nand as I wrote above, it would be all too easy to exhibit a runtime <br/>\ndependency that such an analyzer would miss. The result is that runtime <br/>\nbehavior might change without the analyzer knowing to run all the <br/>\nappropriate tests.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am admittedly shaky on the theory, and welcome being proven wrong, but <br/>\nI have this vague notion that I&#39;m right.<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJ.
