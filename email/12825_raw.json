Try:\nhttp://groups.yahoo.com/group/junit/message/12807?threaded=1\nThis is probably a better alternative than having these reposted.\n \n&gt; I basically only used checked exceptions because the way I \n&gt; understand it: runtime exceptions are for circumstances that you\ncan \n&gt; not foresee and therefore can not handle.\nThis appears to be conventional wisdom, as you&#39;ve noticed from the\njava tutorial.  I disagree wholeheartedly - whether an exception is\nforeseable has nothing to do with whether it should be &#39;checked&#39;; in\nfact no api has any business /forcing/ client code to handle a given\nexception.  Instead an api should document the exceptions it may\ngenerate and let the client decide whether/where to deal with it.\n\n&gt; To extend the example below with the FileNotFoundException, What is\n&gt; the effect of throwing a runtime exception? Will the program \n&gt; terminate with this exception? Also if the name of the file was \n&gt; chosen by the user instead, would it be better to use a checked \n&gt; exception?\nThe only practical difference with using a runtime exception is that\nit doesn&#39;t force clients to code a catch for it.  For example, assume\nthe code in question was within the method:\n\n    public InputStream open() throws FileNotFoundException\n\nThis forces all users of the method to write catch blocks.  If we\nconvert the exception to a RuntimeException, say:\n\n    class RuntimeFileNotFoundException extends RuntimeException {...\n\nAnd we change openFileInputStream() to:\n    public InputStream open() throws RuntimeFileNotFoundException()\n\nNow, client code has a choice: if they are actually going to do\nsomething about the exception, they can catch\nRuntimeFileNotFoundException; otherwise, they can just let it\npropogate up the call stack (the compiler doesn&#39;t force a catch block\nfor RTEs).\n\nTo answer your question about whether your system will terminate\nbecause you used a RTE:  all programs should have some top-level\nexception handling code.  The nature of this handler depends on your\ncontext - a web application will respond differently to a batch\nprocessing app.  If a RTE propogates all the way up your callstack, it\nshould be caught by this handler.\n\nWould i use a checked exception if the user chose the name of the\nfile? No. Consider two scenarios:\n1. The user expected the file to be there: in this case, something has\n/already/ gone wrong if the file doesn&#39;t exist - find /that/ bug and\nfix it instead.  Coding a catch block for something that shouldn&#39;t\nhappen is like lying to cover an earlier lie.\n2. The file may or may not exist: this means there are two predictable\noutcomes we have to code for.  We should be using an if/else to code\nfor them.  Using exceptions to control predictable program flow is a\ncomom code smell and should be avoided.\n\nNeither of the scenarios above requires any exception handling (except\nof course the top-level handler).\n\nI suspect we are getting of topic - particularly for a junit mailing\nlist.  Lets take this discussion offline if you&#39;d like to continue...\n\nCheers, lasitha.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
