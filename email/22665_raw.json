If you want to know whether your candid=\r\nate can actually do TDD (as claimed on their resume), then there&#39;s only one=\r\n good way to find out. And a candidate that started by testing all the exot=\r\nic failure states, rather than working through the most useful features, wo=\r\nuld have revealed that they probably don&#39;t understand incremental developme=\r\nnt.\n\nS.\n\n\nOn 1 May 2010, at 23:53, C=C3=A9dric Beust =E2=99=94 wrote:\n&gt; I t=\r\nhink asking candidates to do TDD in an interview is a waste of time.\n&gt; \n&gt; Y=\r\nou have about forty-five minutes to find out how good that candidate is and=\r\n\n&gt; if you ask her to solve a problem and to begin by writing tests the TDD =\r\nway,\n&gt; you&#39;ll waste fifteen minutes seeing code that tests for easy cases, =\r\nnulls\n&gt; and exceptions.  Not exactly enlightening.\n&gt; \n&gt; I prefer to focus o=\r\nn coding problems and possibly mentioning tests and\n&gt; hearing what they hav=\r\ne to say about it.  It&#39;s also perfectly okay with me if\n&gt; all they talk abo=\r\nut is &quot;automated&quot; tests and not TDD, I don&#39;t think that TDD\n&gt; is a requirem=\r\nent to write good tests, nor does it tell me much about how\n&gt; good that can=\r\ndidate is.\n\n\nSteve Freeman\nhttp://www.growing-object-oriented-software.com\n=\r\n\n\n",
