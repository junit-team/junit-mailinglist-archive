To test methods that only modify private fields like you\ndescribe, you can use reflection (which I would personally prefer).  Use\nthe object&#39;s getClass() method then Class&#39;s getField() method.  Field\nextends java.lang.reflect.AccessibleObject which has a\nsetAccessible(boolean) method you can use to gain access to a private\nfield through reflection.  Field has getter methods for its value.\n \nA security manager can be set up to prevent this bypassing of the\nprivate restriction, but by default you are allowed to do it.\n \nMatt\n\n\t-----Original Message-----\n\tFrom: J.

If you&#39;re concerned about hiding these extra\nmethods \n\tfrom client, then hide them behind an interface.\n\t\n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\n\n\n",
