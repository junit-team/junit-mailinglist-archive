Upon running its 200 <br/>\nsome odd tests, it creates a report of the results of the tests.  OK, <br/>\nsounds like something JUnit might be able to handle.  However, the <br/>\nbasic test that I want to to compare the output file with the <br/>\nexpected result file.  If the files do differ, then I&#39;d like a <br/>\nlisting of ALL the places where they differ.  Is there anything in <br/>\nJUnit or any of its extensions that does something like this?  I know <br/>\nthis is not really unit testing, more like black box application <br/>\ntesting, but I like the formatting and gui options of JUnit and would <br/>\nlike to be able to use it if possible.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThanks in advance,<br/>\nAdam</div>",
