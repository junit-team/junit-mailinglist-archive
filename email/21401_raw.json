If there is\ninter=\r\nest, I would be happy to contribute a patch to the JUnit project\nto address=\r\n it. On the other hand, if there is a way to solve this\nproblem differently=\r\n in JUnit already, please let me know.\n\nAnt and IDEA (the IDE from Intellij=\r\n) don&#39;t agree on how to gather\nclasses for test. IDEA inspects the actual c=\r\nlass for things that\nextend TestCase or have a JUnit annotation on the clas=\r\ns (or have a\nstatic suite method) and executes the test. Ant gathers tests =\r\nvia\nclass names. To use the Ant method with JUnit outside of Ant, you can\nu=\r\nse JUnitCore, and just pass it an array of classes gathered in the\nAnt form=\r\n. However IDEA doesn&#39;t report those results in its typical\nfashion. It uses=\r\n its own custom runner to gather and run these tests.\n\nThe only option I se=\r\ne in the JUnit current code is to make a custom\nrunner that knows how to ex=\r\ntract a Class[] array and pass it on to the\nstandard runner, and then use t=\r\nhe RunWith tag to annotate an arbitrary\nclass to get IDEA to think that it =\r\nis running a test suite. I haven&#39;t\nactually done this to see if IDEA has an=\r\ny issues, but it seems like it\nshould work.\n\nMy proposal is to add an annot=\r\nation to the Suite class called\nSuiteMethod that would annotate a method th=\r\nat returns a Class[] array.\nThe Suite would then be built from the two anno=\r\ntations,\nSuite.SuiteClasses plus any methods on the class (we could enforce=\r\n\nthat they be public, static, take no parameters and return a Class[]\narray=\r\n) that are annotated with Suite.SuiteMethod and build the Suite\nas a combin=\r\nation of all of the Arrays returned.\n\nWhat do you think?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
