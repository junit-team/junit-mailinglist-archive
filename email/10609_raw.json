For example, for &#39;A&#39; you don&#39;t even\nneed to issue the query. Just write tests that verify the SQL. Mock\nobjects help here.\n\nFor &#39;B&#39; and &#39;C&#39; You might also try using a database that has a small,\nknown subset of data in it so you don&#39;t need to process as much, or use\na mock database.\n\nIn #2 again, it appears that the primary concern of the tests may be\nvalidating the SQL that is generated and not what is returned by the\ncall, but I could be wrong.\n\n-----------------------------\nMike Silverstein\nSilverMark, Inc.\nThe Object Testing Company\nwww.silvermark.com\n\n&gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; From: mirumoto_kojiro [mailto:mirumoto_kojiro@...] \n&gt; Sent: Saturday, March 06, 2004 8:54 AM\n&gt; To: junit@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Subject: [junit] Test case strategy for complex tests\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m writing test cases for EJB&#39;s and some of the beans do \n&gt; some complex SQL \n&gt; generation and return large amounts of data,  Realizing that \n&gt; test cases should be \n&gt; simple... Should I just test that the query runs without \n&gt; error and not worry about the \n&gt; return?  Or should I check certain parts to make sure thay \n&gt; are right?  Or check the \n&gt; entire result set?\n&gt; \n&gt; Question#2: I have many SQL queries with multiple \n&gt; possiblities in the WHERE clause.  \n&gt; They are being built on the fly based on the search criteria \n&gt; given by a user.  I was \n&gt; going to test each WHERE clause in a seperate test. Should I \n&gt; write the tests in such a \n&gt; way that I could combine calls to them and have a test case \n&gt; that is more of a \n&gt; controller pattern?\n&gt; pseudo code as follows\n&gt; &lt;code&gt;\n&gt; public void combinedTest1(){\n&gt;      SearchVO search = buildSearchVO ( add two parameters);\n&gt;      \n&gt;      performSearchTest(search);\n&gt; \n&gt;      search = buildSearchVO(two other parameters);\n&gt; \n&gt;       performSearchTest(search);\n&gt; }&lt;/code&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n---\nOutgoing mail is certified Virus Free.\nChecked by AVG anti-virus system (http://www.grisoft.com).\nVersion: 6.0.576 / Virus Database: 365 - Release Date: 1/30/2004\n \n\n\n",
