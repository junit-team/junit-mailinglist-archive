Suites gather Tests suites, but<br/>\ndon&#39;t contain tests themselves. @Test methods in a suite don&#39;t get<br/>\nexecuted, since a suite is not a test.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; BeforeClass and AfterClass are also static methods and the functionality I need to implement is once per instance, not once for all instances.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere is what I don&#39;t quite understand: Once per instance of what?<br/>\nDo you mean once before every test-method that is executed and once<br/>\nafter every test method that is executed?<br/>\nOr do you mean once before the suite and once after the suite?<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Is there a pattern in JUnit for BeforeSuite and AfterSuite functionality?<br/>\n<br/>\nThe pattern I know of is: @BeforeClass and @AfterClass in the Suite-class.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you want to execute once before every test method and once after<br/>\nevery test method, you need @Before-methods and @After-methods in the<br/>\ntests. Or use JUnit 4.8 @Rule<br/>\n<br/>\nGreetings,<br/>\n    Malte </span></blockquote></div>",
