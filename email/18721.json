I feel obligated to <br/>\nthrow in a bunch of computer science buzzwords (greedy algorithms, <br/>\nNP-complete, etc.) This is, undoubtedly, a side effect of poor early <br/>\ntraining :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">  &gt;<br/>\n &gt; We can agree that no program can ever automatically assess the<br/>\n &gt; programmer&#39;s intent, but it is possible to enumerate efficiently all<br/>\n &gt; known (input, output) pairs for sufficiently simple methods, depending<br/>\n &gt; on the size of the domain and range of the method. The problem is that<br/>\n &gt; where I would really want automatic enumeration of all tests, it would<br/>\n &gt; either be impossible (consider the case of depending on an interface) <br/>\n &gt; or<br/>\n &gt; untimely (consider the case of billions of possible inputs).<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;m not sure I proposed exhaustive testing of every possible input <br/>\ncombination, all I wanted to do was let the characterization tests make <br/>\nsure the software was doing something correctly, and add a set of <br/>\nguidance tests to allow the test generator to also test that it is doing <br/>\nthe correct thing.  This may still be a large set, but it is the same <br/>\nproblem faced by humans who develop a test set: &quot;When do you have enough <br/>\ntests?&quot;  (Ooops, time for one more compsci buzzword: halting problem). <br/>\nSo, on the question of what is 100%, it depends on scope to a degree. <br/>\nWhen do you stop testing your code, and begin testing the compiler, the <br/>\nruntime machine, the library, etc.?<br/>\n<br/>\nPerhaps a more reasonable goal would be an automated test generator that <br/>\nwould produce a test set that met or exceeded the tests produced by a <br/>\nreasonably good human.  Essentially a &#39;best parctices&#39; goal.<br/>\n<br/>\nJim<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJames P.
