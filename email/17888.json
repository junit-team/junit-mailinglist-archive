This is <br/>\nwhy, over time, we have to instruct and correct them less, and let them <br/>\nmake increasingly more and more important mistakes. They learn more from <br/>\nthat feedback than they learn from being corrected.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf we constantly relieve programmers of the responsibility of reading <br/>\nthe documentation or tests, then they will certainly never do it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI suppose we need both camps: some API publishers who insist their users <br/>\nact like adults and some API publishers who allow users to act like <br/>\nbabies. Without the former, all programmers settle to the level of <br/>\nbabies; and without the latter, not enough work gets done while waiting <br/>\nfor the babies to start thinking for themselves.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo perhaps this isn&#39;t and either/or scenario.<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJ.
