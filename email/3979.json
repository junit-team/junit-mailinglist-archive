It becomes very important to test only things that can <br/>\nbreak.  This is the number one argument I see people use against Test <br/>\nFirst.  Don&#39;t test setters/getters, DB reads and writes, container <br/>\nmanaged persistence, etc. unless they start breaking.  The best way <br/>\nto determine things are breaking is by having <br/>\nacceptance/system/functional/integration tests.  If you have a broken <br/>\nacceptance test then you are probably missing at least one unit test.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs others have pointed out in the long term there is no overhead, as <br/>\nit cuts down on debugging time so much.  Personally I know that test <br/>\nfirst makes people go faster.  I see this every time I teach a <br/>\nclass.  Inevitable one or two pairs don&#39;t do test first.  These are <br/>\nalso the folks who finish the assignment last (or not at all).<br/>\n<br/>\nErik Meade<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://junit.org\">http://junit.org</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:emeade@...\">emeade@...</a></div>",
