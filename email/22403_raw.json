Perhaps someone h=\r\nere can help?\n\n&gt; Can anybody shed light on this definition of the parallel =\r\nattribute in the  plugin docs?\n&gt; \n&gt; ......\n&gt; \n&gt; parallel \t\n&gt; \n&gt; String \t2.2=\r\n \t(TestNG only) When you use the parallel attribute, TestNG will try to run=\r\n all your test methods in separate threads, except for methods      that de=\r\npend on each other, which will be run in the same thread in order to respec=\r\nt their order of execution.\n&gt; \n&gt;  In JUnit 4.7 the values are classes/metho=\r\nds/both to run in separate threads, as controlled by threadCount.\n&gt; \n&gt; ....=\r\n.\n&gt; \n&gt; I have junit test tests and when I set parallel =3D methods it runs =\r\neverything synchronously, however when I set parallel =3D classes, it runs =\r\nthe classes in parallel. I haven&#39;t been able to find good documentation for=\r\n this anywhere.. Does anybody know of any good resources? \n&gt; \n&gt; Also, assum=\r\ning I can get methods to work, does it run all methods in parallel or does =\r\nit run the methods in parallel by class? i.e. 1 class at a time but all the=\r\n methods in that class are parallel?\n&gt; \n&gt; Are there other gotchas or config=\r\nuration settings I should be considering? I.E. I&#39;ve read a little bit on Co=\r\nnfigurableParallelComputer but I&#39;m not sure what it&#39;s all about..\n\n\n",
