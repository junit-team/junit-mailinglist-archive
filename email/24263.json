That said, it&#39;s likely to be at least a month or two before there&#39;s a finalized release that incorporates this.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Oh. That&#39;s a faster timeframe than I was expecting.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; In the meantime, would it make sense to add a section to the wiki that explains how someone can use RuntimeSuite and the existing features of JUnit to get what Mark&#39;s team originally wanted in Eclipse/maven/command-line/etc?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I developed RuntimeSuite at a client who was just starting to use Maven.  We invoked the suite by configuring surefire like this:<br/>\n\t&lt;configuration&gt;<br/>\n\t\t&lt;includes&gt;<br/>\n\t\t\t&lt;include&gt;path/to/my/SuiteClass.java&lt;/include&gt;<br/>\n\t\t&lt;/includes&gt;<br/>\n\t&lt;/configuration&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nYou could generalize that by using a property instead of naming a specific class.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s the extent of my understanding of how to use RuntimeSuite with Maven.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo does that (admittedly minimal) guidance suffice for Maven?<br/>\n<br/>\nI have no idea what&#39;s required to integrate anything with Eclipse (or IntelliJ IDEA).<br/>\n<br/>\nAt my client, we weren&#39;t doing anything trickier than configuring Maven to run our suite class.  We never, for example, used properties or command line args to configure finders and filters.  In fact, none of the finders and filters built into RuntimeSuite were configurable at runtime.  Everything they know, they know at compile time.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat said, people /could/ implement their own finders and filters, configurable at runtime in whatever way suits them.  Because finders and filters are implemented as rules, you can hand their constructors any configuration options you desire, as long as you know how to get the options to the constructors.  (A simple matter of programming?)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  The hope would be that this would move at least a few teams from &quot;I give up&quot; to &quot;I&#39;m glad this will get easier, but at least we&#39;re up and running&quot;.  In the process of generating it, we might also unearth some corner cases that would nice to know before baking things in (for example, will our recommended Eclipse solution work in the presence of tests loaded into OSGi containers?)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I am entirely ignorant of OSGI.<br/>\n<br/>\nDale<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nDale Emery<br/>\nConsultant to software teams and leaders<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://dhemery.com\">http://dhemery.com</a></div>",
