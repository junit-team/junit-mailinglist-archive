Put<br/>\n&gt; as much of the logic as possible into POJOs and/or taglibs, and test those<br/>\n&gt; the usual way.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; If you really need to test the JSPs, you can use jWebUnit with ServletUnit<br/>\n&gt; as the test container (the latter comes with httpUnit), or Jetty as an<br/>\n&gt; embedded webserver.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>When I tried faking the web container, I found that the JSP processor <br/>\npulls in such crazy stuff -- like Ant! -- that the complexity of the <br/>\ntest environment was no longer worth the effort. For that reason, I <br/>\ncannot emphasize enough the need to push as much of the JSP out into <br/>\nplain Java (POJOs or taglibs, as you say). The best you can do is test <br/>\nthe JSPs independently of the application that uses them, so write a <br/>\ntest servlet that allows you to stick arbitrary data into the Request, <br/>\nthen forwards to the JSP. This way you can test various error conditions <br/>\nby simulating, not recreating them. It&#39;s not as nice as (say) Velocity, <br/>\nbut it&#39;ll do.<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJ. B.
