What I&#39;ve done to \nsupport launching GUI apps once per suite is put the launch/terminate in \nexplicitly similar to setUp/tearDown, and added hooks to enable/disable \nthese functions.  This way, if each test is run on its own or invoked \nfrom the JUnit runner, it works properly.  If run as a suite, I extended \na TestSuite to enable launch on the first test and terminate on the last.\n\nT.\n\n\nOn Sunday, March 24, 2002, at 10:52 AM, Sobti, Aparna (Aparna) wrote:\n\n&gt; Hi,\n&gt;\n&gt; I am trying to run a script within the setUp() method.
