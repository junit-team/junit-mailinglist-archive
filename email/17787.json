Minimally, the app must have requirements <br/>\n&gt; doc signed by user&#39;s/vendor, traceability to design documents from <br/>\n&gt; requirements, traceability from requirements to unit, system and <br/>\n&gt; user acceptance tests, plus a varitey of additional higher level <br/>\n&gt; validation strategy and test plan documents.  Usually the <br/>\n&gt; traceability is shown as a traceability matrix. The evidence of all <br/>\n&gt; the tests and dev processes must be archived, signed, etc. This is <br/>\n&gt; mostly just standard good software development practice but ideally <br/>\n&gt; I need all these elements for junit to make the QA police <br/>\n&gt; comfortable.  <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>  I have no experience in developing software w/ this degree of<br/>\nformalism, and this post made me curious: I&#39;d understand that all the<br/>\nvalidation is required of the components included w/ the software, but I<br/>\ndon&#39;t really understand that it is required of the development tools,<br/>\ntoo. Is it required that the debugger is validated? The compiler? The<br/>\nIDE? The OS? The JVM? Actually, the OS and the JVM are pretty important<br/>\nfor the correct functioning of the software, as is the compiler.<br/>\n<br/>\n  As I see it, unit tests are a development tool - they aren&#39;t (usually)<br/>\nshipped w/ the software. You could, in principle, write and use unit<br/>\ntests, but keep their sources and binaries in a separate place and never<br/>\neven tell the auditors they exist, and the auditors would not know to<br/>\nmiss them. I&#39;m not suggesting you do this, I&#39;m just a little confused as<br/>\nto why a development tool needs to be validated.<br/>\n  Thenagain, if you want to use junit to validate your software<br/>\nformally, then I guess the validation tool itself needs to be validated?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n       -Antti-</div>",
