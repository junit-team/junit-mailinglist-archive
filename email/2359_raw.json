Any licensee\nwho has validated their Java implementation should be able to tell you\nabout it.\n\nI believe it was never released publicly outside of the TCK tests.\n\nIt is a harness for running tests.\n\nThe product that Sun scrapped was called Java Star.  It did GUI automation\ntesting by plopping stuff into the event queue, and also some kind of\ncapture/record/playback was involved.  However, since it does it through\nthe event queue, I found it entirely useless to my needs and Robot does\nthe specific automation things that I need (ya have to build stuff around\nRobot though, but so what).\n\n\n- David\n\n\n\nOn Tue, 14 Aug 2001, Mike Clark wrote:\n\n&gt; Richard Jensen wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m trying to get a team to use JUnit to do automated unit testing.\n&gt; &gt; One of our members referenced &#39;JavaTest&#39; from Sun and gave me a .pdf\n&gt; &gt; document (~180 pages) with a description of it.
