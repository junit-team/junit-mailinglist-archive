Yikes!  It is very confusing about how to\n&gt; start and how to set up an application level test suite that will touch all\n&gt; the classes.\n\n\n- Forget about strictly applying XP and test-first concept.  Don&#39;t write \ntests for a class if you don&#39;t need to.\n- Start from the top.  I imagine that your application is somewhat \nrunning: First write some general tests that exercise the application or \nuse reports from your QA.  Once you have discovered a class with \npotential bugs, try to test your class. If you can&#39;t write tests, you \nmay have to refactor the class (and write tests before refactoring)\n- maybe JUnit is too &quot;unit-centered&quot; to help you.  Have a look at \ncommercial products (TestMentor by SylverMark or others): they may \nenable you to faster cover your application with several testing methods \n(and not only unit testing).\n- by analysing your code and report some metrics (complexity, \ninheritence, coupling...), you may be able to guess the classes that are \nthe mose likely to be bugged (have a look at JDepend from Mike Clark)\n\nThese are only guesses since I never faced a similar situation (in Java) \nbut it would be _really_ interesting to have some kind of &quot;How to \nsurvive a not tested project&quot; article.\n\n-Vladimir\n\n-- \nVladimir Bossicard\nwww.bossicard.com\n\n\n",
