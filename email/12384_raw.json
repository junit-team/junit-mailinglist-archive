I&#39;ve now come to add some more\n&gt; code within another (set of) class(es).  In doing so I note some\n&gt; commonality between this and the old code, so have abstracted it.  The\n&gt; old code still works - I know this because of its unit tests.  Now the\n&gt; question should I (at point of extraction) move/create a set of tests\n&gt; for the extracted functionality?  Initially (pragmatically) I think not\n&gt; because the extraction is due to hygienic reasons and the code is\n&gt; already covered (as I am testing the behaviour of class A - the fact it\n&gt; now uses class B seems irrelevant) and I don&#39;t have time (the usual\n&gt; caveat) to do this... \n&gt; \n&gt; And yet if I&#39;d hit upon the need for this extraction earlier in the\n&gt; process I&#39;d have written B first along with a set of tests then written\n&gt; A to use B and injected a fake B into A to drive its tests.  So from\n&gt; that standpoint the later would have resulted in better unit test\n&gt; coverage than the former.\n&gt; \n&gt; How do other people handle this type of refactoring and unit test\n&gt; management and what they do?\n\nAs B grows, you&#39;ll start to add tests for B on its own, which will make \nit easier to notice that some of its tests are here and others are \nthere. If this becomes a problem -- and it isn&#39;t always -- that&#39;s the \npoint at which I&#39;d start moving tests.\n\nNow it seems that A instantiates B directly, based on your description. \nIf that&#39;s true, then I would consider refactoring A to allow me to \ninject B into it, and see how the tests would change. Perhaps YAGNI, and \nas you say, you need to spend your time on other things; however, my \ndesigns have always suffered from too /many/ hardcoded dependencies, and \nnot too /few/.\n-- \nJ. B.
