B. Rainsberger wrote:\n\n&gt; I don&#39;t like the built-in assumption that tests belong to production\n&gt; code. A test is just another client of the production code....\n\nWhile the test code is generally not run in production systems, I think\nof the unit tests as an essential, integral part of any chunk of code.\nLeaving out unit tests would be like--well, leaving out large chunks of\nthe code itself. Code without tests is only half-written code.\n\nSo in that sense, to me, if you&#39;re going to be using files for storage\nof code units anyway, putting the tests in a separate file seems akin to\njust chopping the class randomly in half, and putting half in one file,\nand half in the other. After all, from a TDD programmer&#39;s point of view,\nthe tests and code are an inseparable chunk.\n\n&gt; ...and clients do not belong to providers. The implied dependency is\n&gt; in the wrong direction and generally that way lie dragons.\n\nIn fact, as I&#39;ve been doing more and more acceptance testing, I am\nseeing more and more cases where the code is merely a subservient\ndependency on the test. The tests are, after all, where we specified\njust what the code is to do, and where most of hard work (design and\nspecification) was done. If you remove all the code, it can relatively\neasily be recreated, so long as you have those tests. If you delete the\ntests, you now have a pile of code with no specification of what it\nshould do, only some behaviour that you can&#39;t safely modify. Losing the\ntests and keeping the code is akin in this case to losing your source\ncode and being left only with compiled binaries.\n\n&gt; &gt; I don&#39;t see what the problem with [including tests in production\n&gt; &gt; code] is. It might cause a bit of code bloat, but that&#39;s often not a\n&gt; &gt; problem in many projects.\n&gt;\n&gt; I disagree with the notion that code bloat is not a common problem.\n&gt; Refactoring exists in part because of code bloat.\n\nActually, &quot;code bloat&quot; was possibly the wrong term to use here. I\nwas refering to things like your distribution files getting larger.\nFor example, the JAR files I roll out into production often include\ncompiled versions of all of the unit tests, even though that code is not\nnecessary in production. That may make my JAR file twice the size it\nwould be otherwise, but in most circumstances I don&#39;t really care enough\nto do the work to try to remove the test code.\n\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; This brings up something I am struggling with: in C#/NUnit, we can\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; declare a test without extending TestCase (even if we frequently extend\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; Assert, anyway). Is there some great benefit to this over the way we do\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; it in JUnit, SUnit, RubyUnit, PyUnit, ...?\n&gt;...\n&gt; I know it&#39;s possible, but I don&#39;t know why it&#39;s valuable. Can someone\n&gt; with experience doing both make a comparison? Weblog? Anything?\n\nI think it&#39;s valuable because it gives you a lot more leway to play with\nthe design of your testing framework within a particular application. I\nknow that I often feel that certain refactoring directions I&#39;d like to\ntry are closed to me because of the fairly strict structure of the JUnit\ntesting framework.\n\nA &quot;pain&quot; that I&#39;ve been feeling over the last few years has been the\ntension between code that is in an external library, and code that is\nin &quot;my&quot; source repository. For some things, the pain is bad enough, and\nmy need for flexability strong enough, that I just import the source\ncode for the external package and effectively start maintaining it\nmyself. This introduces a maintenance load, however, if I&#39;m also going\nto track the changes from the external package. I think that being\ngiven more flexability in how one interfaces with an external chunk of\ncode lessens this tension. That&#39;s one thing that has, over the past few\nyears, started driving me away from the very static and declarative Java\nmodel (&quot;this interaface is declared as such, and may only be used in\nthis way&quot;) more towards the Smalltalk model, where an interface can be\nthought of as any group of messages that one object sends to another.\n\nI&#39;m sure that this message is not terribly clear; my thoughts on this\ntopic are actually not terribly well formed at this time. But perhaps it\ngives you an inkling of what I&#39;m grasping towards here.\n\ncjs\n-- \nCurt Sampson  &lt;cjs@...&gt;   +81 90 7737 2974   http://www.NetBSD.org\n    Don&#39;t you know, in this new Dark Age, we&#39;re all light.  --XTC\n\n",
