And once you learn the basics, and if you find that you are working\non a project that does not already have tests, I highly recommend\n&quot;Working Effectively With Legacy Code&quot; by Michael Feathers on Prentice\nHall press.  The book does a great job of showing some real-world\nscenarios for how to add tests to code that wasn&#39;t designed for testing,\nand you learn more about how to make testable code from the start.  \n\n\n\nDaniel Wellman\n\nU.S. Trust\n\nPh: (201) 533-6157\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: junit@yahoogroups.com [mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com] On Behalf Of\nSimon Chappell\nSent: Friday, July 15, 2005 2:30 PM\nTo: junit@yahoogroups.com\nSubject: Re: [junit] Beginner\n\n\n\nPriyanka,\n\nWelcome to the wonderful world of JUnit.\n\nThere are many useful websites for the JUnit user, but perhaps the two\nmain ones are http://junit.org/ and http://google.com/.\n&lt;http://google.com/&gt;  The JUnit site\nmaintains alot of useful information and links to other resources.\nGoogle is useful when there&#39;s something you need, but don&#39;t know what\nit is. Just type a description in, press enter and see how much help\nit can be. I&#39;ve found quite a few useful things that way.\n\nAs far as books are concerned, I recommend Pragmatic Unit Testing by\nHunt and Thomas for beginners. JUnit recipies by Rainsberger is good\nonce you&#39;re past the basics.\n\nI hope that this helps.\n\nSimon\n\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe message contains confidential and/or legally privileged\ninformation and is intended for use by the indicated addressee. \n\nIf you are not the intended addressee: (a) any disclosure,\nreproduction, distribution or action you take because of it is\nstrictly prohibited; (b) please return the complete message to the\nsender; and (c) this message is not a solicitation for purchase or\nsale or an agreement of any kind whatsoever that binds the sender.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\n\n\n",
