B. Rainsberger\n&gt; \n&gt;  &gt; Agreed, TestNG supports this out of the box, but for every\n&gt;  &gt; neat feature TestNG supports out of the box there will be 20\n&gt;  &gt; people crying about this other neat feature it doesn&#39;t\n&gt;  &gt; support...\n&gt; \n&gt; Uh, that&#39;s quite a bold statement.  I have certainly not heard anything like\n&gt; this on our mailing-list...\n\nWait until you have 100,000 users. :)\n\n&gt;  &gt; it&#39;s for that reason that JUnit doesn&#39;t even try. :)\n&gt; \n&gt; My impression is that JUnit doesn&#39;t try simply because its authors didn&#39;t\n&gt; envision that this feature would one day be needed.  Nothing wrong with\n&gt; that, you can&#39;t always predict what the future will hold.\n\nPerhaps, but Kent has said quite publicly that he and Erich intended \nJUnit to be the /intersection/, not the /union/, of the feature sets \npeople demanded.\n\n&gt;  &gt; One big difference between the two is that JUnit assumes that\n&gt;  &gt; the test suite is computed before the first test runs, and I\n&gt;  &gt; admit that is a fundamental and useful difference between\n&gt;  &gt; JUnit and TestNG. I suppose once TestNG has a large user base\n&gt;  &gt; we&#39;ll have a clearer idea how important that is. (I know that\n&gt;  &gt; day is approaching!)\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks for the vote of confidence :-)\n\nYou&#39;re welcome. I see the flurry of testers being told to use JUnit to \ndo integration testing and retrofit tests to legacy code. There are two \nfundamental differences in how things might proceed once they find out \nJUnit makes testing those code annoying:\n\n1. They&#39;ll recognize that their design has something to do with it and \nstart refactoring towards more testability.\n\n2. They&#39;ll be pointed at TestNG, which makes it much easier to deal with \nthose design issues while they decide when to do #1.\n\nI&#39;m really glad that the community has a clear alternative to JUnit, and \none designed to augment it without necessarily trying to drive it out. \nCommendable.\n\n&gt;  &gt; You could say that marker annotations are &quot;merely&quot; syntax\n&gt;  &gt; sugar replacing marker interfaces. That said, syntax sugar\n&gt;  &gt; done well is very nice. Also, annotations were /designed/ for\n&gt;  &gt; this kind of thing, and interfaces weren&#39;t. Interfaces are\n&gt;  &gt; not metadata, even if they can be metadata. My butter knife\n&gt;  &gt; can be a screwdriver, but that doesn&#39;t mean I should avoid\n&gt;  &gt; buying a screwdriver.\n&gt; \n&gt; Well put.\n\nOccasionally I do hit upon something. :)\n-- \nJ.
