I will post the<br/>\nworking copy.  My current copy has gone through a lot of refactoring, but<br/>\nisn&#39;t finished.  The copy I post will not have any separation of<br/>\nmodel/view/controller since it was never meant to be distributed (it was a<br/>\ntwo day proof-of-concept).  However, that being said, this is the copy that<br/>\nwe have been using for three months.  I will also include a readme for<br/>\ngetting this installed in VAJ.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Jason<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">     &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n    &gt; From: Mathieu Gervais [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:egoine_@...\">egoine_@...</a>]<br/>\n    &gt; Sent: Tuesday, June 12, 2001 8:42 AM<br/>\n    &gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n    &gt; Subject: Re:VAJ metric utility (was: [junit] Best <br/>\n    &gt; Practice for Tests ?)<br/>\n    &gt; <br/>\n    &gt; <br/>\n    &gt; From: Jason Rogers<br/>\n    &gt; [...]<br/>\n    &gt; &gt;Well put!  This is something I have often alluded to in <br/>\n    &gt; my own company, but<br/>\n    &gt; &gt;still eludes me frequently.  For that reason I wrote a <br/>\n    &gt; utility that<br/>\n    &gt; &gt;integrates with VAJ to keep the metrics coming as far as <br/>\n    &gt; what is tested and<br/>\n    &gt; &gt;what is not.  This is not a code coverage analysis; all <br/>\n    &gt; it does is report<br/>\n    &gt; on<br/>\n    &gt; &gt;which classes are tested and which are not, and of the <br/>\n    &gt; ones that are - how<br/>\n    &gt; &gt;much of their public interface is tested.<br/>\n    &gt; <br/>\n    &gt; Would you be willing to publish such an utility. I think <br/>\n    &gt; it might be usefull<br/>\n    &gt; to the community. (At least I know _I_ wanted to write <br/>\n    &gt; something that list<br/>\n    &gt; which class has a TestClass written for and which don&#39;t). <br/>\n    &gt; Your stuff looks<br/>\n    &gt; cool.<br/>\n    &gt; <br/>\n    &gt; mathieu<br/>\n    &gt; <br/>\n    &gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:<br/>\n    &gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\">junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n    &gt;  <br/>\n    &gt; <br/>\n    &gt; Your use of Yahoo!
