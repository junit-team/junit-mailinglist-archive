Lots of people want to \ncontribute to JUnit. Some people have done significant work. JXUnit \nwent so far as forking, and Vladimir Bossicard is obviously getting \nfrustrated (not that I blame him).\n\n1. Erich and I are doing this on really limited resources, and nobody \nhas ever said, &quot;How can I help?&quot; except Erik Meade. Coming to us with \nan offer to make some problem go away is much more likely to get a \npositive response than, &quot;Here&#39;s some code. Integrate it.&quot;\n\n2. JUnit as a political gesture celebrates the ability of programmers \nto test their own software. The code and tests must be held to a \nhigher standard, to demonstrate the techniques necessary to uphold \nour end of the bargain.\n\n3. We are new to the open source culture, and we are certain to make \nsome mistakes. When we do, we need feedback.\n\n4. We don&#39;t get to program much, and when we do it is generally in a \nvery constrainted situation where we have to make lots of \ncompromises. Our greatest joy in JUnit is a project where we can \nengineer at the limits of our ability.\n\nOur long-term goal is to shift primary responsibility for the further \ndevelopment of JUnit to the community, while retaining the technical \nexcellence exhibited by junit.framework, extending that level of \nrefinement to the rest of the codebase, and maintaining our ability \nto get together for a couple of days and add cool features.\n\nImmediately, expect any submissions that don&#39;t come with extensive \ntest cases to be unceremoniously bounced. Offers of help with grunge \nwork will be gratefully accepted.\n\nKent\n\n\n\n\n",
