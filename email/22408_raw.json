Now I&#39;m not entirely sure\nwhere the semantics of clas=\r\nses/methods/both are documented, but you are right;\n\nclasses starts each cl=\r\nass in a thread of its own, methods runs all the methods of each class in i=\r\nts own thread. &quot;both&quot; is actually the \nvaguest of the two, but it does both=\r\n ;)\n\nJunit 4.7+ itself comes with what I like to think of as a reference im=\r\nplemention of a parallel computer. As can be seen by this issue \n(http://gi=\r\nthub.com/KentBeck/junit/issues#issue/18), there are some\nknown gotchas to t=\r\nhis implementation.\n\n\nSurefire knows how to use both ParallelComputer (juni=\r\nt) and ConfigurableParallelComputer (mine). Check blog post at http://incod=\r\newetrustinc.blogspot.com/2010/01/run-your-junit-tests-concurrently-with.htm=\r\nl\n\n\nI have actually created several revisions of ConfigurableParallelComput=\r\ner since last time dsaff looked at it, and in its current incarnation it&#39;s =\r\nmuch more similar to ParallelComputer but without the gotchas. \nI am hererb=\r\ny --&gt; . &lt;--- requesting ConfigurableParallelComputer and its test-cases to =\r\nbe accepted as  a submission to junit\nas a patch for issue 18. Being the or=\r\niginal author of all, I&#39;ll grant the CPL lisence.\n\nI will try to update the=\r\n surefire docs somewhat, it&#39;s on my todo\nlist. But it seems like most of yo=\r\nur question actually should be \nanswered somewhere in junit.\n\nKristian\n\n\n--=\r\n- In junit@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Douglas Ferguson&quot; &lt;douglas@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Can=\r\n anybody shed light on this comment from the docs?\n&gt; \n&gt; ......\n&gt; \n&gt; paralle=\r\nl \t\n&gt; \n&gt; String \t2.2 \t(TestNG only) When you use the parallel attribute, Te=\r\nstNG will try to run all your test methods in separate threads, except for =\r\nmethods      that depend on each other, which will be run in the same threa=\r\nd in order to respect their order of execution.\n&gt; \n&gt;  In JUnit 4.7 the valu=\r\nes are classes/methods/both to run in separate threads, as controlled by th=\r\nreadCount.\n&gt; \n&gt; .....\n&gt; \n&gt; I have junit test tests and when I set parallel =\r\n=3D methods it runs everything synchronously, however when I set parallel =\r\n=3D classes, it runs the classes in parallel. I haven&#39;t been able to find g=\r\nood documentation for this anywhere.. Does anybody know of any good resourc=\r\nes? \n&gt; \n&gt; Also, assuming I can get methods to work, does it run all methods=\r\n in parallel or does it run the methods in parallel by class? i.e. 1 class =\r\nat a time but all the methods in that class are parallel?\n&gt; \n&gt; Are there ot=\r\nher gotchas or configuration settings I should be considering? I.E. I&#39;ve re=\r\nad a little bit on ConfigurableParallelComputer but I&#39;m not sure what it&#39;s =\r\nall about..\n&gt;\n\n\n\n",
