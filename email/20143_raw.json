Bumblebee is a small framework that\nallows you to create documentation from executing code, at the moment\nfrom JUnit 4.4 tests. If you spend a lot of time creating snippet\nintense documentation for e.g. API&#39;s, this might be the thing for you.\n\nAt\nhttp://www.agical.com/bumblebee/bumblebee_doc.html\nyou can see the generated doc for the latest release, and at\nhttp://www.agical.com/bumblebee/download/bumblebee-0.3-dist.zip\nyou can download the whole thing, with sources, dependencies and more.\n\nThe theme for this release was to add functions for getting contents\nfrom various sources to include in the output.That boiled down to\ngetting Bumblebee out of the way of Ruby and remove some of the\nfeature envy encountered.\nThe outcome is a more consequent syntax, with better Ruby integration\nand better extensibility.\nMaven2 was also thrown out as build system in favor of Buildr.\nHopefully the maven2 related stuff such as repositories will still\nwork as before.\n\nFeel free to download and try it out! I&#39;d really appreciate all sorts\nof feedback, and I&#39;d be happy to help you out if you have any trouble\nwith it.\n\nIf you could hint me for other places/lists where this kind of tool\nwould be appreciated, please drop me a line.\n\nCheers\nDaniel\n\n-- \n__________________________\nDaniel.Brolund@...\n\n",
