When I make design decisions, I\nnotate them as part of my tests. Since in my style of development I iterate\nbetween design, implement, and test several times a minute, I don&#39;t think\nI&#39;d like separate tools. I use the feedback from the results of each\nactivity to improve my decisions in the other activities.\n \nWhat I can see clearly is the need to be able to view and manipulate the\nspecification/design/tests in different ways to suit different purposes. For\nexample, you can translate a test or set of tests into a sequence diagram.\nSometimes I would like to see a summary of the design implications of my\ntests in this or some other graphical format.\n \nRegards,\n \nKent Beck\nThree Rivers Institute\n\n  _____  \n\nFrom: junit@yahoogroups.com [mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com] On Behalf Of J.\nB.

I expected to talk a little about Theories and\n&gt; assertThat, but we ended up having a wide-ranging discussion about a\nvariety\n&gt; of topics. I mind-mapped the result and put in on the conference wiki:\n&gt; \n&gt; http://www.agileope\n&lt;http://www.agileopennorthwest.com/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?FutureOfUnitTesting&gt;\nnnorthwest.com/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?FutureOfUnitTesting \n&gt; &lt;http://www.agileope\n&lt;http://www.agileopennorthwest.com/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?FutureOfUnitTesting&gt;\nnnorthwest.com/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?FutureOfUnitTesting&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; The most surprising result to me was the interest in language features for\n&gt; testing-what would a language look like that included double-checking as a\n&gt; first-class concept? I was also surprised at how much commonality there\nwas\n&gt; between the unit and functional testing &quot;vendors&quot;, that reporting is a big\n&gt; issue for everyone.\n&gt; \n&gt; One thing missing from the discussion was much talk about the hopes and\n&gt; dreams of users, so I thought I would open up the question here. What is\nit\n&gt; you wish your testing tool would do for you that it doesn&#39;t?\n\nI&#39;m beginning to wonder whether we should have separate design and \ntesting tools. This seems to be a serious source of contention among \nprogrammers: we call it testing, but we mean design, and when we do \ndesign, testing is a secondary consideration, and yet testing is important.\n\nRather than repackaging TDD and calling it BDD, hoping that Sapir-Whorf \nwill save us from our own sloppiness, maybe it&#39;s time for separate tools \nfor design and testing. I have no idea how that would work, but perhaps \nit would help us all get along.\n\nSo I&#39;d like a way to separate my design and testing activities when I do \nTDD. For example, when I test-drive behavior that doesn&#39;t yet exist, I&#39;m \nalmost always designing; but when I fill in the holes by adding a test \nfor a case that should already pass, I&#39;m testing. Perhaps it would be \nbetter to separate those somehow.\n\nAny ideas?\n-- \nJ. B.
