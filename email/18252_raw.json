From the point where I submit my tests, I know that no m=\r\natter what\n&gt;  code gets checked in after me, the functionality of the syste=\r\nm will not\n&gt;  decrease.\n&gt;\n&gt;  Tests also help a great deal make my code more=\r\n robust.\n&gt;\nI said that the main benifit of TDD is to guide the design, I di=\r\ndn&#39;t\nsay that it is the only benefit. I don&#39;t know if it would be worth\nwri=\r\nting unit tests to the extent we do if it &quot;just&quot; shows that things\nwork and=\r\n to have a regression suite. Maybe I would suffice with\nfunctional tests th=\r\nen. Who knows?\nRemember that TDD is not only about writing the tests, it is=\r\n also\nabout refactoring and daring to do that. So by having the benefits\nth=\r\nat you speak about that is exacly what you get, courge to change\nthings (ri=\r\nght?) and of course examples to help understanding the\nclasses they test.\n\n=\r\nTDD is not only unit tests either, it is also acceptancetests and\nintegrati=\r\nontests so not all aspects of TDD occurs on the unit-level\nand TDD.\n\n&gt;  But=\r\n drive my design with tests? That&#39;s dangerous and can potentially lead to\n&gt;=\r\n  micro-design, i.e. design without seeing the big picture (&quot;I&#39;ll use this\n=\r\n&gt;  signature because the test looks cleaner then&quot;).\n&gt;\n\nI think that the mic=\r\nro design is also important. Going to and from\nthere you often find that th=\r\ne larger problems resemble the micro\nproblems or that the larger problems a=\r\nre easier to solve when you have\na good understanding of the micro problems=\r\n.\nWhen microdesigning you&#39;re doing that for a reason, it has to fit\nsomewhe=\r\nre in the big picture. I haven&#39;t really experienced designing\nwithout seing=\r\n the big picture. I tend to look at the big picture in\nterms of smaller pro=\r\nblems that have to be solved in order to get where\nI want to go. When I sol=\r\nved one small problem I take a look again at\nthe big picture to decide wher=\r\ne to go next. Not that seldomly with the\nnew knowledge I&#39;ve aquired I see t=\r\nhings about the big pictire that I\ndidn&#39;t see before and how the big pictur=\r\ne shrinks with my newly won\nvocabulary (It is funny how big problems can bo=\r\nil down to much fewer\nabstractions than you first thought once you start pu=\r\ntting your teeth\nin it, isnt it?)\n\nIt is not forbidden to go to a whitebora=\r\nd, sketch down UML-diagrams on\na napkin while doing TDD either.\n\nDoes that =\r\nmake any sense at all?\n\n",
