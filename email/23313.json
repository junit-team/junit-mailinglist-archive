TestRule is a distillation of a subset of MethodRule.<br/>\nThat subset of MethodRule has already had dozens of uses in open<br/>\nsource code accessible to Google Code Search, without need for<br/>\nenhancement.  I consider TestRule a fairly well-tested API addition.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m looking forward to releasing 4.9 with TestRule as currently<br/>\nspecified, and then, in the 4.10 cycle, figuring out new extension<br/>\npoints that will have a similar bang-for-buck.  See, for example,<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://github.com/KentBeck/junit/issues/199,\">https://github.com/KentBeck/junit/issues/199,</a> which is heavily<br/>\ninfluenced by some of your feature suggestions.  I&#39;m hoping it will go<br/>\na long way toward solving the Spring extensibility problem among many<br/>\nothers.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s been over a year since 4.8.  I don&#39;t intend for 4.9 to spend<br/>\nnearly as long as the most recent feature release.<br/>\n<br/>\n   David Saff<br/>\n<br/>\nOn Sat, Mar 5, 2011 at 3:59 AM, Neale Upstone<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:neale.upstone@...\">neale.upstone@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; David,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; There is a problem in parking feature requests for 4.9 in that 4.9 is a<br/>\n&gt; feature release and introduces API changes e.g. TestRule, which are<br/>\n&gt; subject to debate over API (e.g. the desire from the Spring point of<br/>\n&gt; view to have Object target in there to allow us to replace<br/>\n&gt; SpringJUnit4ClassRunner with a Rule).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; If TestRule is released as is in 4.9, then it&#39;s setting a very<br/>\n&gt; constrained direction which will be difficult to change in 4.10.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; On 04/03/2011 18:35, David Saff wrote:<br/>\n&gt;&gt; All,<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Over the last week or so, I&#39;ve triaged almost 200 JUnit issues that<br/>\n&gt;&gt; have accumulated over the last year, closing about 80 truly invalid<br/>\n&gt;&gt; issues that were fixed, duplicates, or no longer made sense. I tagged<br/>\n&gt;&gt; the rest with:<br/>\n&gt;&gt; - regression bugs (9): there was an implementation of the feature that<br/>\n&gt;&gt; worked prior to the 4.9 beta (although potentially earlier than<br/>\n&gt;&gt; 4.8.x))<br/>\n&gt;&gt; - nonregression bugs (15): it is likely the feature has always failed<br/>\n&gt;&gt; in the documented way.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; - features (~95): additions to the (implicit) spec, with<br/>\n&gt;&gt; implementations to provide the additions.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Thanks to everyone who has been submitting problems, proposals, and<br/>\n&gt;&gt; patches.  I&#39;m sorry that some of you have been waiting so long for a<br/>\n&gt;&gt; response.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; The next part of the development plan, in order:<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; - Fix the regression bugs<br/>\n&gt;&gt; - Release a 4.9 beta 3<br/>\n&gt;&gt; - Hopefully 4.9b3 can become the final release.  (I am not planning<br/>\n&gt;&gt; any nonregression bug fixes or new features to get into the 4.9<br/>\n&gt;&gt; release.  We need to steer this ship back toward frequent releases.)<br/>\n&gt;&gt; - Create a github project for junit.contrib.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; - Go through the backlog of pull requests, to see which can be<br/>\n&gt;&gt; accepted as is, and which either need changes, or should be redirected<br/>\n&gt;&gt; into junit.contrib.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; - Work through non-regression bugs for further releases in the 4.9.x series<br/>\n&gt;&gt; - Choose a number of highly-rated feature requests to be the scope for<br/>\n&gt;&gt; 4.10, and begin (patch acceptance / implementation)<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; I&#39;m excited to see this project keep moving forward,<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;     David Saff<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; ------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Yahoo!
