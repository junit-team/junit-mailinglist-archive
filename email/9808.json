If every instance of a class is the same, then there is <br/>\nnot much point in distinguishing between object and class, except if <br/>\nyou&#39;re talking to a compiler. As you doubtless know, one commonly says <br/>\nthat a collection has a property if all its elements have that property. <br/>\nIt&#39;s just a kind of verbal shorthand.<br/>\n<br/>\nThus, the TestCase subclass is, in effect, the fixture: all <br/>\nfreshly-initialized instances of that class (as in, after invoking <br/>\nsetUp) represent the same fixture state.<br/>\n<br/>\nDoes that statement compile? No. But then we&#39;re not compilers. :)<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJ. B.
