BUT in some cases this solution can be a desirable one. Therefore I=\r\n think this solution, along with others (see below) should be provided.\n&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n My current need for global rules is:\n&gt; - I am developing a Swing console, =\r\ncalled TestUI, that will allow you to visually see the results of your test=\r\ns, the tests that failed and those that succeeded. You will also be able to=\r\n specify a path to watch for Surefire reports, therefore combining analytic=\r\nal functions with report functions (the report functions are those for whic=\r\nh I need global rules).\n&gt;\n&gt; @David: I took a look at RunListener, and indee=\r\nd it solves my problem (just like a TestWatchman-derived rule would), excep=\r\nt that it is very inconvenient to use. For example, at work I have 110 modu=\r\nles, and a total number of 800 unit tests. I would like to globally hook up=\r\n my TestUIAgentRule, to report to my TestUI console each test that is execu=\r\nted.\n&gt;\n&gt; I execute the tests from Eclipse or from Maven, during build sessi=\r\nons. Therefore I cannot use RunListener or a Rule for this. I need some glo=\r\nbal mechanism to enable a Rule for all the executed tests.\n&gt;\n&gt; Except for J=\r\nVM params, here is another idea: having a junit properties/XML configuratio=\r\nn file. It has been suggested on this message group that junit should have =\r\na configuration file, and I am PRO this solution.\n&gt;\n&gt; In such a config file=\r\n (available soomewhere in the classpath, like the log4j.properties), we cou=\r\nld specifiy:\n&gt; - which tests to execute/exclude/ignore\n&gt; - global rules\n&gt; -=\r\n test suites to run/exclude\n&gt; - categories to run/exclude\n&gt;\n&gt; This could al=\r\nso solve this problem: http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/junit/message/221=\r\n84. The request here (read the first post in the thread) asks for a GUI whe=\r\nre unit tests could be disabled, like light bulbs (PS: my TestUI console wi=\r\nll be able to do this, sometime in the\n&gt; future releases).\n&gt;\n&gt; What do you =\r\nthink of this?\n&gt;\n&gt; Cheers,\n&gt; Bogdan\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In junit@yahoogroups.com, Joaki=\r\nm Ohlrogge &lt;joakim.ohlrogge@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Hi Bogdan,\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I can see wh=\r\nere you&#39;re coming from with system properties to solve this.\n&gt;&gt; I would muc=\r\nh rather have some way of solving this where you would not have\n&gt;&gt; to rely =\r\non a property being set at the JVM-level. The reason is that it&#39;s\n&gt;&gt; very i=\r\nnconvenient to have to set run parameters if you just want to rerun a\n&gt;&gt; si=\r\nngle test (in eclipse that&#39;s a run configuration rather than just\n&gt;&gt; rightc=\r\nlicking on a test in the runner). If JUnit instead would look for a\n&gt;&gt; stan=\r\ndard property-file or similar (like junit-rules.properties in the root\n&gt;&gt; o=\r\nf your class-path and merge all found resources found like\n&gt;&gt; getClass().ge=\r\ntClassLoader().getResources(&quot;/junit-rules.properties&quot;) then it\n&gt;&gt; would jus=\r\nt work with no external configuration like launch parameters or\n&gt;&gt; script p=\r\narameters.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; With VM-parameters I don&#39;t see that the feature would be u=\r\nseful for anything\n&gt;&gt; that influences the testrun, just for collecting info=\r\nrmation about the run.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; -------------------------------------------=\r\n----------\n&gt;&gt; Joakim Ohlrogge\n&gt;&gt; Agical AB\n&gt;&gt; V=E4sterl=E5nggatan 79, 2 tr\n=\r\n&gt;&gt; 111 29 Stockholm, SWEDEN\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Mobile: +46-708-754004\n&gt;&gt; Blog: johlrogge=\r\n.wordpress.com\n&gt;&gt; E-mail: joakim.ohlrogge@...\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; On Sat, Dec 5, 2009 =\r\nat 8:46 PM, Bogdan &lt;\n&gt;&gt; bogdan.mocanu.notifications@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Hi guys,\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; thank you very much for your responses.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n I didn&#39;t know about the RunListener, so I will definitely take a look at\n&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; it, and come back with an answer regarding it.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; What I was thi=\r\nnking about the global rules is to be able to configure\n&gt;&gt; &gt; something like=\r\n global rules, that are specified as a startup parameter (read\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Java op=\r\ntion) when starting the test (in the project at my office, we have\n&gt;&gt; &gt; lik=\r\ne 750 tests, and therefore would work just nice to configure this option\n&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; just for my env; probably the RunListener will work just like that, so a=\r\ns I\n&gt;&gt; &gt; said, I will read about this).\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; I was thinking about some=\r\nthing like this:\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; java\n&gt;&gt; &gt; -Djunit.globalRules=3Dcom.test.myrules=\r\n.SomeNiceRule,com.test.myrules.SomeNiceRule2\n&gt;&gt; &gt; ..........\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Chee=\r\nrs,\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Bogdan\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; --- In junit@yahoogroups.com &lt;junit%40yahoog=\r\nroups.com&gt;, &quot;Bogdan&quot;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;bogdan.mocanu.notifications@&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; Hi everyone,\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; as we have it currently, we can place a Rule =\r\nin a test, and that rule\n&gt;&gt; &gt; will be activated for that test. To have the =\r\nrule working in several tests,\n&gt;&gt; &gt; you have to place the Rule in each test=\r\n.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; However, I am searching for a way to activate a Rule for al=\r\nl the tests\n&gt;&gt; &gt; that are executed, without needing to add the rule to each=\r\n test. Perhaps by\n&gt;&gt; &gt; specifying a Java property parameter when running th=\r\ne tests (I could also\n&gt;&gt; &gt; set this as a global Java option, therefore bein=\r\ng used upon each execution\n&gt;&gt; &gt; of the JVM).\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Do you know if t=\r\nhis is possible?\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; The reason why I need this, is: I am making =\r\nthe plans and gathering the\n&gt;&gt; &gt; ideas for creating a simple Swing applicat=\r\nion that will display the results\n&gt;&gt; &gt; of the executed tests (just like the=\r\n JUnit view in Eclipse/Idea/Netbeans,\n&gt;&gt; &gt; but perhaps with more details, a=\r\nnd also available for anyone, not just IDE\n&gt;&gt; &gt; users). Currently I develop=\r\ned a small agent rule, that you can place in your\n&gt;&gt; &gt; test, and it will re=\r\nport to the console the status of your tests (the Swing\n&gt;&gt; &gt; console runs r=\r\nemotely).\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; This is ok, but it means that you will have to add =\r\nthis rule to each and\n&gt;&gt; &gt; every test that you have. It also means that wil=\r\nl not be an easy task to\n&gt;&gt; &gt; disable this rule, if you don&#39;t want it anymo=\r\nre.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Therefore a possibility to enable Rules globally for all =\r\ntests I think is\n&gt;&gt; &gt; the best solution for my case, and also a good tool t=\r\no have for various\n&gt;&gt; &gt; other tasks.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; What do you think? Also,=\r\n what do you think about the Swing console idea?\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Cheers,\n&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; Bogdan\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; [Non-text portions of this message=\r\n have been removed]\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Y=\r\nahoo!
