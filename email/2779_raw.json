This is much more tricky, but is possible and I&#39;ve\n&gt; played with the idea some. Most browsers have an (undocumented) mechanism\n&gt; whereby you can access their virtual machine without actually loading the\n&gt; browser.\n\nIf you are using Internet Explorer on windows, you can create a COM\ninterface to an instance and tell it to load a web page. Sort of like\nremote-controlling explorer. You can put javascript in your HTML page\nthat can call java methods in your applet to run the tests. You can\nalso create a second applet that can call methods in the applet under\ntest because they all live in the same address space.\n\nI think you can use a command line option to tell Netscape which page\nto load. I know this feature is available on unix.\n\nThis way, it should be very similar to actually running the stuff manually.\nWhat I mean is that this will emulate the live environment as much as\npossible.  However, I am unsure of how to automate the GUI interaction part.\nThere are some tricky threading issues involved. I think JFCUnit addresses\nthese issues for swing -- but unfortunately I am using AWT so I cannot\nbe of much help at the moment.\n\n-- \nChester Kustarz 2\nhttp://www.monkey.org/~chester\n\n\n",
