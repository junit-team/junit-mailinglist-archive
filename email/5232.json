More to the point it is not economically viable<br/>\nto write and maintain the recovery code.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf an exception is caused by a<br/>\nsoftware error I just want the stacktrace to be logged. Forcing <br/>\ndevelopers to write catch clauses for checked exceptions increases <br/>\nthe possiblity they will lose that original stacktrace.<br/>\n<br/>\nHave you not been in the position of debugging a stacktrace to find<br/>\nthat it was just a rethrow of another exception which has now been<br/>\nlost?<br/>\n<br/>\nMy preference would be to use unchecked exceptions everywhere and<br/>\nmaybe use checked exceptions (refactor from unchecked to checked)<br/>\nwhere I will explicitely try to do some recovery.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nNeil Swingler<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;If they don&#39;t have to write any exception handling code they can&#39;t <br/>\n&gt; &gt;code errors into it. The exceptions can propogate to a single<br/>\n&gt; &gt;point to be logged.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; How do you effectively handle all exceptions when they bubble up to <br/>\n </span></blockquote>a <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; single common point?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; It seems to me the best you can do is log them and attempt to <br/>\n </span></blockquote>perform <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; some generic action like exiting.  Without the original context of <br/>\n </span></blockquote>the <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; exception, it may be difficult to take any intelligent corrective <br/>\n&gt; action.  Handling an exception closer to its point of origin is <br/>\n&gt; generally easier and less detrimental to the system.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; That said, I&#39;d agree that if all exceptions bubble to the top then <br/>\n </span></blockquote>the <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; use of unchecked exceptions eases maintenance.
