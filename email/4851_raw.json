In white box testing, you\n&gt; know how it works, so you can test based on knowing that different inputs\n&gt; get processing differently.\n\nYes, that is part of the difference.  Like I said it was a _quick_\nsummary.\n\n&gt; \n&gt; For example, for some index class, if you know it uses a linear list up\n&gt; to 5 items and then a hash table, choosing to test with 4 items to test\n&gt; the list case and also test with 5 items to test the hash table case is\n&gt; white box testing.\n\nYes.  That is an example of whitebox testing.\n\n------------------------------\n\nMy viewpoint:\n\nI focus on component development.  Components differ from objects in two\nkey areas: they live in a container, and all their contracts are\nspecified by an interface.  The container controls how they live and\ndie, and which implementation of the component is used.  Quick\nanalogy:\n\nImagine buying a radio.  We all know how a radio works.  It&#39;s interface\nis the same no matter where you go--you have a control to change the\nstation and a control to change the volume.  There are several models\nof the radio, and in a store, there are many instances of each model.\n\nThe Component is the radio.  It is composed of an interface (separate\nfrom the actual implementation of the component), and its implementation\n(the model of radio).  A container picks which model to give you,\ncreates the instance, and lets you use it.\n\nYou can only really do black box testing in this type of environment.\nYou have the advantage of knowing what the component does.  You don&#39;t\nknow how it does it--and from the perspective of using the component\nyou don&#39;t care.\n\nI have created a test harness using JUnit for my components, so that I\ncan test several component types with one TestCase.  It&#39;s a beautiful\nthing.\n\nNow, If I tried to write a white-box test on my component, I run into\nsome serious setbacks.  That white-box (or micro test) is tied to the\ncomponent implementation.  I cannot reuse that test on another\nimplementation of the same component interface.  That is a serious\ndrawback to me.\n\n--------------------------------\n\nDifferent tools for different fools:\n\nJUnit is designed for blackbox testing.  That is how it should be used.\nThe new JDK 1.4 assertion facilities are for whitebox testing.  That is\nhow they should be used.\n\n\n-- \n\n&quot;They that give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary safety\n  deserve neither liberty nor safety.&quot;\n                 - Benjamin Franklin\n\n\n",
