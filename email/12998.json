Wrap it in a class that you can <br/>\nmanipulate in your tests.<br/>\n<br/>\nKevin<br/>\n<br/>\nhaefeleuser wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; For my JUnit tests I need to modify the system time.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Instead of doing this manually by changing the OS clock I would like<br/>\n&gt; to change the clock programatically in Java.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Of course I can set the time on the Calendar object in the JUnit test.<br/>\n&gt; But it has no effect on the tested class. In the tested class &quot;new<br/>\n&gt; Date() &quot; returns always the current date and not the one which I set<br/>\n&gt; in my JUnit test.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I have test data for business logic which I create before the test<br/>\n&gt; starts and which contain absolute dates like 2004-12-31. So I need to<br/>\n&gt; modify the system date for my tests.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; What I need to test is calculation of the average sold quantity. But<br/>\n&gt; only the last X weeks (from today) need to be considered. My test<br/>\n&gt; sales data contains dates like 2004-12-31. Its much easier for me to<br/>\n&gt; write and understand data with such &quot;absolute&quot; dates instead of<br/>\n&gt; relative dates (by rolling the dates around and not understanding it<br/>\n&gt; quickly). So it would be good for me to simply set the system date<br/>\n&gt; before the test starts and thus use absolute dates for my tests<br/>\n&gt; instead of relative ones.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Of course I could make the dates of the test data relative, but that<br/>\n&gt; would be harder to code, understand and to maintain. It better for me<br/>\n&gt; to change the system time. But it needs to be done programatically in<br/>\n&gt; the JUnit test and not manually by changing the OS date by hand.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Can you provide a solution for that please?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; Yahoo!
