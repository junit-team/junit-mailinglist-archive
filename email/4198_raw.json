I would be a lot more convinced of the use of\n&gt; tests as a sole documentary\n&gt; agent if it were easy to use a tool to automatically\n&gt; jump to the appropriate\n&gt; test for a method from the source code.\n&gt; \n&gt; Seems to me that tests tend to evolve quite quickly\n&gt; and (maybe it&#39;s just me)\n&gt; haphazardly. One of the reasons I think that JUnit\n&gt; is so useful is that it\n&gt; is very light-weight. If its usage was altered to\n&gt; structure it more, the\n&gt; same problems with syncing with the code would\n&gt; happen as with integrated\n&gt; (javadoc) comments. \n&gt; \n&gt; Just my tuppence worth.\n&gt; \n&gt;  -----Original Message-----\n&gt; From: \tMike Clark [mailto:mike@...] \n&gt; Sent:\t22 February 2002 15:26\n&gt; To:\tjunit@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Subject:\tRe: [junit] Re: JavaDocs\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Heath, Joseph&quot; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Then I&#39;ll leave you with this final thought:  If\n&gt; we design\n&gt; &gt; &gt; software by writing tests first, do the tests\n&gt; document the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; intention of the software, or its\n&gt; implementation?\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; But this assumes that our tests cover all\n&gt; possibilities of use, which can\n&gt; &gt; result in large test suites. I am not against this\n&gt; (in fact I prefer it),\n&gt; &gt; but often a few words of English (or whatever\n&gt; language you read) is\n&gt; &gt; preferrable (IMHO) to a large test suite.\n&gt; &gt; I still have the test suite, however, for\n&gt; refactoring and code proof.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; If we don&#39;t write new code until we have a failing\n&gt; test, then the tests\n&gt; cover all the methods.  I agree that they may not\n&gt; test all possible\n&gt; parameters.  We&#39;ll maximize the testing investment\n&gt; by testing interesting\n&gt; boundary conditions and reasonable ranges for\n&gt; parameters.  Our code coverage\n&gt; will still be very high.  And yes, we&#39;ll amass test\n&gt; suites quickly as our\n&gt; tests become more comprehensive over time.\n&gt; \n&gt; If a few words of English is necessary over and\n&gt; above the method signature,\n&gt; then by all means add it to the documentation.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I would still say that that the tests document\n&gt; examples of the intention,\n&gt; &gt; rather than the intention itself. These examples\n&gt; may be a complete set or\n&gt; &gt; may not be, often just the critical subset.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Agreed.  Examples of intention and intention draw\n&gt; closer together the more\n&gt; we use test-first design.  Nevertheless, we&#39;re\n&gt; documenting intention rather\n&gt; than implementation.\n&gt; \n&gt; Good points - thanks!\n&gt; \n&gt; Mike\n&gt; \n&gt; --\n&gt; Mike Clark\n&gt; Clarkware Consulting, Inc.\n&gt; http://www.clarkware.com\n&gt; 720.851.2014\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
