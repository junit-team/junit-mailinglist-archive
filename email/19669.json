If I<br/>\n&gt; can, it makes sense to avoid the singleton. The enforcement that<br/>\n&gt; singleton brings is the solution to a problem, but the problem is social<br/>\n&gt; not technical. It pays to know whether you have the problem or not.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>In short, no, I do not trust the team members. Nor do I trust the JVM.<br/>\n<br/>\nTeams are rarely made of just smart, dedicated, senior people. And even <br/>\nthe best make mistakes, see Murphy&#39;s Law. So the good engineering <br/>\nresponse to Murphy, who was a real engineer, is to reduce the chance <br/>\nthat folks can do things wrong. Even when the team is only me, I&#39;m not <br/>\nsure it is wise to &#39;trust the team&#39;<br/>\n<br/>\nWith the current style to WebApps, with J2EE using multiple class <br/>\nloaders, its not clear that even when done &quot;right&quot; that the singleton <br/>\npattern is feasible.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I&#39;m taking from this thread is:<br/>\n1) statements that &quot;singletons are evil&quot; is overly generalized<br/>\n2) sometimes singletons are very useful and even critical.<br/>\n3) many solutions are as bad as the problem<br/>\n4) testing singletons in general, and with Junit in particular, is a <br/>\nPITA if not impossible.<br/>\n5) many alternatives exist for the lazy &quot;global variable&quot; design, such <br/>\nas Context, XML files, etc.<br/>\n6) no good alternative exists if you really, really want one and only <br/>\none instance of an object. And you may not be able to do it anyway.<br/>\n<br/>\nPat<br/>\n-- <br/>\nPat Farrell<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.pfarrell.com/\">http://www.pfarrell.com/</a></div>",
