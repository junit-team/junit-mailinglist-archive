This will be posted now and then; not often<br/>\nenough to be spam, but often enough to keep our newer members aware of<br/>\nhow we conduct business around here.<br/>\n<br/>\nDear members and readers of the JUnit mailing list,<br/>\n<br/>\nAround here, we love testing. Not only do we love testing, we love to<br/>\ndiscuss any and all aspects of testing, often with enthusiasm and<br/>\npassion. This is good, This is the reason that this mailing list<br/>\nexists. On top of all this, we are very keen to help others understand<br/>\nthis strange affliction we have; medical name &quot;testus infectus&quot;,<br/>\nbetter known as being test infected. We love to answer questions and<br/>\nhelp those new to the joy move further down the road towards test<br/>\nenlightenment. In the classic spirit of hospitality, our list is your<br/>\nlist, our test cases are your test cases. Please make yourself at home<br/>\nand enjoy the journey. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nThat said, there are some things that we don&#39;t love, so sit tight and listen up.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe don&#39;t love people who haven&#39;t, or won&#39;t, read the JUnit Frequently<br/>\nAsked Questions (FAQ) document, lovingly maintained by Mike Clark or<br/>\nthe &quot;Smart Questions&quot; document written and maintained by Eric S.<br/>\nRaymond. Here are the links, go forth and read ...<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://junit.sourceforge.net/doc/faq/faq.htm\">http://junit.sourceforge.net/doc/faq/faq.htm</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html\">http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\nWe don&#39;t love people who think that we&#39;ll do their homework<br/>\nassignments for them. Back when I was a lad, we didn&#39;t have the<br/>\nInternet and we had to do our own homework assignments without the aid<br/>\nof all the knowledge and information that you have available to you<br/>\ntoday. (And yes, now that you ask, I did walk uphill both ways to<br/>\nschool through the snow.)<br/>\n<br/>\nWe don&#39;t love people who are incapable of using a search engine, but<br/>\nare yet somehow capable of signing up onto this mailing list so that<br/>\nthey can ask questions that ten seconds of searching would reveal the<br/>\nanswer to. Learn how to use a search engine. Around here, Google seems<br/>\nquite popular. Here&#39;s a link; learn to love it and use it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.google.com/\">http://www.google.com/</a><br/>\n<br/>\nWe don&#39;t love job postings. We do love having jobs (or at least, we<br/>\nlike the pay) and we do like to look at job postings, but we like to<br/>\nlook at them in more logical places like job websites. So, please<br/>\ndon&#39;t be upset when a moderator deletes your carefully worded prose<br/>\ndescribing yet another testing job.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe don&#39;t love thread hijacking. That&#39;s when you start a different<br/>\nsubject by replying to a previous conversation and not even changing<br/>\nthe subject line. We like to discuss a variety of subjects, so please<br/>\nfeel free to be inspired to ask side-questions during ongoing<br/>\nconversations. Just do so by starting a fresh thread with a unique<br/>\nsubject line.<br/>\n<br/>\nLastly, we don&#39;t love people who whine, moan and generally sound like<br/>\npetulant children after they&#39;ve been told that they have violated one<br/>\nof the &quot;laws of the land&quot; around here. It&#39;s a big old Internet; feel<br/>\nfree to take your questions and/or tantrums somewhere else if you<br/>\ndon&#39;t like the way we do things around here.<br/>\n<br/>\nSimon<br/>\n(One of the JUnit mailing list moderators)<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nsimonpeter.org | simonpeter.com | techbook.info</div>",
