B. Rainsberger<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSent: Friday, August 03, 2001 3:42 PM<br/>\nSubject: [junit] Re: False warnings? (Re: re - assert counting)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; &gt;I disagree. Wouldn&#39;t method validate(DataObject) have to either return a<br/>\n&gt; &gt;boolean or perform the assertion itself?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Not at all. The method is designed as &quot;validate this thing, if ok, let it<br/>\n&gt;pass, if not throw a ValidationException).<br/>\n<br/>\nCertainly a fine design. I don&#39;t know why I didn&#39;t think of that at the<br/>\ntime, but...<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Of course, I assume that you prefer not to have an unsuccessful<br/>\n&gt;validation<br/>\n&gt; &gt;register as an error.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Why not? Your code below lacks the stack trace for debugging (A<br/>\n&gt;fail(Throwable) would probably be usefull here). Letting the error go all<br/>\n&gt;the way up to the junit framework let me write even simpler tests.<br/>\n<br/>\nAgreed; however, I find it nice to go on the assumption that a failure means<br/>\nmy code is broken and an error means my test is broken. I wonder if not many<br/>\npeople find this useful or if I&#39;m overstating how useful it can be.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;Yes, a validation error will<br/>\n&gt;show as an error and not a failure in the runner. I personnaly don&#39;t make<br/>\n&gt;any difference between those 2. The unit test passed or it busted. If it&#39;s<br/>\n&gt;an error, it just indicates to me that an exception was thrown (other than<br/>\n&gt;AssertionFailedError) from the test method.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf that works for you, then certainly you&#39;re in good shape. You are doing<br/>\nsomething simple, and until there&#39;s a reason to become more complex, why<br/>\nbother? That&#39;s the attitude. :)<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;I guess we just have a slightly different way of writing tests. Writing<br/>\n&gt;compact tests look like obsfucation to some people while putting lot of<br/>\n&gt;details can look like... obsfucation to some other.  :)<br/>\n<br/>\nAs long as the test communicates, it doesn&#39;t really matter how it<br/>\ncommunicates. Of course, it must communicate *well*.<br/>\n<br/>\nJBR. </span></blockquote></div>",
