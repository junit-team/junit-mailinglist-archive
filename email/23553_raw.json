The test class is checking the \ndependencies and contents of the Maven artifacts produced by the build. \nI have some special build requirements which require me to use Maven \nShade Plugin to bundle external (and in one case also internal) \ndependencies into the same JAR, and these build tests have been \nextremely helpful (more details at the first episodes of \nhttp://www.orfjackal.net/lets-code#jumi).\n\nhttps://github.com/orfjackal/jumi/blob/730378ddf5260cdcb44285c5c75e7a7ca5447407/end-to-end-tests/src/test/java/fi/jumi/test/BuildTest.java\n\nThe first two tests are parameterized. They check each artifact for its \nexpected dependencies and contents.\n\nThe third test is checking one of the artifacts which was checked \nalready earlier, but this time a copy the JAR which which is embedded \ninside another JAR (it&#39;s used in bootstrapping the application). Since \nthis test is slow (~150ms), I want to avoid running it many times. \nLogically it&#39;s related to the things checked by the parameterized tests, \nso I want to keep it close to them, but it itself is not parameterized. \nRight now I&#39;ve solved the issue with a hack, so all but one \nparameterized execution skip the test.\n\nThe fourth and fifth test are tests against all of the parameters. It&#39;s \ntesting the test data, to make sure that some project-wide principles \nare followed (i.e. no visible dependencies to external libraries). These \ntests also are not parameterized. Fortunately they are quick, so I \nhaven&#39;t tried to avoid running them many times.\n\n\nWhat are your suggestions for mixing parameterized and non-parameterized \ntests? Some creative use of nested classes?\n\nI&#39;ve been thinking about extending Parameterized so that I can annotate \nwhich methods are parameterized and which are not, by adding either \n@ParameterizedTest or @NonParameterized annotations to the test methods. \nThe non-parameterized methods would be run only once, probably using the \nfirst element in the test data (passing null to the constructor is \nanother option; now it would fail in the constructor, but I should \nanyways relocate the couple of method calls which are now in the \nconstructor).\n\n-- \nEsko Luontola\nwww.orfjackal.net\n\n",
