It seems all the method names should start with\n&quot;test&quot;. Can the method name be testX, where X can be\nanything? or X necessarily has to be a method of my\nclass being tested.\n\n\nX can be anything. I usually use something like\n\nin the class to be tested:\nString foo(Object in1, Object in2){...}\n\n\nin the test class:\npublic void testFooNormalInputs() {}\npublic void testFooIn1Null() {}\npublic void testFooIn2Null() {}\npublic void testFooBothInputsNull() {}\netc.\n\nSome people combine these into one method. That&#39;s more a matter of style \nthan anything else. (Some of us have it, and some... ;)\n\n\n\n\n2. It is not uncommon that the methods of a class\nrequire a &#39;state&#39; in order for them to be called.\nand coming to this &#39;state&#39; is often not an easy task.\nIs the method setUp meant for this purpose? But\nthen, different methods require a different setup.\nWhat does junit framework suggest on this issue of\nhaving setUps and tearDowns for each method?\n\nsetUp is guaranteed to be called before each and every test, with tearDown \ncalled after. The usual thing I do is set up a test instance of the object \nin setUp, and set it to null in tearDown. (This doesn&#39;t always work, for \nexample in testing singletons.) Further setup to reach the state ready for \ntesting would be done in the test method.\n\nFor example:\npublic class Bar {\n   public Bar(int importantValue) { ... }\n\n   public void setImportantValue(int newValue) { ... }\n   public String foo(Object o1, Object o2) { ... }\n}\n\nin the test class:\n\n   private Bar bar;\n\n   protected void setUp() {\n    bar = new Bar(1);\n   }\n\n   public void testFooNormalValues() {\n     // we know that bar here is clean and fresh:\n     assertEquals(&quot;foo!&quot;, bar.foo(new Object(), new Object()));\n   }\n\n   public void testFooNullValues() {\n     // still fresh here:\n     assertEquals(&quot;Oof!&quot;, bar.foo(null, null));\n   }\n\n   public void testFooNegativeImportantValue() {\n     // fresh, but not as fresh as we want it:\n     bar.setImportantValue(-1);\n     assertEquals(&quot;Oof!&quot;, bar.foo(null, null));\n   }\n\nThe setUp method is more for convenience that anything else: you don&#39;t have \nto type in/cut &#39;n paste the set up code for your test object in all the \ntest methods. There&#39;s nothing to stop you from doing so, however, and in \nsome cases you may need to: for example if you&#39;re testing the constructor.\n\t\n\n\n3. I do not really think I have understood what\njunit is. Is the junit framework a spec? Does this\nreally require a seperate software? I mean, calling\na sequence of methods of a class is not that non-\ntrivial. Can somebody explain to me why I should use\njunit?\n\nJUnit helps to test methods, and the state of the tested object after... \nWhen you have to test a sequence of methods you&#39;re moving into functional \ntesting - though the boundary is by no means clearly defined.\nThat said, to test a sequence of methods:\n1. Test the individual methods\n2. Test the sequence\n3. Test calling the object out of sequence: is it unstable after? Perhaps \nthat indicates that your design is wrong.\n\n\n\n\n\nHTH,\nJim\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
