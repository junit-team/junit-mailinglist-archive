I know of very few developers <br/>\nhere in the UK that are working for companies completely au fait with <br/>\nJSE5, and Mustang is only a month or so around the corner!<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat benefits would converting JUnit 4 to JSE4 bring, beyond flexibility <br/>\nin test naming and ordering?<br/>\n<br/>\nBTW, is there still any development effort intended for JUnit 3.8.x? If <br/>\nso, I&#39;d like to volunteer! :)<br/>\n--<br/>\nStephen Smith, MEng (Wales).<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.stephen-smith.co.uk/\">http://www.stephen-smith.co.uk/</a><br/>\n<br/>\nSimon Chappell wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; On 9/14/06, Robert Wenner &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:robert.wenner@...\">robert.wenner@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;&gt; On Tuesday 12 September 2006 09:30, Mark Levison wrote:<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Unfortunately some of us work in corporate<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; environments where use of Java 1.5 will take at least another couple of<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; years (we only just dropped support for Java 1.3).

At many sites in the US of A, including my current<br/>\n&gt; and several previous ones, will often specify that users not be given<br/>\n&gt; administration rights to their workstations and, further, that the<br/>\n&gt; download and install (in case you get around the lack of admin rights)<br/>\n&gt; of any unauthorised software (and they usually get picky down to the<br/>\n&gt; version numbers) is a dismissible offence. This doesn&#39;t make sense,<br/>\n&gt; applied to developers, but corporate policies are a very real fact of<br/>\n&gt; life for many of us. This is why many of us are not able to switch,<br/>\n&gt; even for non-production and develoment machines.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Simon<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>",
