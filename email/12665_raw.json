Before generating new report,\nwhy not you\n      take copy of the previous report.  In Ant API  contains copy tag\nand move\n      tag. So\n      first step you take a back up using Copy/ Move tag.\n      Second step you clear your old report using delete tag.\n      Third step create report folder again.\n      Finally you generate new report.\n\nAre you saying there&#39;s no extension for JUnit that sends the test\nresults/report into a database, using JDBC or some other mechanism?  I&#39;m\nnew to JUnit, too, but I find it hard to believe that there isn&#39;t\nalready software to store historical test results in a database.\n\n\nTodd.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYahoo!
