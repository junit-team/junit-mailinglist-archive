If it is interesting to know how\nmany test cases the system has passed, then it is also interesting to know how many\nasserts have made it. This is especially true if a test case is something like testMethod(),\nwhere the individual asserts verify that various values of the parameters to method()\nwork (max, min, null, normal, etc). Sure these could all be individual test cases, but then\nit becomes difficult to see whether I really have exhaustively tested my method. Code\ncoverage is not the solution. That only tells me whether what I have written, opposed to\nwhat I should have written, works.\n\n- Tom\n\nJason Rogers schrieb:\n\n&gt; AAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n&gt;\n&gt; Why do you care?  A test fails or it passes.  Period.\n&gt;\n&gt; If you want more, JUnit is probably not the framework to use.  The framework\n&gt; is not meant to give warm fuzzy feelings (interpretation of green bar),\n&gt; pains in the gut (interpretation of red bar), or minor headaches (amber\n&gt; bar?).  It is meant to tell you whether or not the code works the way you\n&gt; think it should.  It&#39;s a SIMPLE framework for developers and testers, not a\n&gt; bogus-meet-all-levels-of-satisfaction-and-feel-goods reporting tool.\n&gt;\n&gt; Sorry for the outburst of frustration.\n&gt; -Jason\n&gt;\n&gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; From: dror2@...

It might still create a Throwable object\n&gt; (without throwing it), just to have  a stack-trace handy.\n&gt;\n&gt; Vladimir Bossicard &lt;vladimir@...&gt;\n&gt; 24/07/2001 23:56\n&gt; Please respond to junit\n&gt;\n&gt;         To:        junit@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;         cc:\n&gt;         Subject:        RE: [junit] Reporting more then 1 failed assertion\n&gt; per test\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; I think it would be useful in certain cases, sort of\n&gt; &gt; like &quot;make -k&quot; (keep going if an error is found).\n&gt;\n&gt; This is not possible with JUnit because JUnit throws an exception when an\n&gt; assertion is not &quot;true&quot;.  When an exception is thrown, &quot;the normal flow of\n&gt; the program is interrupted and that the runtime environment attempts to find\n&gt; an exception handler--a block of code that can handle a particular type of\n&gt; error.&quot; (Java Tutorial)  So the next assertion is not executed.\n&gt;\n&gt; To &quot;correct&quot; that, you have to change the framework (record the errors and\n&gt; throw an exception at the end of the test method).  But I really don&#39;t think\n&gt; that this will solve problems:\n&gt;\n&gt;    assertTrue(obj != null);\n&gt;   assertTrue(obj.status() == 3);\n&gt;\n&gt; if obj is null and you evaluate the next assert, the &quot;NullPointerException&quot;\n&gt; doesn&#39;t help much.\n&gt;\n&gt; -Vladimir\n&gt;\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
