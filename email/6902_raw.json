Whereas non-TDD code would not follow that and could be random.\n\nJust thought this was a very interesting line of thought...\n\nJoel Shellman\n\n&gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; From: Scott Stirling \n&gt; Sent: Thursday, February 06, 2003 8:18 PM\n&gt; To: junit@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Subject: RE: [junit] TDD -&gt; FSM\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; &gt; From: J. B. Rainsberger [mailto:jbr@...]\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Scott:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Have you identified how a test-driven class implements a FSM? If I \n&gt; &gt; give you some code that I test-drove, would you try \n&gt; identifying how it \n&gt; &gt; is a FSM? That would be very interesting.\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;d be willing to try.  I would be interested to have an \n&gt; example that&#39;s not my own or borrowed out of a book.  But I&#39;m \n&gt; working with a few book examples right now, trying to sort \n&gt; things out and see how far I can take this FSM idea.\n&gt; \n&gt; Scott S.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ------------------------ Yahoo!
