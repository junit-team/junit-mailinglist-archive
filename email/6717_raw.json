When is it due for publishing?\n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Sometime this spring.  It&#39;s been tech reviewed (very favourably :-),\n&gt;the foreword is written (a smashing one too :-), it&#39;s being indexed as\n&gt;we &quot;speak&quot;, the cover is being put together, etc. and I&#39;m doing last\n&gt;minute polishing.  So... Real Soon Now.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\nI had the pleasure of being a reviewer of Dave&#39;s upcoming book.  It&#39;s \nchock full of concrete examples of test-driven development in action. \n Moreover, it answers a lot of questions frequently posted on this list \nwith respect to writing effective tests with JUnit.  But Dave doesn&#39;t \nstop there.  He also shows you how to use JUnit extensions and other \nxUnit tools.  Indeed, throughout the book he&#39;s building an application \ntest-first and reaches for a variety of tools along the way.  \n\nSo it&#39;s really at least two great books in one!\n\nMike\n\n-- \nMike Clark\nhttp://clarkware.com\n(720) 851-2014\n\n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n",
