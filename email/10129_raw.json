You will please to know that \nin our country there are lots of young people who are eager to learn \nJava and it&#39;s technology even though Java is not so new to us. I \nrealized that it is necessary to create a Java programmers group in \nBangladesh because it can play an important role to keep communicates \neasily with all the programmers like this group. I honorable invited \njunit members and moderator to keep in touch with us (Bangladesh Java \nUsers Group &quot;BDJUG&quot;). This is really grateful to us. Our BDJUG web \nsite address is www.groups.yahoo.com/group/BDJUG or \nwww.bdjug.cjb.net. \n\nBest regards,\nJunayed Chowdhury\nModerator BDJUG\n\n\n\n\n",
