Then apply \n&gt; it to interfaces or classes for which you need mocks. These new \nmocks \n&gt; will have methods for setting their state, and all support the \nverify\n&gt; () method. YOur mockRepository can be configured to return a \n&gt; mockRepositoryView and to verify that a call was made to that \nmethod. \n&gt; For instance if your code should call getRepositoryView(), you set \nup \n&gt; MockRepository with setExpectedGetRepositoryViewCalls(1). This \nmethod \n&gt; is built in the mock for you by the mockmaker tool. Verify() will \n&gt; check that a single call of getRepositoryView was made on the mock. \n&gt;   This is very useful stuff. However you may have to refactor your \n&gt; code to make it possible to supply a mock object instead of the \nreal \n&gt; object. If you work from interfaces, it is easier to handle mocks. \n&gt; For example if getRepostoryView returns a RepositoryViewInterface \n&gt; rather than a RepositoryView, it is easy to return a \n&gt; MockRepositoryView which implemented RepositoryViewInterface.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In junit@y..., &quot;cilqproj&quot; &lt;cilqproj@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; The problem is that I&#39;m struggling to test a pretty complex piece \nof\n&gt; &gt; code and I&#39;m trying to get some advice ( hints, help, etc .. ) to \n&gt; help\n&gt; &gt; me tackle it.  \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; In the real world, I use ATG Dynamo.  If you&#39;ve heard of it or \nused\n&gt; &gt; it, it&#39;s an App Server / EJB Container.   Dynamo&#39;s entire \nframework \n&gt; is\n&gt; &gt; based off this component known as Nucleus, which does a lot of \nwork \n&gt; in\n&gt; &gt; terms of instantiating classes, setting properties, etc..  It&#39;s \nalso\n&gt; &gt; very slow and to test - build - test takes forever if I have to \n&gt; start\n&gt; &gt; and stop the app-server for every change in the code. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; That&#39;s where MockObjects come in.  Dynamo is a very Java Beans \nheavy\n&gt; &gt; framework, that relies a lot on setters and getters.  ( In fact, \nthe\n&gt; &gt; MockObjects guys at SF have started putting together some Dynamo\n&gt; &gt; MockObjects. ) I was looking into MockObjects as a way to lessen \nmy\n&gt; &gt; reliance on the Nucleus namespace so that I could code quickly and\n&gt; &gt; only integrate with the Nucleus namespace at the latest possible \n&gt; time.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; However, I can&#39;t get my head around the fact that in certain \ncases \n&gt; my\n&gt; &gt; mock code will need to generate other mock code \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Here&#39;s a method from a piece of old code that I wrote before I \n&gt; decided\n&gt; &gt; to start using JUnit:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;     public  Map generateEmptyPreferencesMap( Map m ) throws\n&gt; &gt; RepositoryException {\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \t// get the list of possible preferences\n&gt; &gt; \tRepositoryView contactMethodView = getPreferencesRepository\n&gt; ().getView(\n&gt; &gt; CONTACT_METHOD_REPOSITORY_ITEM );\n&gt; &gt; \tRepositoryItem[] contactMethods = \n&gt; contactMethodView.executeQuery(\n&gt; &gt; contactMethodView.getQueryBuilder().createUnconstrainedQuery() );\n&gt; &gt; \t\n&gt; &gt; \tif ( ( contactMethods != null ) && ( contactMethods.length &gt; \n&gt; 0 ) )  {\n&gt; &gt; \t    // add each one to the map\n&gt; &gt; \t    for ( int i = 0 ; i &lt; contactMethods.length ; i++ ) {\n&gt; &gt; \t\tm.put( contactMethods[i].getPropertyValue(\n&gt; &gt; CONTACT_METHOD_CODE_PROPERTY_NAME ), new BooleanPlaceHolder() );\n&gt; &gt; \t    }\n&gt; &gt; \t}\n&gt; &gt;      return m;\n&gt; &gt;     }\n&gt; &gt;      \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The Repository API is Dynamo&#39;s object-oriented data abstraction \n&gt; api. \n&gt; &gt; In this case, I assume I would setPreferencesRepository( new\n&gt; &gt; MyMockRepository()  )\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; but that MockRepository needs to return a MockRepositoryView \nwhich \n&gt; in\n&gt; &gt; turn needs to return a MockQueryBuilder, or so I seem to believe.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; In a sentence:  how would one test this?  \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; As before,\n&gt; &gt; Any and all help is greatly appreciated.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I apologize for any unnecessary lengthiness.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Thanks,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Aadi\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In junit@y..., Bob Koss &lt;koss@o...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; It would help if you&#39;d tell us what the problem is instead of \n&gt; presenting\n&gt; &gt; &gt; your solution of the problem as the problem.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I&#39;ve never needed mocks inside of mocks - it doesn&#39;t even make \n&gt; sense.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n\n\n",
