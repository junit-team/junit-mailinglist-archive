Our customers are using many\ndifferent app servers, I&#39;m not specifically aware of\nanyone on iAS but it&#39;s probable.  \n\nThe advantage we have over many of the other solutions\nwhen it comes to J2EE is the simplicity of the\ncollection mechanism; they often require you to run\nthe entire application server through another tool, or\nthey use special classloaders, either of which can\ncause a lot of headaches.\n\nA servlet-based reporting mechanism is also expected\nin a near-future release.  (It&#39;s already working, just\nawaiting the &quot;trimmings&quot;.)\n\nScott\n\n--- Howard Lee &lt;howardl815@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Does it intergrate well with Oracle application\n&gt; server\n&gt; (iAS) or any other application server?
