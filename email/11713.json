These private methods only keep adding to the<br/>\n&gt; arraylist which is finally returned by the public method. I need to<br/>\n&gt; write a JUNIT for this class specifically the private methods of this<br/>\n&gt; class. Since these methods are void, how do I write JUNIT test cases<br/>\n&gt; for them???<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You have two problems:<br/>\n<br/>\n1. The methods you want to test return no value.<br/>\n2. The methods you want to test are not public.<br/>\n<br/>\nI write about both problems in _JUnit Recipes_, which you can find <br/>\nonline at www.manning.com/rainsberger<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you prefer to work it out more for yourself, then try using JUnitX to <br/>\nsolve problem #2. As for problem #1, your method needs to have some kind <br/>\nof visible side effect--something you can determine by passing an object <br/>\nin to the method (or the object that contains it). If you can identify <br/>\nthat, then you can make assertions on that.<br/>\n<br/>\nTake care.<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJ. B.
