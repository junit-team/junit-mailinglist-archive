Perhaps we can take a step backwards--what have you\n&gt; been doing with the test name in JUnit 3.8? Perhaps there&#39;s an\n&gt; equivalent strategy in JUnit 4 that doesn&#39;t require getName. Thanks,\n&gt;\n&gt; David Saff\n&gt;\n&gt; On 1/8/07, vkvasudevan &lt;vkvasudevan@ yahoo.com&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Hello,\n&gt; &gt; I have been using junit 3.8.x API, especially the TestCase.getName( ).\n&gt; &gt; This gives me , during runtime, the current test method name.\n&gt; &gt; Now, it time for me to migrate to Junit 4.0. Does any of you know what\n&gt; &gt; is the equivalent API call for getName() in 4.0?\n&gt; &gt; I have tried to use this as it is in 4.0, due to backward\n&gt; &gt; compatability , but a &#39;null&#39; is returned. Subsequently, i have tried to\n&gt; &gt; with various Test runners available with 4.0 but only with\n&gt; &gt; OldTestClassRunner i get the correct information back. With the 4.0\n&gt; &gt; runner TestClassRunner i get &#39;null&#39; always.\n&gt; &gt; Has any of you used the similar call getName() with junit 4.0 ? I there\n&gt; &gt; a similar method in Junit 4.0? or in its extension?\n&gt; &gt; Thanks and Regards\n&gt; &gt; Vasudevan\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Yahoo!
