I can&#39;t imagine a simple checkin or \nupdate taking long enough that you would have time to read mail or news.  We \nalso rename checked-in classes almost daily, and the only CVS issue there is \n&quot;losing&quot; easy access to the file&#39;s history.\n\nSurely the CVS slowness (is the server remote?) is one of the real issues to \nbe addressed in Chris&#39;s situation.  Interesting how a &quot;technical&quot; issue like \nthat can drive the kinds of refactorings people are willing/able to do.\n\nJeff Nielsen\nDigital Focus\nwww.digitalfocus.com\n\n\nFrom: &quot;J. B. Rainsberger&quot; &lt;jbrains@...&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; So that&#39;s &quot;new class&quot;. Copy. Fix layout. Fix suite(). Run tests. Delete\n&gt;&gt; tests. Run. Delete other tests in other class. Run. Check that the two\n&gt;&gt; classes are a partition of the original class. (One *must* do this, so\n&gt;&gt; it&#39;s probably better to do moves than deletes.) Look for shared code\n&gt;&gt; and partition it or move it to a suitable (possibly new) superclass.\n&gt;&gt; (There&#39;s usually some helper code like this.) Link the suite() into\n&gt;&gt; the parent suite. (Yes, we don&#39;t use the automatic recursive suite\n&gt;&gt; creation. Close call: but sometimes being able to trivially comment\n&gt;&gt; out subsuites has made bug-tracking much much easier, since we do\n&gt;&gt; sometimes end up with context-sensitive problems. Perhaps we just\n&gt;&gt; have too many global caches.) Run complete test suite. Stare hard\n&gt;&gt; at the new classname, rename to suitable, because now you have to\n&gt;&gt; introduce it to CVS, and renaming it later is a pain. Perform\n&gt;&gt; introduction. No, I don&#39;t want the file CVSed when it&#39;s created, since\n&gt;&gt; if I want to back it out later (when I realise I made a complete mess)\n&gt;&gt; I don&#39;t want dirty footprints in the repository. OK, everything works.\n&gt;&gt; Check in. Wait forever for CVS to complete. Time passes. Maybe there&#39;s\n&gt;&gt; some mail to read? Yes. Whoppee, CVS done. Change to paranoia window.\n&gt;&gt; CVS update. Wait forever for CVS to complete. Time passes. Mail already\n&gt;&gt; read, read news instead. CVS completes. ant build, run tests, all pass.\n&gt;&gt; Hooray! Don&#39;t do this on a Friday afternoon, you&#39;ll likely miss your\n&gt;&gt; train or break the build.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Somewhere in there I fixed the auto-layout. And did a CVS update (Wait.\n&gt;&gt; Time passes. Get tea.) before running the tests.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; What do you do that if I did it too I could do better? Apart from using\n&gt;&gt; a faster CVS server, that is.\n&gt;\n&gt; Well...\n&gt;\n&gt; 1. I use Subversion, so I don&#39;t have the same CVS issues you seem to\n&gt; have. It also looks like you have far too much stuff in a single CVS\n&gt; server or module. It looks like it&#39;s time to split them.\n&gt;\n\n&lt;snip&gt;\n\n&gt;\n&gt; 6. I&#39;m not sure why renaming a recently-created class is such a pain,\n&gt; even in CVS: it hardly has any history to worry about, so I wouldn&#39;t\n&gt; worry about it.\n&gt;\n\n\n",
