I have a large app that basically wraps an API. The testing <br/>\nthat has to get setup needs to compare states between the app and the <br/>\nAPI to ensure that all business rules comply at every state. Is this <br/>\nsomething that JUnit can/should do? The app has many different states <br/>\nthat I would have to setUp() but I&#39;d like to know if using JUnit is <br/>\nthe most effective way of testing this way?<br/>\n<br/>\nAny advice would be greatly appreciated!<br/>\nClaudio</div>",
