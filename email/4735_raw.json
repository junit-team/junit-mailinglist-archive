Keep in mind that\n&gt; &gt; &gt;if tests have dependencies - you will effectively be blocked from\n&gt; &gt; &gt;executing dependent tests when you encounter a failure. This has a bad\n&gt; &gt; &gt;smell, ...\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; i agree about the bad smell, but i am looking at using junit, cactus,\n&gt; &gt; httpunit etc. to test some web apps. it seems that there are at least 3\n&gt; &gt; levels of tests from unit tests on each class to a functional test of a web\n&gt; &gt; app. and the associated dependencies. ...\n&gt;\n&gt;I&#39;m not sure I follow.  I generally use different isolated test suites for \n&gt;unit\n&gt;vs. integration vs. acceptance tests.\n\nok, that seems like a reasonable separation. i am new to testing and there \nare lots of different types of testing \n(http://tayek.com/~ray/xptools/testing.html). yours seem independent at \nfirst glance.\n\n&gt;  The acceptance tests don&#39;t use the unit or\n&gt;integration tests.  The integration tests don&#39;t use the unit tests.  Each \n&gt;type of\n&gt;test is intended for different types of feedback at different frequencies.\n\nthis is good to know.\n\n&gt;Could you give an example?\n\ni guess i am thinking about a hierarchy:\n\nunit (class) test for each class in a package\npackage test (can the classes in the package work together).\ngo up to the parent package and rinse til done.\n\nthe cactus testing is very dependent on many things. so id httpunit \ntesting, and i had not thought in terms of acceptance testing. also, unit \ntest of a web app seems very far away from the unit test of a class.\n\nmaybe i am just confused here ...\n\nthanks\n\n---\nray tayek http://home.attbi.com/~rtayek/\nactively seeking telecommuting work\nvice chair orange county java users group http://www.ocjug.org/ \nmailto:chair@...\nhate spam? http://samspade.org/ssw/\n\n\n",
