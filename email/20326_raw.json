I&#39;ve a unit test case\n&gt;  which makes sure my functionality is working as per expected behavior.\n&gt;\n&gt;  The method I followed here is simple, I&#39;ve tried injecting the mock\n&gt;  objects into my code so that my functionality uses the mock objects\n&gt;  instead of actual &#39;Real Time&#39; Connection object.\n&gt;\n&gt;  But after I finished the whole functionality, I realized that it\n&gt;  didn&#39;t work with a &#39;Real Time&#39; Connection object. I figured out the\n&gt;  reason is that I never worried about the &#39;Real&#39; connection object when\n&gt;  I was unit testing my code.\n&gt;\n&gt;  My question is..\n&gt;\n&gt;  1) Whose responsibility is to initialize this &#39;Real&#39; object in my class ?\n&gt;  2) Should my unit tests cover this &#39;Initializing real time objects&#39; as\n&gt;  well ?\n&gt;  3) What way I can assure that my &#39;Real&#39; objects are initialized\n&gt;  properly ?\n&gt;\n&gt;  I&#39;m totally stuck here. Any suggestion would be of great help to me..\n&gt;\n&gt;  Thanks in advance.\n&gt;\n&gt;  Sarat\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n\n",
