You owe the Oracle a set of ear plugs to block out the sound of millions of keyboards beeping over the next 24 hours as the junit mailing list subscribers read their email (and these offtopic messages), and try this out. :-)\n\nP.P.S. If you&#39;ve never heard of the Usenet^H^H^H^H^H^HInternet Oracle s/he will answer your questions at http://cgi.cs.indiana.edu/~oracle/index.cgi  (Strangely enough the keys Z-O-T don&#39;t beep for me)\n\n\nOn Thu, Mar 03, 2005 at 11:44:40AM -0800, Kevin Klinemeier wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; I have a T42, and haven&#39;t seen this behavior at all.  \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; On Thu, 03 Mar 2005 10:07:15 -0800, Kevin Lawrence\n&gt; &lt;kevin@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I have an IBM Thinkpad and if I type *assertEquals() very quickly, it\n&gt; &gt; beeps.
