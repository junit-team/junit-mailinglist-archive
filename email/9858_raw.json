If your public methods are already covered with tests, you have to\nstop and ask yourself why the private method needs testing at all..\nisn&#39;t the testing through the public interface sufficient.  If you\nfeel that you do need to do more testing, refactor to remove the\nprivate method.  The nicest way to do this is to create a new class\nand move the method over to it as a public method.  You can use the\ntests that you have to verify that you did the move correctly.\n\n2. If your public methods aren&#39;t covered with tests and you need to\ntest a private method, make it package-scope.  This may feel weird,\nbut it gives you coverage and allows you to move towards a clearer\nsolution later.\n\n\nMichael Feathers\nwww.objectmentor.com\n\n\n\n",
