I know of very few developers \nhere in the UK that are working for companies completely au fait with \nJSE5, and Mustang is only a month or so around the corner!\n\nWhat benefits would converting JUnit 4 to JSE4 bring, beyond flexibility \nin test naming and ordering?\n\nBTW, is there still any development effort intended for JUnit 3.8.x? If \nso, I&#39;d like to volunteer! :)\n--\nStephen Smith, MEng (Wales).\nhttp://www.stephen- &lt;http://www.stephen-smith.co.uk/&gt; smith.co.uk/\n\nSimon Chappell wrote:\n&gt; On 9/14/06, Robert Wenner &lt;robert.wenner@ &lt;mailto:robert.wenner%40gmx.de&gt;\ngmx.de&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt; On Tuesday 12 September 2006 09:30, Mark Levison wrote:\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Unfortunately some of us work in corporate\n&gt;&gt;&gt; environments where use of Java 1.5 will take at least another couple of\n&gt;&gt;&gt; years (we only just dropped support for Java 1.3).

At many sites in the US of A, including my current\n&gt; and several previous ones, will often specify that users not be given\n&gt; administration rights to their workstations and, further, that the\n&gt; download and install (in case you get around the lack of admin rights)\n&gt; of any unauthorised software (and they usually get picky down to the\n&gt; version numbers) is a dismissible offence. This doesn&#39;t make sense,\n&gt; applied to developers, but corporate policies are a very real fact of\n&gt; life for many of us. This is why many of us are not able to switch,\n&gt; even for non-production and develoment machines.\n&gt; \n&gt; Simon\n&gt; \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n",
