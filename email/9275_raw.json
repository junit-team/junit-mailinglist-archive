However I am still not convinced how\n&gt; would one apply these in large systems.  In particular, in compilers and \n&gt; related topics.\n\nHow to apply them to large systems is something that&#39;s well-worn by this \npoint. Large systems are just larger collections of objects, so not much \nis different.\n\nAs for compilers, your message seems to claim that building a compiler \nincrementally is not possible, or perhaps just not feasible. The way to \nbuild a compiler incrementally -- assuming you do not use any existing \ntools like parser generators -- is to pick one language feature and \nsupport it, then another, then another until you support the entire \nlanguage.\n\nAnother approach is to start by implementing an interpreter, work to \nsupport the entire language, then use the interpreter as a test \nenvironment to write the corresponding compiler. That&#39;s just an idea \nthat comes off the top of my head and I have no idea whether it&#39;s feasible.\n\nYour question, it seems to me, is about incremental development and not \nTDD and not JUnit. Is that accurate? I only mention that because it&#39;s \neasier to answer a question once I understand the question.\n-- \nJ. B.
