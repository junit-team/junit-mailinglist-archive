For example you should probably have Acceptance Tests.\n\n&gt; So, I know that I will be using a combination of Jtest and\n&gt; Junit for a long time to come. If you write optimal code\n&gt; without the need for automated testing tools, then I salute you! :-)\n\nWho said that the only alternative to not using JTest was to use no\nautomated testing tool at all?\n\nBTW, are you developing test-first?\n\n\n&gt; &gt;&gt; I would actually interpret these exceptions as an indication\n&gt; &gt;of some extra guard conditions and more defensive programming\n&gt; &gt;needed within the tested code. If a piece of called code\n&gt; &gt;cannot handle unexpected inputs, then the fault lies with the\n&gt; &gt;code and not the inputs. :-)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;I disagree. If the input violates a precondition, the fault\n&gt; &gt;lies with the input, by definition.\n&gt;\n&gt; I wholeheartedly disagree with you. It makes no difference\n&gt; what your &quot;contract&quot; is between a piece of software and it&#39;s\n&gt; callers, if the software doesn&#39;t check it&#39;s own inputs then\n&gt; it is at fault.\n\nMhh, I wasn&#39;t talking about the input to the software, but about the\ninput from internal components to internal components. Would you agree\nthat precondition possibly isn&#39;t that critical there?\n\nRegards, Ilja\n\n\n",
