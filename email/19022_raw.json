However, currently, when it comes to\n&quot;well-formedness&quot; of JUnit classes, the answer is either yes or no,\nand since...\n\n&gt; I suspect you don&#39;t want to get into &quot;JUnit lint&quot; territory\n\n... is true, I&#39;m not yet convinced to change this.  In short, I could\nmake @Ignore @BeforeClass declare the class malformed, with specific\ndirections to the developer about how to accomplish what they want.\nWould that meet the actual pain point?\n\nIt&#39;s of course not impossible to change JUnit to have well-formed,\nsomewhat well-formed, and not-at-all well-formed classes, but I&#39;m not\nyet convinced that there&#39;s pain pushing me in that direction.\n\n&gt; but at the\n&gt; same time, users are quite logically trying to use @Ignore in a context\n&gt; you didn&#39;t intend, but that nevertheless makes sense to them, and in\n&gt; general.\n\nVery true, and I hadn&#39;t given that enough credit yet.\n\n&gt; If @Ignore-ing a @Test stops the test from running, then why doesn&#39;t\n&gt; @Ignore-ing a @Before stop the before from running? This is, perhaps,\n&gt; why I wouldn&#39;t support @Ignore, but would rather just ask the test\n&gt; writer to remove the @Test annotation when he doesn&#39;t want the test to\n&gt; run. I don&#39;t know that @Ignore provides better results than removing the\n&gt; @Test annotation temporarily.\n\nIs this a separate issue?  Are you suggesting that, given the choice,\nyou would not have included @Ignore, with the attendant reminder to\nun-@Ignore sometime in the future, in JUnit at all?  I&#39;m curious about\nthat position, but first want to make sure if it is your position.\nThanks,\n\n   David Saff\n\n",
