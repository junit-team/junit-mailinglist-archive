Pardon the =20 and =2Es]<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;quote&gt;<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; This is all definitely worth knowing, but my immediate guess is that<br/>\n&gt; the JUnitDoclet user is (re)generating far too many tests at once,<br/>\n&gt; irrespective of whether those tests say fail() or not<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>If you mean, that in a non-TDD environment, there are many<br/>\nempty test methods in the beginning, that is true. (The next<br/>\nversion of JUnitDoclet will at least count them and print that<br/>\nnumber as warning.) But as a coach I actually have seen a<br/>\nremarkable thing:<br/>\n<br/>\n  Because it is so easy to write a test _then_ (once there is<br/>\n  a place for it) they get written naturally. Developers know<br/>\n  the importance of tests, the just need help to get started.<br/>\n&lt;/quote&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is easy to write a test then, but it&#39;s not necessarily the proper test<br/>\nto write=2E Test-After leads to a testing methods, rather than testing<br/>\nbehavior=2E One of the points of TDD is to identify what behavior is requi=<br/>\nred<br/>\nup front, then implement just enough of it=2E There is already overhead to=<br/>\n<br/>\nwriting unnecessary code; there is much more overhead in testing<br/>\nunnecessary code=2E Generating test stubs abdicates the programmer of his<br/>\nresponsibility to ask himself the question, &quot;Do I need to test this method=<br/>\n?<br/>\nDo I even need this method at all?&quot; That&#39;s one reason why I distrust the<br/>\nTest-After process=2E<br/>\n<br/>\nStill, that&#39;s easy for me to say, because I don&#39;t have millions of lines o=<br/>\nf<br/>\nuntested (and untestable) legacy code standing between me and the delivery=<br/>\n<br/>\ndate=2E I have respect for the people who effectively deal with that probl=<br/>\nem=2E<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;quote&gt;<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; It is important for us to remember our TDD bias=2E :)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>BTW: Did you ever consider to generate a test from an empty=20<br/>\nbut compilable application method?
