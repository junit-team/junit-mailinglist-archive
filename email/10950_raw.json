But it was *never* legitimate to make a virtue\n&gt;&gt; &gt; of necessity, to say (as you do) that &quot;separation is the solution.&quot;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Now that you *can* drive your UIs from JUnit, and therefore you can\n&gt;&gt; &gt; *fully* test your UIs, your claim is illegitimate, and moreover\n&gt;&gt; &gt; encourages the &quot;anti-test-infection.&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;I resemble this remark, and it&#39;s hard to refute.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;I still don&#39;t have the necessary skill to do very well what Thomas rightly\n&gt;&gt;recommends, but I believe that he&#39;s right.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Separation is, however, a majority of the solution. It is easily 80% of \n&gt; the solution, if not more. I hope that readers do not interpret your \n&gt; remark to mean that separation is ineffective.\n\n\n\nThinking it through I have to agree - the long term solution includes \nseparation of GUI from data/control (a la MVC), but testing the GUI is \nentirely necessary, and may show up issues/bugs that are unrelated to \nthe underlying application.\n\nIndeed, if I&#39;d considered the pain I&#39;m suffering on my current project \ndue to just these issues, I probably would have phrased my reply in a \ndifferent way.\n\n\nRegards,\nJim Cheesman.\n\n\n\n",
