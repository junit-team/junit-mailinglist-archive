I can see how you&#39;d think that if you\nview/practice software development as an engineering activity.  I\ndon&#39;t.\n\nThat&#39;s also not very agile.  \n\n- Do TDD\n- Come up with a list of tests that nail down the behaviour you need\nto implement. \n- Write each test, then the code to pass it... one test at a time.\n- run a coverage tool against the running of your test suite to find\nholes in your test coverage.\n- fill in those holes as desired (do you really need to test\ntoString().. maybe.. maybe not)\n- run Jester to see if you have some sloppy tests (or redundant code)\n- fix as required.\n\nBetter to do it & measure the results than to try & figure it all out\nahead of time.\n\nDave \n\n\n",
