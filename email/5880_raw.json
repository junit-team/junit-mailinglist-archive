The common\n&gt; topics that appear when discussing the complexity of JUnit are Suites\n&gt; and Tests, where this is just a typical instantiation of the Composite\n&gt; pattern.  The TestResult is a collecting parameter, and so on.\n&gt;\n&gt; I am one of those people who puts JUnit forward as an example to be\n&gt; followed, and am, so far, unswayed from that position.  My views are\n&gt; based on the code for JUnit 3.7, but I can only imagine that it has\n&gt; gotten better, and not worse in the latest release.\n&gt;\n&gt; As is usually the case when using patterns in code, to the non-initiated\n&gt; any such code may look very complex indeed, and the relationships\n&gt; between the different classes unfathomable.  The benefits for those who\n&gt; do recognise the patterns, however, is great.\n&gt;\n&gt; Manuel Amago.\n&gt; mailto:mamago@...\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
