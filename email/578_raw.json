As I&#39;m Trying NOW to make the code bug - free I&#39;m writting the Junit test cases for that class. My very first test being to always validate the construction of an instance of the object, After setUp doing simply a super.setUp(), I created a first test that simply creates an instance of the targetted class, doing :\n&lt;pre&gt;\n  MyInstance = new ReadXMLwithDOM();\n  asssert(&quot;Could not instanciate class&quot;, MyInstance);\n&lt;/pre&gt;\n \nthe problem is finally that it seems that there&#39;s a linkage Exception being thrown rather stupidly with the DOM parser does effectively the PARSING.\n&lt;pre&gt;\n      factory = DocumentBuilderFactory.newInstance();\n      input = new InputSource(new FileReader(aFileName));\n      builder = factory.newDocumentBuilder();\n      doc = builder.parse(input);\n      ER = ExitRule.parseDocument(doc, Log); &lt;--- Line giving the problem\n&lt;/pre&gt;\n\nThe ExitRule class has a static method to automatically do the parsing. I&#39;ve added to my excluded/properties file the following :\n\n   excluded.6=org.xml.*\n   excluded.7=org.xml.sax.*\n   excluded.8=be.telenet.sacramento.cafe.*\n   excluded.9=com.sun.xml.parser.*\n\nI gess exclusion is recursive (?).\n\nStill the method fails miserably with a rather long trace that starts with \njava.lang.LinkageError Class org.xml.sax.InputSource violates loader constraints at ...\n...\n...\n...\n\n\n\nThomas,\n\np.s. : Here below the reference found on the current ML\n\n&lt;pre&gt;\n&lt;snip&gt;\nSubject  Author  Date  \n424  Re: ClassLoader constraints violation  Rupert  Fri 2/9/2001  \n420  Re: ClassLoader constraints violation  john prince  Fri 2/9/2001  \n419  Re: ClassLoader constraints violation  Erik Hanson  Thu 2/8/2001  \n400  ClassLoader constraints violation  Rupert  Wed 2/7/2001  \n&lt;/snip&gt;\n&lt;/pre&gt;\n---\n\nThomas SMETS - Application Engineer\nSydney-Tristar Devlopment Cpy \n\n",
