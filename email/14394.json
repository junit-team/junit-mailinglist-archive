Maybe I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; just being sentimental here but the Graphical TestRunner&#39;s green<br/>\n&gt; bar/red<br/>\n&gt; bar was one of the earliest delights of Junit.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Besides, as a casual user of Java I have yet to find the energy to<br/>\n&gt; learn<br/>\n&gt; an IDE.  When I do have to code Java I generally use my normal text<br/>\n&gt; editor and the graphical test runner, which I find is quicker and<br/>\n&gt; easier<br/>\n&gt; to use than the text version.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I know Kent has an evangelising streak - automated unit testing,<br/>\n&gt; xp/agile, etc - which he has used well in the service of the software<br/>\n&gt; community but I think insisting on the use of an IDE is a crusade too<br/>\n&gt; far.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I was disappointed by this news as well.  I do use an IDE for most of<br/>\nthe day, but when I have to work remotely I use &#39;vi&#39; over SSH and a GUI<br/>\nTestRunner on my local machine.  So personally, I would like to have at<br/>\nleast one graphical TestRunner. (Yes, I know that I could set up many<br/>\nIDEs to do the same thing -- Eclipse for instance -- but that chews up<br/>\ntoo many resources on my laptop.)<br/>\n<br/>\nKent, perhaps you would consider adding a community section to CVS and<br/>\nallow us to add code there.  You can document this portion of the<br/>\nrepository as being &quot;unwarranted&quot; (whatever that would mean).  It would<br/>\nallow for the community to add their $0.02.  I don&#39;t think anyone wants<br/>\nto make more work for you or Erich, but it would be nice to have an easy<br/>\nway for everyone to use JUnit in a way that is comfortable to them.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJason Rogers<br/>\n<br/>\nI am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ<br/>\nliveth in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the<br/>\nfaith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me.<br/>\n(Galatians 2:20)</div>",
