While other are =\r\nfixing the library, your\n&gt; tests are still broken but it&#39;s still ok to comm=\r\nit new code (because no other\n&gt; new test fail)...\n\nI always thought the sol=\r\nution was that you maintained a list of tests NOT \nto run. This list may va=\r\nry by platform (some tests don&#39;t work on platform X\nbecause it doesn&#39;t supp=\r\nort threading, or whatever), and it may change over\ntime (as a bug in a lib=\r\nrary is discovered, then later fixed). The list itself\nis clear documentati=\r\non. The only trick is getting junit to not run the tests\non the list... dep=\r\nends on how you run your tests. (Eg: a master suite class\nthat collects tog=\r\nether all the tests, or an ant task that lists them...\nwhatever it is, enha=\r\nnce it to respect your SKIPPED_TESTS list.)\n\n-- Michael Chermside\n\n\n",
