The answer that I received \nwas to use a decorator. It works this way. But I cannot execute a \ntest with its decorator in Eclipse. So I cannot use it.\n\nHere is the bug report which I posted at the Eclipse site. Its bug \n76232. Since I didn&#39;t receive any answer there, I post it here. I \nhope someone can help me.\n\n\n\nI want to perform something before the tests start. After all tests \nof a class have finished I want to perform another thing. Overwriting \ntearDown does not work for this requirement, it is called too often \nby JUnit. When the last test has finished I want to perform \nsomething. But it needs to be within JUnit, not outside of it.\n\nI&#39;ve coded something like this in the main method to solve the \nproblem:\nTestDecorator myTestSetup = new MyTestSetup(new SupplierArticleTest\n(&quot;testInitialValidation&quot;));\njunit.textui.TestRunner.run(myTestSetup);\n\nIt works but it doesn&#39;t work in the Eclipse JUnit view. It should \nwork in the JUnit view. Can I decorate a test and start it with its \ndecoration in the Eclipse JUnit view? Or is there another solution \nfor my problem?\n\nThe most straightforward thing would have been if I had two \nadditional methods in the TestCase: setUpTestCase() and \ntearDownTestCase(). Both would be called only once, the first, when \nthe test (all test methods in a TestCase) starts and the last when \nthe test ends (all test methods in a TestCase).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
