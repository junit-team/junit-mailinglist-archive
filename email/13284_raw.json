With &quot;test data&quot; \nI mean data which I create in my test program and which I persist in \nthe database. After the test finished, I delete the test data (with an \nEntityGarbageCollector).\n\nBut our new project leader thinks we should use only real data (&quot;one \ndataset for all tests&quot;). I don&#39;t think that this would work. We need \nboth strategies I think, even if one solution seems to be redundant.\n\nTo only use real test data has big disadvantages in my opinion:\n- if data changes (real data does), then tests break\n- you need much more real data than test data to cover all the \nboundaries and use cases\n- if you add real data or remove real data from the dataset, tests \nmight break\n\nWhat do you think about it?\n\n\n\n\n",
