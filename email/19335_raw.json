In 10-15 minutes what do you try and build? Any\n&gt; reason you choose it? Anything in particular you try to demonstrate?\n&gt; \n&gt; With apologies if you see this posting twice - my gmail account is\n&gt; getting caught in yahoo&#39;s aggressive spam filter. Given the time\n&gt; sensitive nature of this question I&#39;m reposting via the web interface.\n\nA very late answer, and perhaps useless, but I use Fraction, since it&#39;s \ngeeky enough to be cool and simple enough to be accessible by the whole \ncrowd. It demonstrates things like replacing one field with two \nequivalent ones, inlining constructors and driving the design of an \nindependent method (NumberTheory.gcd()) that might or might not need its \nown tests. It raises a good number of questions for a 90-minute demo \n(with Q&A as we go).\n-- \nJ. B.
