If the system\n&gt;  &gt; is really that big, and test runs take hours, then I would immediately\n&gt;  &gt; evaluate the benefits of splitting that system into loosely coupled\n&gt;  &gt; parts and evolving them in separate source trees.\n&gt; \n&gt; You can run, but you can&#39;t hide :-)\n\nYou always find me...\n\n&gt; Eventually, any software that becomes reasonably complex takes time testing,\n&gt; and I don&#39;t think there is any way around that.  My experiences range from\n&gt; small software (TestNG - 300 tests, less than 10 seconds to run them all) to\n&gt; fairly large ones, where functional tests takes anywhere between five and\n&gt; ten hours (yes, 5 and 10).  Using groups in such systems is invaluable.\n\nIf functional tests take 10 hours, then is it really one application? \nI&#39;m imagining that in 10 hours we can run 5,000 functional tests, and it \nseems to me that that&#39;s a large number for a system that can&#39;t \nreasonably be modularized into a few small projects. I would have \nprobably started considering that after the tests started taking 30 minutes.\n\n&gt; Although I have to say that for such large scale software, the hurdle is\n&gt; usually much more the communication between the QA and the engineering teams\n&gt; than it is about test infrastructure, but every bit counts.\n\nIndeed.\n\n&gt; Agree, that&#39;s why groups called &quot;fast&quot; and &quot;slow&quot; make much more sense than\n&gt; &quot;unit&quot; and &quot;functional&quot;, in my opinion.\n\nAbsolutely. I tend to use &quot;fast&quot; and &quot;slow&quot;, knowing that isolated \nobject tests tend to be fast by their very nature, and slow tests tend \nto be integration/system/load/end-to-end.\n\n&gt; Fair point.  It looks like in this particular case, your experience does not\n&gt; match mine and Jon&#39;s.\n\nThat&#39;ll happen.\n-- \nJ. B.
