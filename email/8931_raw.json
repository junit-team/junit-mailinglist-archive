Ant&#39;s &lt;formatter&gt;s are extensions of\n&gt;\tTestListener.  So I&#39;d say Ant uses quite a bit of the framework.\n&gt;\t&lt;snip&gt;\n&gt;\tAnt even has a specialized TestCase implementation for tests that want\n&gt;\tto invoke Ant targets as part of the tests (like most Ant&#39;s own tests\n&gt;\tdo).\n&gt;\n&gt;\tI&#39;d rather say it shows the flexibility of the JUnit framework than\n&gt;\tcall it a shame.\n\nI apologize in advance if this seems contentious & I am not meaning to be\nrude -- recall, junit rocks -- but this is an honest question/statement\ntrying to figure out the balance of framework verses user benefit. (User in\nthis case being ant or Eclipse or...)\n\nWhat I consider a shame is the amount of stuff used in order to &quot;leverage\nthe framework&quot;. I&#39;m sorry, but it seems to me that there is little or no use\nof the framework, ant has effectively re-written it. Sure, it is nice that a\nframework can have extension points, but it seems a shame to need to\nleverage so many. It seems (from reading this) that ant leverages the\ntestcase class &quot;assert&quot; helper methods & little else.\n\nBTW: I use the BuildFileTest class to test my ant tasks/scripts. Very nice,\nthank you ant. :-) That said, I have a problem when running them inside\nEclipse &#39;cos they (I believe) use  paths relative to the project they are\nin. The Eclipse test collector finds tests in dependent projects, but then\nruns them in this projects context, so the tests break not finding the ant\nscripts. Any thoughts on how I solve this, or if there are one or two bugs I\nought report? You just seem a good person to ask both question to & this\nseems as good a place/context as any. Thanks in advance. :-)\n\nregards\n\nAdam\n\n\n",
