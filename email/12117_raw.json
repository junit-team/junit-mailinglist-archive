A test I&#39;d just written and expected to fail \ndidn&#39;t.  On 11 Sep 2004 you made a change to TestCase:\n\nTestCase.java 1.15\n&quot;Make sure an exception thrown during tearDown() doesn&#39;t mask an\nexception thrown during running the test. I don&#39;t much like the \nTestCase.runBare()\ncode but I can&#39;t see how to simplify it. It was so much simpler \nbefore. Sniff...&quot;\n\nWhile the code now makes sure that if tearDown() throws an exection \nafter runTest() has thrown one, the exception from the test takes \npreference.  Unfortunately, if tearDown() DOESN&#39;T throw an exception \nthe exception from runTest() is completely masked!!  Local \nvariable &#39;running&#39; needs to be checked at the end of the method to \nthrow any exception on normal exit!\n\nHow can this be I asked?  Surely JUnit&#39;s own unit tests would have a \ncheck for something as simple as a test not failing when it should?  \nThen I realised, of course, if it&#39;s using the same version of \nTestCase, the failure will never be seen!\n\nObviously not enough people who are using the CVS version are \nchecking that their tests fail when they should ;-)!\n\nCheers,\n\nAndrew\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
