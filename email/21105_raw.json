Let us say that I had test classes, Test0, Test1. Each of these\n&gt; requires a backend to be configured. I&#39;d like to do something like this:\n&gt;\n&gt; @RunWith(Suite.class)\n&gt; @...({Test0.class, Test1.class})\n&gt; public abstract class MySuite{\n&gt; abstract public void setBackend(Backend backend);\n&gt;\n&gt; @BeforeClass\n&gt; public static void doSetup() throws Exception{\n&gt; //... stuff to get this all pulled together and configure the tests\n&gt; }\n&gt; }\n&gt;\n&gt; Then all a tester needs to do is extend the class MySuite, implement the\n&gt; method and s/he gets to run their backend against my tests.\n&gt;\n&gt; Complicating factors are that java does not allow for annotations to be\n&gt; inherited unless the @interface is created with the @Inherited\n&gt; annotation, so attempts to do what is above kick back the message that\n&gt; there are no tests to run or some such. At least this is my\n&gt; understanding of java annotations...\n&gt;\n&gt; The real life example has not just a couple of test classes, but many\n&gt; more that very rigorously exercise the backend. The kludge is to have\n&gt; the abstract MySuite class and have the annotations cut and pasted every\n&gt; time. This is bad since it will make maintainability problematic (we\n&gt; have lots of different backend configurations people want to test\n&gt; against). What&#39;s more several people who want to use this really don&#39;t\n&gt; know that much about jUnit and we&#39;d really like it to be the case they\n&gt; can write a backend then get good feedback on robustness, failure modes,\n&gt; you name it.\n&gt;\n&gt; Is this clearer?\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks in Advance!\n&gt;\n&gt; Jeff\n&gt;\n&gt; David Saff wrote:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Jeff,\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Can you expand on what you mean by &quot;The problem is that making a suite\n&gt;&gt; using annotations does not really work so well.

Now,\n&gt;&gt; &gt; these run against a single backend and now several developers in my\n&gt;&gt; &gt; group would like to use these tests against other backends to test them.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; The most natural way to do this is with the test suite mechanism in\n&gt;&gt; &gt; jUnit. That is to say, make up a suite that requires merely that the\n&gt;&gt; &gt; backend be set and test away. Or so I thought.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; The different backends are different projects in our group and live in\n&gt;&gt; &gt; different Maven modules.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; The problem is that making a suite using annotations does not really\n&gt;&gt; &gt; work so well. The annotations are not inherited. The other solution\n&gt;&gt; &gt; which is to have the developers make their own suites by annotations is\n&gt;&gt; &gt; also very clunky and will probably break at some point.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; So here is my question: Is there any way to make a test suite that is a\n&gt;&gt; &gt; harness and can be reused?\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; I assume that jUnit 3.8&#39;s method of explicitly creating a suite is going\n&gt;&gt; &gt; to get deprecated soon, right? So that would be a deadend. Also, are\n&gt;&gt; &gt; their plans to make annotations inheritable at some point in jUnit? We\n&gt;&gt; &gt; could maybe live with cutting and pasting for the short term if we knew\n&gt;&gt; &gt; that this issue would get resolved at some point.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Thanks!\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Jeff\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; \n\n",
