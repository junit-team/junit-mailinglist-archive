I have a few problems<br/>\n&gt; with that: <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; - Writing mocks takes time, especially for packages not<br/>\n&gt; designed for this (try mocking JMS factories or obscure JDBC<br/>\n&gt; drivers).  It also forces you to maintain an entire parallel<br/>\n&gt; hierarchy and basically reimplement entire API&#39;s (which are<br/>\n&gt; sometimes based on concrete implementations and not<br/>\n&gt; interfaces). That&#39;s a lot of code clutter.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>That&#39;s true. On the other hand it will also prevent a lot of trouble:<br/>\n<br/>\n- it&#39;s easier to write the tests (which might already result in an<br/>\nimprovement in overall test writing time),<br/>\n- the tests run faster,<br/>\n- you can test conditions that are virtually impossible to reliably induce<br/>\nwithout mocks,<br/>\n- your overall design improves, because thinking about how to write the<br/>\nmocks helps you to come up with better decoupled classes<br/>\n<br/>\nIn my experience, systematic use of mocks generally decreases development<br/>\ntime and improves code quality.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; But worse:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; - You are not testing exactly what goes in production.<br/>\n&gt; Introduce a subtle bug in your mock (return null instead of a<br/>\n&gt; real value) and your tests will pass on your test machines and fail<br/>\n&gt; in production. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>True again. You will still want to have *some* integrations tests, that<br/>\nfully test 1-2-3-4 in concert. In my experience it&#39;s more effective having<br/>\nmost of the tests not doing that, though.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Writing mocks should be an option, but the testing framework<br/>\n&gt; should let me use dependencies and test production code if I<br/>\n&gt; so choose, and unfortunately, JUnit is of no help there.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You should keep in mind that Junit is meant to be a *unit* testing<br/>\nframework, not a panacea. I&#39;m quite comfortable with Junit concentrating on<br/>\nits core responsibility, and using an extension or a different framework for<br/>\nfunctional tests.<br/>\n<br/>\nTake care, Ilja</div>",
