One is named Micah, and is rather<br/>\nuser-friendly most of the time, but has a somewhat draining<br/>\nmaintenance schedule, and sporadic uptime.  The other doesn&#39;t yet have<br/>\na last name that we&#39;re sharing, although I expect the first name will<br/>\nbe &quot;Google&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for understanding if your great questions and valuable patches<br/>\nare responded to with more delay over the coming weeks.<br/>\n<br/>\n   David Saff</div>",
