Please sugg=\r\nest something in this regard.\n\nI have always been in testing and that too f=\r\nunctinality/manual\ntesting. So I was never involved in deveopment or automa=\r\nted testing.\n\nBut these days, talks are going on in our project to automate=\r\n some of\nour testing tasks. For this they want to use Junit as the main tes=\r\nting\ntool. But also, we want to have a GUI, through which test data can be\n=\r\nentered or the other option being, maintaining the test data in an xml\nfile=\r\n and then automating the process of extracting values from that\nfile and us=\r\ning those values in test cases which can be run\ncontinuously one after the =\r\nanother, each time taking a different set\nof value from the file.\n\nAlso, th=\r\ne result of the test case should be communicated back to the\ntester.\n\nPleas=\r\ne suggest how this can be achieved and what sort of\nframework/design should=\r\n be used for this test suite.\n\nWill be waiting for response from all the me=\r\nmbers of the group.\n\n\n\n\n\n",
