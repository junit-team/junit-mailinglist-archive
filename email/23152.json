(Even though, I<br/>\ndo have a reduced ability of this compared to others.)<br/>\n<br/>\nAssuming that you were serious....<br/>\n<br/>\nI can not speak for the authors of the language, nor do I care to.  Yet,<br/>\nI&#39;ve always been under the impression that to transfer a fork of an API<br/>\nunder a new fresh license, a person/group would have to start without any of<br/>\nthe original code.  I&#39;m no lawyer, but to claim that a patch to a given set<br/>\nof source code could release without holding onto the original license might<br/>\nnot be possible under the copy left provision.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs a plea from myself, others may join in...<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease don&#39;t make my life more troublesome by introducing a freshly grown<br/>\nJUnit-esque API, that some corporate manager like.  While as a developer, I<br/>\nwill see some uniqueness that will make my code writing experience less<br/>\nenjoyable.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut as The Dude would say to me... &quot;Yeah, well, you know, that&#39;s just, like,<br/>\nyour opinion, man.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOn Sat, Jan 15, 2011 at 9:14 AM, jaroslavtulach<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jaroslav.tulach@...\">jaroslav.tulach@...</a>&gt;wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Very interesting, thanks for sharing the links!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://dev.eclipse.org/blogs/mike/2009/04/16/one-small-step-towards-reducing-license-proliferation/\">http://dev.eclipse.org/blogs/mike/2009/04/16/one-small-step-towards-reducing-license-proliferation/</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; It has not come to my mind[1] that EPL1.0 supercedes CPL1.0! When I asked<br/>\n&gt; for &quot;more modern license&quot; I did not know how close I was. Proliferation of<br/>\n&gt; various open source licenses is bad and I am glad upgrading to EPL1.0 is<br/>\n&gt; allowed by CPL1.0. It can safe a lot of troubles.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Now, when it is clear that EPL1.0 is the natural evolution step, I can<br/>\n&gt; offer some help. Kent mentioned that he has no capacity to change the<br/>\n&gt; license himself. I can help changing all the JUnit sources and create a<br/>\n&gt; patch. The rest would be just a matter of incorporating my changes into main<br/>\n&gt; source line and releasing binaries for under the new license...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Shall we walk this path?<br/>\n&gt; -jt<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; [1] The license would rather be called CPL1.1 if &quot;the superceeding&quot; was the<br/>\n&gt; plan from begining...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a> &lt;junit%40yahoogroups.com&gt;,<br/>\n&gt; &quot;milestravisparker&quot; &lt;milesparker@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; The following posts might be helpful..<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://dev.eclipse.org/blogs/mike/2009/04/16/one-small-step-towards-reducing-license-proliferation/\">http://dev.eclipse.org/blogs/mike/2009/04/16/one-small-step-towards-reducing-license-proliferation/</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://forums.pentaho.com/showthread.php?69944-License-upgrade-from-CPL-to-EPL\">http://forums.pentaho.com/showthread.php?69944-License-upgrade-from-CPL-to-EPL</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; IANAL either but the section 7 language does appear to give any<br/>\n&gt; contributor the right to release under a successor license, and EPL is a<br/>\n&gt; successor.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Hope you guys can get it sorted out!<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a> &lt;junit%40yahoogroups.com&gt;, Kent Beck<br/>\n&gt; &lt;kentb@&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Dear Jaroslav,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Thank you for the message.
