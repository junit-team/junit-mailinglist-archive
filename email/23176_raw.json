We&#39;re happy to announce the release of JUnit 4.9b2.\nThis release&#39;s theme is Test-class and suite level Rules.\nMore information linked from\nhttp://saffgreenbar.blogspot.com/2011/01/junit-49b2-beta-released.html,\nand release notes below.\nShare and enjoy, and please try it out and give us feedback.  Thanks,\n\nYour friendly neighborhood JUnit maintainers\n\n\n## Summary of Changes in version 4.9 [unreleased!] ##\n\nRelease theme: Test-class and suite level Rules.\n\n### ClassRule ###\n\nThe `ClassRule` annotation extends the idea of method-level Rules,\nadding static fields that can affect the operation of a whole class.  Any\nsubclass of `ParentRunner`, including the standard `BlockJUnit4ClassRunner`\nand `Suite` classes, will support `ClassRule`s.\n\nFor example, here is a test suite that connects to a server once before\nall the test classes run, and disconnects after they are finished:\n\n\t@RunWith(Suite.class)\n\t@SuiteClasses({A.class, B.class, C.class})\n\tpublic class UsesExternalResource {\n\t\tpublic static Server myServer= new Server();\n\t\n\t\t@Rule\n\t\tpublic static ExternalResource resource= new ExternalResource() {\n\t\t\t@Override\n\t\t\tprotected void before() throws Throwable {\n\t\t\t\tmyServer.connect();\n\t\t\t};\n\t\n\t\t\t@Override\n\t\t\tprotected void after() {\n\t\t\t\tmyServer.disconnect();\n\t\t\t};\n\t\t};\n\t}\n\n### TestRule ###\n\nIn JUnit 4.9, fields that can be annotated with either `@Rule` or `@ClassRule`\nshould be of type `TestRule`.  The old `MethodRule` type, which only made sense\nfor method-level rules, will still work, but is deprecated.\n\nMost built-in Rules have been moved to the new type already, in a way that\nshould be transparent to most users.  `TestWatchman` has been deprecated,\nand replaced by `TestWatcher`, which has the same functionality, but implements\nthe new type.\n\n`TestRule` is an abstract base class, and its abstract `apply` method is\nprotected.  In order to apply `TestRule`s to a `Statement`, use the `RunRules`\nclass in `org.junit.rules` (thanks to `@kcooney`)\n\n### LICENSE checked in ###\n\nThe Common Public License that JUnit is released under is now included\nin the source repository.\n\n### Bug fixes ###\n\n- github#98: assumeTrue() does not work with expected exceptions\n- github#74: Categories + Parameterized\n\n  In JUnit 4.8.2, the Categories runner would fail to run correctly\n  if any contained test class had a custom Runner with a structure\n  significantly different from the built-in Runner.  With this fix,\n  such classes can be assigned one or more categories at the class level,\n  and will be run correctly.  Trying to assign categories to methods within\n  such a class will flag an error.\n\n- github#163: Bad comparison failure message when using\nassertEquals(String, String)\n\n  Thanks to `@kcooney`\n\n### Minor changes ###\n\n- Backed out unused folder &quot;experimental-use-of-antunit&quot;, replaced by\n  bash-based script at build_tests.sh\n\n- Made MultipleFailureException public, to assist extension writers.\n  Thanks to `@kcooney`\n\n",
