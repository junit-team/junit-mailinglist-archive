Apologies in advance if not.\n\nI am developing a Java application which needs to automate user GUI \ninteraction with an existing\nJava-based GUI app.  THe app runs continuously and its GUI appearance \nis not predictable (different GUIs\nmay appear during different runs of the app).  That said, the GUIs \nare fairly simple with most having an\n&quot;OK&quot; or &quot;Cancel&quot; button.  My quesiton is:\n\n1)WOuld using Java GUI Testing tools be a viable option for this \ntask?  I don&#39;t know enough about them\nto judge right off.  My final applicaiton would need to run as a \nstandalone app but also with the capability of an external user\nto start and stop the app.  I looked into using the Java Robot class \nbut it seems like it would lock the mouse/keyboard in the case\nof an app like mine which will run continuously.\n\n2)If the answer to the quesiton above is yes..which Java GUI tool \nwould be most suitable for this task?\n\nThanks in advance.\n\n-D\n\n\n\n",
