Now the user interface is staticly<br/>\nbuilt, but I&#39;m sure someone is doing something about<br/>\nthat.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers,<br/>\n- Ole<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- &quot;James P.

But, in the<br/>\n&gt; spirit of our mythical <br/>\n&gt; programmer who writes her code and then presses the<br/>\n&gt; &#39;Generate Tests&#39; <br/>\n&gt; button; it would not be unlikely for the entire<br/>\n&gt; package to have 5000 <br/>\n&gt; tests generated. This is great - we want lots of<br/>\n&gt; tests - provided we <br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t have to go through all the passing tests to<br/>\n&gt; see which are <br/>\n&gt; correctly testing invalid code. Clearly she is going<br/>\n&gt; to do incremental <br/>\n&gt; build and test, but all those tests have to be<br/>\n&gt; looked at eventually. <br/>\n&gt; That is why I proposed the guidance to tell the test<br/>\n&gt; generator &#39;I don&#39;t <br/>\n&gt; care what I actually wrote, this is what the code is<br/>\n&gt; supposed to do.&#39; <br/>\n&gt; With the inclusion of that kind of guidance, the<br/>\n&gt; 100% testing with zero <br/>\n&gt; (programmer) effort may be possible.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;  &gt; This fits well with the notion that testing is<br/>\n&gt; about<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; good design.<br/>\n&gt;  &gt;<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; Good design is easy to validate by the developer.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; On an academic note, are you sure that &quot;good design<br/>\n&gt; is easy to <br/>\n&gt; validate&quot;?  I&#39;ve certainly been in some animated<br/>\n&gt; discussions in which it <br/>\n&gt; was hard to reach agreement :-)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Thanks,<br/>\n&gt; Jim<br/>\n&gt; -- <br/>\n&gt; James P.
