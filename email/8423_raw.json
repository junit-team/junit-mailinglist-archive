I =\r\nhad unit tested any function (this was c++ code) that I touched and first-g=\r\neneration functions that I called. When it came time to go to integration t=\r\nesting there was not one single integration test that my code did not pass.=\r\n Since the unit test already tested that I conformed to published API requi=\r\nrements.\n\nGiven the fact that (at least at that job) unit testing involved =\r\nonly the programmer making the code changes - and integration testing invol=\r\nved the testers, all of the programmers - project leaders - and finally dep=\r\nartment managers. Every failed integration test was very expensive.\n\tFailed=\r\n integration tests were even more expensive since half the department were =\r\nhourly contractors and testers worked second shift. So, all failed tests as=\r\n time was running out involved bringing multiple programmers back into work=\r\n to fix the problem (which caused regressing testing on any other integrati=\r\non tests the code might touch). Small, early, and very localized testing wi=\r\nll remove the large number of regression tests that must be run.\n\nNow, if o=\r\nnly I can get my current employer to work with unit testing, heck at this p=\r\noint I would just like to get a design documents rather than the &quot;task of t=\r\nhe day&quot;, reboot everything type of system we survive under now. Once I get =\r\nthat I can talk to them about the need for source control.\n\n\nChip\n-----\nPro=\r\ngramming: Its not just a job - its an indenture \n\n\n-----Original Message---=\r\n--\nFrom: Kevin Klinemeier [mailto:zipwow@...]\nSent: Friday, June 20, =\r\n2003 12:53 PM\nTo: junit@yahoogroups.com\nSubject: Re: [junit] Unit Testing v=\r\ns Integration Testing\n\n\nMike,\n\nI think that they&#39;re both valuable (and nece=\r\nssary), mostly because they\ntest different things.\n\nMy unit tests guarantee=\r\n that the small parts of my code work the way I\nexpect them to, and enforce=\r\n the contracts of the API I&#39;m providing.  I\ncan test code that interacts wi=\r\nth other systems even before those other\nsystems exist, so long as we&#39;ve de=\r\nfined their API.  Its important,\nhowever, to limit the scope of your unit t=\r\nests to things that *you* are\nresponsible for.  If you miss that, you&#39;ll en=\r\nd up writing\nunit-integration tests, that I find become unwieldy fairly qui=\r\nckly.\n\nWhat I&#39;ve noticed in my integration testing is that now that I use u=\r\nnit\ntests, finding the actual problems that crop up during integration\ntest=\r\ning takes much less time.  Whereas before all I knew was &quot;the\nwebpage does =\r\nNOT appear&quot; and I had a forest of reasons why that could\nbe, now I know fro=\r\nm my unit tests that large parts of the system are\nworking, and the problem=\r\n must be somewhere in the &#39;seams&#39;.\n\nActually, I&#39;d say that leads me to the =\r\nopposite of your hunch that &quot;the\ncost-per-bug-eliminated of unit testing is=\r\n higher than that of\nintegration testing&quot;, because there&#39;s generally a long=\r\n period of time\nin the integration test between bug discovery and bug repai=\r\nr, where in\nmy unit tests, its quite small.  I suppose I&#39;d also disagree th=\r\nat the\ntwo take the same amount of time to construct, as I&#39;m a true believe=\r\nr\n(tm) that writing unit tests at the same time as your code takes the\nsame=\r\n time as writing your code without unit tests and testing by hand. \nIn both=\r\n those cases you still have to go through integration tests when\nyou&#39;re don=\r\ne.\n\nLastly, the advantages in cleanup of your API (if it isn&#39;t easlity\ntest=\r\nable, it may not be easily usable) are, to me at least, very real\nand signi=\r\nficant.\n\nJust to be clear, I still integration test, too.  It just tends to=\r\n go\nsmoother, and I have better knowledge of where the problem is.\n\nThis ob=\r\nviously wasn&#39;t a scientific study paper, but hopefully its a\nhelpful perspe=\r\nctive.\n\nKevin\n\n--- Mike Bresnahan &lt;java-junit@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; I have =\r\nexperience with integration testing but not much with unit\n&gt; testing.\n&gt; I&#39;v=\r\ne been reading up on unit testing  (e.g. mock objects, test first\n&gt; develop=\r\nment).  However, I have not found an article that explains the\n&gt; advantages=\r\n of unit testing vs integration testing.  My perhaps naive\n&gt; hunch\n&gt; is tha=\r\nt the cost-per-bug-eliminated of unit testing is higher than\n&gt; that of\n&gt; in=\r\ntegration testing.  It appears this way because a single\n&gt; integration test=\r\n\n&gt; tests a lot more code than a single unit test and takes about the\n&gt; same=\r\n\n&gt; amount of time to construct.  Plus it seems to me that a whole suite\n&gt; o=\r\nf unit\n&gt; tests with 100% code coverage cannot guarantee that even the simpl=\r\nest\n&gt; system\n&gt; wide behavior is correct (e.g. the web page appears).  Am I =\r\nwrong\n&gt; about\n&gt; this?  Can someone refer me information about this topic.  =\r\nA\n&gt; scientific\n&gt; study paper with real numbers would be welcome.\n&gt; \n&gt; Mike =\r\nBresnahan\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nSBC Yahoo!
