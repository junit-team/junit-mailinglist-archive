You must\n&gt; carefully\n&gt;     create the unit tests performed by JUnit to\n&gt; ensure\n&gt;     that the tests rigorously check the code just as\n&gt; it\n&gt;     would run in the real world. In this article, we\n&gt; first\n&gt;     look at how to create unit tests and then at how\n&gt; to put\n&gt;     together test suites.\n&gt; \n&gt; Maybe I&#39;m being overly sensitive but it almost\n&gt; sounds like\n&gt; &quot;Here is a complicated thing that I&#39;m going to\n&gt; explain to you&quot;\n&gt; rather than &quot;Creating GOOD test cases is always\n&gt; tough. JUnit\n&gt; helps by giving a framework where all you have to\n&gt; think about\n&gt; is what you want to test...&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;/vent&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Richard.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
