That way you have many small test methods which make it\neasier for the reader of the test class to understand your tests. \nPersonally, I don&#39;t consider it a good idea to use the same OUT (object\nunder test) for provoking different exceptions in a sequence since clean\nrecovery from exceptions is often problematic and you might run into\nsubtle variations of your behaviour. \nHowever, sometimes it is crucial to test that another exception does (or\ndoes not) occur after a first one has already been thrown (and handled\nsomehow). In that case\ndo in your test what you would do with your first exception in client\ncode, e.g. catch and ignore it. Then provoke the second exception and\ncheck that it&#39;s being thrown.\n\nJohannes\n\nnataliabello@... wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; Hello!\n&gt; I am testing a method that throws different exceptions.\n&gt; Til the moment i use one testXXX method for each exception, but i\n&gt; would like to know if there is a way to test all the different\n&gt; exceptions in one test method.\n&gt; The problem is that if one of the exceptions fails ( no exception is\n&gt; thrown) the other situations are not tested.\n&gt; Is there any way to do it; some way of collect the results and make\n&gt; the test at the end?? Other ideas?\n&gt; Thanks in advanced!\n&gt; Natalia\n\n",
