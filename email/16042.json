However, for commercial software development, is this<br/>\n still possible ?<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n Although I knew JUnit and other JUnit-based open-source tools for a<br/>\n couple of years, my company and team never really enbrace it. The<br/>\n major reason is Product Managers always want to add cool features to<br/>\n the system quickly while programmers find the schedule is always too<br/>\n tight to spend any extra time to write testing. <br/>\n <br/>\n I know from the mail list and books that we can take lots of advantage<br/>\n of JUnit-based testing, I myself have no real hands-on experience on<br/>\n it. So here are my questions: <br/>\n <br/>\n * Will Junit-based testing make the project time longer or shorter ?<br/>\n Any hard statistic data ? ( Here I mean commercial project rather than<br/>\n open-source project. )<br/>\n <br/>\n * One intersting point I found is that after Junit-based testing is<br/>\n introduced, programmers tend to use IDE debugger much less than<br/>\n before.  This would save lots of time. Is that true ?<br/>\n <br/>\n * Some guys say JUnit is good for biz / util code testing. But for web<br/>\n application development, where HTML/javascript would be root cause of<br/>\n lots of bugs, Junit is not so powerful. Any comments ? <br/>\n <br/>\n * How can I convince managers and programmers that JUnit-based is<br/>\n really possible for commercial software development ? Any differnece<br/>\n from open-source projects ?<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n  <br/>\n Can some Junit gurus shed some light here ?<br/>\n <br/>\n Thanks, <br/>\n - Frank<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n             <br/>\n<br/>\n        SPONSORED LINKS   <br/>\n                                                    Basic programming language                                       C programming language                                       Computer programming languages                                                                     The c programming language                                       C   programming language                                       List of programming languages                                                                 <br/>\n      <br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\n   YAHOO!
