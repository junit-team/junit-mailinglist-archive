Please allow me to\n&gt; &gt; illustrate my =\r\nquestion with a simple example.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;ve got a class called Coordinate =\r\nthat represents a point in a 3D\n&gt; &gt; coordinate system. I&#39;ve overloaded the =\r\ntoString method of this class\n&gt; &gt; to write out the X, Y, and Z values of th=\r\ne coordinate in a simple\n&gt; &gt; String. Now I want to test my toString method =\r\nusing JUnit.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; If the Coordinate.toString test method fails (because =\r\nthe string was\n&gt; &gt; not constructed in the correct format) I would like to p=\r\nrovide the\n&gt; &gt; programmer running the test with a copy of the incorrect str=\r\ning, since\n&gt; &gt; it provides valuable clues about what is broken with the met=\r\nhod under\n&gt; &gt; test. I typically do this by placing System.err.println state=\r\nments in\n&gt; &gt; my test method. However, I realize that using System.err.print=\r\nln isn&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; the most portable or elegant way to provide this information t=\r\no the\n&gt; &gt; programmer executing the test.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; What I really want is a GU=\r\nI that allows the programmer to select a\n&gt; &gt; failed test from a list of fai=\r\nled tests, and then to view supplemental\n&gt; &gt; test data I provide him/her.\n&gt;=\r\n &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I was thinking I could do this by completing the following tasks:\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; - Implementing the RunListener interface in JUnit.\n&gt; &gt; - Create an ex=\r\ntension of Exception that could contain a HashMap of\n&gt; &gt; simple parameters =\r\nand that would be passed to the constructor of a\n&gt; &gt; Failure object from wi=\r\nthin a test.\n&gt; &gt; - Creating Failure objects in my tests that contain the su=\r\npplemental\n&gt; &gt; failrure data.\n&gt; &gt; - Passing these failure objects to my Run=\r\nListener implementaiton.\n&gt; &gt; - Creating a FailureProcessor class that displ=\r\nays a GUI with the\n&gt; &gt; information in my RunListener implemenation to show =\r\nthe programmer\n&gt; &gt; executing my tests the supplemental failure data as desc=\r\nribed above.\n&gt; &gt; (FailureProcessor would be an interface so that you could =\r\ndo different\n&gt; &gt; things with the supplemental failure data, not just show i=\r\nt in a GUI.)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Before I begin this work, I wanted to ask if there was=\r\n a better way to\n&gt; &gt; do this. I know I could use a logging framework from w=\r\nithin my test\n&gt; &gt; method, but I really want to work within the JUnut framew=\r\nork, not\n&gt; &gt; outside of it. I also want a nice little GUI, not a log file.\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; How are other programmers handling instances when they want to disp=\r\nlay\n&gt; &gt; supplemental data on failed tests? Does my approach sound reasonabl=\r\ne?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The Sunburned Surveyor\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; -----------------------------=\r\n-------\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Yahoo!
