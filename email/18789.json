And, by<br/>\n&gt; practiced I mean, SERIOUSLY practiced.  I talk with a lot of groups who<br/>\n&gt; say they *do* unit testing but have just a handful of test, rarely run,<br/>\n&gt; and no consistency, idea of code coverage, etc.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I gave talks on JUnit and the developer testing revolution at two<br/>\n&gt; JavaOne conferences (2004 and 2006) where I talked about the three<br/>\n&gt; possible outcomes for the future of developer/unit testing:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Long-Term Defeat:  Theidea of developer testing was a noble, notable,<br/>\n&gt; but ultimately short-lived blipin the history of software development.<br/>\n&gt; Almost all developers went back to the old way of thinking: testing<br/>\n&gt; isfor QA.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Minor Victory: Developer testing does not disappear, but it remains a<br/>\n&gt; nicheactivity.  Practiced only by a devoutminority of test-infected<br/>\n&gt; developers.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Major Victory: Developer testing becomes a standardsoftware development<br/>\n&gt; practice.  The rule,instead of the exception.  Releasingsoftware without<br/>\n&gt; unit/developer testing is as unthinkable as releasing softwarewithout<br/>\n&gt; QA.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I am rooting, of course, for the major victory, but I am starting to<br/>\n&gt; have my doubts, and wondering why progress is so slow.  Below is my<br/>\n&gt; analysis of what I believe is happening and I&#39;d be very interested in<br/>\n&gt; your opinion.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; In the past few years, I&#39;ve noticed that some developers are easily<br/>\n&gt; &quot;test-infected&quot;, others require longer exposure and some encouragement<br/>\n&gt; but eventually &quot;get it&quot; , and one group seems to have a built-in<br/>\n&gt; immunity.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; It&#39;s as if there are 3 basic types of test genes:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; T1 - Very susceptpible to test infection.  Show them a single JUnit<br/>\n&gt; example and they get it immediately - and start using it regularly and<br/>\n&gt; with great fervor.  When time pressure hits, they fight hard for enough<br/>\n&gt; time to test and would rather quit than produce code without tests. <br/>\n&gt; They often have framed pictures of Kent Beck on their desk :-).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; T2 - Somewhat susceptible to test infection.  Show them how to use<br/>\n&gt; JUnit/TDD, give them some encouragement and time to appreciate the<br/>\n&gt; benefits and rewards; eventually they will become regular users.  When<br/>\n&gt; time pressure hits, however, they often revert to no-test mode without<br/>\n&gt; too much kicking and screaming.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; T3 -  Immune to test infection. There&#39;s no amount of showing and<br/>\n&gt; convincing that will get them to practice developer testing on their own<br/>\n&gt; with any regularity - if at all.  Many of them would rather quit than<br/>\n&gt; have to write tests on a regular basis.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I would love to be able to say that these genes are somewhat evenly<br/>\n&gt; distributed.  A rough Gaussian distribution.  Something like this:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; T1: 30%<br/>\n&gt; T2: 40%<br/>\n&gt; T3: 30%<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; But my experience is that developers with the T3 gene outnumber the<br/>\n&gt; combined number of those with T2 and T1 gene.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; This spells trouble because I have also found that when developers<br/>\n&gt; become managers they bring with them their attitudes toward developer<br/>\n&gt; testing.  And a T3 manager is not going to provide an environment where<br/>\n&gt; the T2 (the ones that require some time and encouragement) can become<br/>\n&gt; test infected.   And this might explain why developer testing is still<br/>\n&gt; practiced by a minority of developers in a minority of organizations.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Feedback?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Alberto<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.junitfactory.com\">http://www.junitfactory.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Generate JUnit tests.
