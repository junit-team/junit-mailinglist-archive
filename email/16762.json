For example, Kevin Lawrence at Agitar used Agitator to<br/>\nfind a bug in the JUnit Money example code that had sat there undiscovered<br/>\nfor seven years. Another valuable part of Agitar&#39;s toolset is the Management<br/>\nDashboard which gives you a view of the quality of your tests (it&#39;s not just<br/>\nfor managers). I ran the tests for Spider through the Dashboard and learned<br/>\nabout holes in my testing technique--that was the moment that convinced me<br/>\nto join Agitar (I work there one day a week).<br/>\n<br/>\nSincerely yours,<br/>\n<br/>\nKent Beck<br/>\nThree Rivers Institute and Agitar Software<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a>] On <br/>\n&gt; Behalf Of davek725<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Friday, May 26, 2006 7:50 AM<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: [junit] JUnit vs. Agitator<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; My company is currently doing TDD and using JUnit for our unit <br/>\n&gt; testing - both persistence testing and business logic testing.  We <br/>\n&gt; are now looking at Agitator and trying to determine if, and how, it <br/>\n&gt; fits into our current practices.  I was wondering how others have <br/>\n&gt; decided to use Agitator (or not use it).  Some of the issues we are <br/>\n&gt; struggling with:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 1.  Agitator looks like it can eliminate the need to write most JUnit <br/>\n&gt; tests (except true persistence testing).  The downside is that we <br/>\n&gt; would be left with only Agitator config files that contain our <br/>\n&gt; business logic assertions.  This seems like a big leap to take, given <br/>\n&gt; that if Agitar goes away, we have no JUnit.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 2.  Agitator mocks and factories look easy to create, but look like <br/>\n&gt; they are only useful in the context of Agitator.  I couldn&#39;t use them <br/>\n&gt; for other purposes (e.g. Fitnesse, JUnit).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 3.  Having my business logic tests in JUnit means they are in an <br/>\n&gt; understood format and things such as inputs and expected results are <br/>\n&gt; clearly visible and grouped with each test.  My impression of <br/>\n&gt; Agitator is that this wouldn&#39;t be as clear. </span></blockquote></div>",
