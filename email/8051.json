To clarify, to load a license, I <br/>\n&gt; would need to have a saved license. The load license would then verify<br/>\n&gt; that the information that was saved was loaded correctly.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe problem is saving, then loading, then verifying that the loaded<br/>\nobject is equal to what was saved (if I understand your reasoning<br/>\ncorrectly) just tests that they you can load what you saved.  It<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t verify that the format is correct.  Also, the two ate tied<br/>\ntogether.<br/>\n<br/>\nI advise a separate test for each (&quot;advise&quot; because you don&#39;t work for<br/>\nme.. if you did, I&#39;d &quot;insist&quot;).  And don&#39;t use real files if you can<br/>\nhelp it.  Use a mocked file for each test.  Save to a mock that knows<br/>\nwhat *should* be saved, then verify that that is what was saved.  Read<br/>\nfrom a fake that will supply a serialized object in the correct<br/>\nformat, then verify that the loaded object is correct.  If you&#39;re<br/>\nusing Java you can work work with streams and not worry about files at<br/>\nall.  If the output format is textual (i.e. not binary) you can simply<br/>\nsupply string streams in the test... Mocks can result in cleaner test<br/>\ncode, though.<br/>\n<br/>\nYour milage may vary.<br/>\n<br/>\nDave </span></blockquote></div>",
