Most of them are, as Mike indicates,<br/>\nbare of method-level javadoc, the test name suffices.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor the tests that involve business logic, sometimes.  The case I&#39;m<br/>\ntesting is sometimes complex enough that it&#39;s difficult to tell which<br/>\ninformation is related to the condition I&#39;m testing, and which data is<br/>\n&#39;required&#39; data, but has no affect on the unit under test.  For those<br/>\ntests, a word or two about just what the heck is going on is very<br/>\nhelpful, even when the test name is 80 characters long.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe wide majority of tests are undocumented and simple, which is the<br/>\nway I think it should be.  But when you need it, you really need it.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Kevin<br/>\n<br/>\nOn Wed, 05 Jan 2005 14:41:42 -0500, J. B.

When I&#39;ve<br/>\n&gt; done it in the past, I&#39;ve found that the Javadocs merely restate the<br/>\n&gt; code in English, and those are the kinds of comments I find useless,<br/>\n&gt; even distracting.<br/>\n&gt; --<br/>\n&gt; J.
