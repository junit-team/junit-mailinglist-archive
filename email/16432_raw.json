There is no question\n&gt; t=\r\nhat EasyMock is, well, easier. (It&#39;s in the name after all.) But\n&gt; readabil=\r\nity and refactorability of the code is not the only factor in\n&gt; determining=\r\n which is better. I think you&#39;re forgotten that jMock has\n&gt; more features a=\r\nnd flexibility than (at least) EasyMock 1.x. (I could be\n&gt; wrong, because I=\r\n haven&#39;t touched EasyMock since early 2004.)\n\nJust to clarify, I&#39;m not usin=\r\ng EasyMock, I&#39;m using rMock the only\nthing I can compare is a record/play f=\r\nramework to a declare framework\nsuch as jMock.\n\nI have not worked actively =\r\nwith EasyMock enough to have an opinion, I\nhave read the documentation and =\r\nlooked at the examples, in the 2.0\nonline documentation it is a bit more em=\r\nphasized how to extend it but\nif focuses mainly on the new 1.5 features, in=\r\n the 2.0 documentation I\nrecognized more things from jMock in EasyMock but =\r\nI don&#39;t know if they\nhave always been there and are just brought more to my=\r\n attention now.\nIt is possible that I would like jMock more than EasyMock, =\r\ni picked\njMock over EasyMock once upon a time espesially after reading the\n=\r\njMock vs EasyMock comparison on the jMock site.\n\nAt the moment I am using a=\r\nnd developing rMock 2.0. In terms of\nflexibility and readability I have wha=\r\nt I need there, some things are\nmore flexible than jMock some things are le=\r\nss flexible but imo it is\natleast as readable.\n\nThe featureset and clairity=\r\n of rMock suits me but that is not a big\nsurprise since I participate in it=\r\ns development. I espesially like\nthat all tests tend to have the same struc=\r\nture in rMock (this is\ndriven by the fact that rMock allows _less_ flexibil=\r\nity in this area\nthan both Easymock and jMock).\n\nOne of the things I do val=\r\nue most with record/play frameworks is the\nability to ctrl+space your inter=\r\nfaces from your tests. The refactoring\npart is not _as_ important once the =\r\ninterface has settled a bit but\nstill nice. I understand your point about t=\r\nhe niceness of not having\nto specify the methods before you have settled on=\r\n them better after\nyour last mail,  at least when you are extending existin=\r\ng interfaces\n(that already have some implementations). I still prefer the a=\r\nblity to\ncomplete my methods it has become a natural way to wiork for me, i=\r\nn\nthis case i think it boils down to personal preferences.\n\nAll the best\n/J=\r\noakim Ohlrogge\n\n",
