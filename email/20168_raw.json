You can check that out for this\npurpose i =\r\nguess. \n\nIt has features to load the test data in the form of Excel sheet a=\r\nnd\nalso contains features to compare the results against actual DB data. \n\n=\r\nhttp://dbunit.sourceforge.net/\n\nRegards,\nSarat.\n\n\n--- In junit@yahoogroups.=\r\ncom, &quot;Mike Foley&quot; &lt;mike_foley_01612@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi Lasse,\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks f=\r\nor your response.  Yes, you are right.  I suppose that is \n&gt; it...I want to=\r\n verify the rows in the spreadsheet against the rows in \n&gt; that table....an=\r\nd report on any inconsistencies.  That would do it.\n&gt; \n&gt; Testing the applic=\r\nation...written in Java/J2EE, exposed as Axis web \n&gt; services...I am comfor=\r\ntable writing JUnit or Cactus tests in that \n&gt; context.  I guess the new ch=\r\nallenge ... for me ... is the Excel \n&gt; spreadsheet.  How do I get at it fro=\r\nm Java APIs?  I will do some \n&gt; online research and googling into that....o=\r\nr listen to any ideas from \n&gt; this group on how to go about that.\n&gt; \n&gt; And =\r\nthen the JDBC calls to the table...I think I can figure that out. \n&gt; \n&gt; Thi=\r\ns whole thing...spreadsheet rows comparison to database table....I \n&gt; think=\r\n I can re-use this pattern in several places.  I will keep the \n&gt; group upd=\r\nated as I make progress if there is interest.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks for your help,\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; Mike  \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In junit@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Lasse Koskela&quot; &lt;l=\r\nasse.koskela@&gt; \n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Hi Mike,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; On Dec 12, 2007 10:47 PM=\r\n, Mike Foley &lt;mike_foley_01612@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  I guess my problem statement=\r\n is this: the business analysts have \n&gt; an\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  Excel spreadsheet with hu=\r\nndreds of rows...each row defines some \n&gt; unique\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  requirement on the =\r\nway this particular thing is supposed to \n&gt; work.
