Other\nresearch projects have prevented me from becoming more involved with Joshua\ndevelopment. Anyone interested in collaborating on the development of a new\nversion of Joshua over the summer?\n\nIn light of all this: it appears like Joshua is really not going to be \nbeneficial to the point in question.  Joshua is used if you want to distribute\nthe execution of test suites.  It is not particularly suited if you want to \nactually test a distributed application.  \n\nWhen I am testing complicated distributed systems, I sometimes move away from \na test automation framework.  Instead, I configure my distributed services to \nprovide logging information (a la log4j or some other tool), and then conduct \ndifferent types of manual tests.  Or, I might use a test automation tool to \nexecute a series of test sequences and then investigate the logs manually.  I \nhave found that the usage of fault-injection on a distributed system often \nhelps me to understand system behavior in off-nominal situations.\n\nIf you believe some of the contributors on the Jini-Users mailing list, they\nthink that they do not need to test their applications if they use Jini (grin).\nI would point you to the links, but the online archive appears to be down:\n\nhttp://archives.java.sun.com/cgi-bin/wa?A0=jini-users&D=1\n\ngreg\n\n-- \nGregory M.
