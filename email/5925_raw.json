Likewise, there are people who earn their\nliving writing books and consulting around open source tools, or use open\nsource tools in one way or another to promote their own ventures. For\nexample, &quot;The Coad Letter: Test-driven Development Edition, issue 102:\nJUnit&quot; written by yourself asks that the reader &quot;consider Saorsa&#39;s intensive\n5-day, Hands-on TDD course taught by Dave Astels.&quot; I assume you are not\ngiving this course away for free.\n\nIn the case of Enhanced JUnit, it is a little strange because we are\nactually grafting some functionality that already exists in an enterprise\ntesting tool (Test Mentor) onto JUnit. There is actually more code (and\nfunctionality) in the add-on than JUnit.\n\nI hope this helps, Mike\n\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\nMike Silverstein\nSilverMark, Inc.\nThe object testing company\nhttp://www.javatesting.com\n\n\n",
