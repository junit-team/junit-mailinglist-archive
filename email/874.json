That is if test &quot;basic1&quot; doesn&#39;t pass, don&#39;t even expect <br/>\ntest &quot;lessbasic1&quot; and test &quot;lessbasic2&quot; to pass. For example, in the <br/>\nMoneyTest example in the &quot;Junit cookbook&quot;, testMoneyEquals is very basic and <br/>\nif that one fails, many tests will also fail. What my idea is about is *not* <br/>\nrelated to ordering the execution of the tests themselves. (I personnally <br/>\nbelieve they should de order-independant, the runners could even run them in <br/>\na random order to ensure developpers make them independant.) The idea is <br/>\nabout ordering the *test results*.<br/>\n<br/>\nI personnally hate when suddenly 20 tests fails and I have to inspect all of <br/>\nthat ouput to know where is possibly the problem. I would like an <br/>\nerror/failure in testMoneyEquals() to show *first* in the output. How to <br/>\nimplement this? The test writer could somehow specify a &quot;level&quot; for each <br/>\ntest (basic, mid, complex). That could be totally optionnal and thus not <br/>\nchange the current API. That would be *just a hint* from the test writer to <br/>\nthe person running the tests saying &quot;hey, look there first&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nPersonnally I&#39;m not even sure it&#39;s worth it, but I wanted to share that idea <br/>\nwith people on the list.<br/>\n<br/>\nMathieu<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: Mike Clark Reply-To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a> To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n&gt;Subject: Re: AW: [junit] Ordered execution of test cases Date: Mon, 2 Apr <br/>\n&gt;2001 07:16:49 -0700 (PDT)<br/>\n </span></blockquote>[...]<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Agreed. They are executed in this order only because the underlying <br/>\n&gt;collection is ordered - an implementation detail not to be depended upon. I <br/>\n&gt;also agree that tests should be independent; however, the original poster <br/>\n&gt;was aware of these recommendations and willing to accept the implications.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Mike<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;===== Mike Clark Clarkware Consulting, Inc.
