Especially if your tests require two or three<br/>\n&gt; statements to set up in the test method (not in setUp()), in which case<br/>\n&gt; there is even more to be gained to run more than one assert so you don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; have to duplicate this code in other test methods.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I see many people misunderstand the message of &quot;one assert per test&quot;. <br/>\nIt&#39;s not important to have precisely one assert per test, but it is <br/>\ngenerally wise to avoid doing this:<br/>\n<br/>\narrange<br/>\nact<br/>\nassert<br/>\nact some more<br/>\nassert some more<br/>\nact some more<br/>\nassert some more<br/>\n<br/>\nLet me emphasize that this is /generally/ unwise. Not always so. (I <br/>\nusually split this into three separate tests.)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Also, the fix you show in your documentation is simplistic.  What if the<br/>\n&gt; code to be extracted is specific to that test method?  If you move it to<br/>\n&gt; setUp(), you are suddenly charging *all* the other test methods of that same<br/>\n&gt; class with this set up cost that they have no need for.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Also, it seems to me your recommended pattern for code that must throw an<br/>\n&gt; exception (&quot;don&#39;t catch it and declare the exception in the throws<br/>\n&gt; statement&quot;) goes against common practice.  Plus, it will cause JUnit to<br/>\n&gt; report an Error instead of a Failure, although this distinction is<br/>\n&gt; thankfully going away with JUnit4.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; A more common way to address this problem is to catch the exception and do a<br/>\n&gt; fail().<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t quite understand this. If the test expects the exception, then <br/>\nwe usually catch it and /don&#39;t/ fail; but if the test doesn&#39;t expect the <br/>\nexception, then we usually throw it up into JUnit and let it report the <br/>\nerror.<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJ.
