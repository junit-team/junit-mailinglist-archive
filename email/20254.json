And implement the actual business logic<br/>\n&gt;  in normal Java classes.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is how I do it and it works very well.  It enforces a clear<br/>\nseparation between application logic, which is written as normal<br/>\nobject-oriented code, and the J2EE technology.  That keeps all the<br/>\nawkward design issues of the J2EE framework well outside the<br/>\napplication.  The classes that refer to the J2EE framework are just an<br/>\nadapter layer between the transaction management of the app container<br/>\nand the objects of the application itself.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt means that you can easily test the application code in plain JUnit<br/>\n(and jMock).<br/>\n<br/>\nYou&#39;ll need end-to-end tests to ensure that the adapter layer works as<br/>\nexpected.  But you have those already, I expect.<br/>\n<br/>\n--Nat </span></blockquote></div>",
