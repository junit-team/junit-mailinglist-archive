If i just start unit-testing and as a result of that deliv=\r\ner\nbetter code faster, hopefully the better quality will be evident and spe=\r\nak\nfor itself.\n\nWe make so many descisions we don&#39;t ask permission for like=\r\n &quot;is it ok to\nremove this dead code?, can I use a factory here?,\ncan I draw=\r\n a UML-diagram on the whiteboard?, can I save it in\ndocumentation?, can I c=\r\nall a designmeeting?&quot; so why is unit-testing\ndifferent?\n\nI think, if you ma=\r\nnage to convince your team /first/ then management is as\ngood as convinced =\r\nwhen the results start showing.\nI think by example is the best way to go, s=\r\ntart with your self and influence\nthose around you.\n\n/if/ you are convinced=\r\n about the benefits of unittesting then /not/ doing\nunittesting would be un=\r\nprofessional since you choose not to do it.\nSo start doing it and infect th=\r\ne others. Don&#39;t have managment inject the\nvirus into an unwilling team by p=\r\nlacing demands on testcoverage etc.\nThat will rebound in my experience.\n\nSo=\r\n, what do you think? Should we tell the story to our fellow developers\ninst=\r\nead of management?\n/J\n\nOn 10/2/06, Bob Runstein &lt;rrunstein@...&gt; wrote:\n=\r\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Here&#39;s an approach I&#39;ve tried to convince management of the\n&gt; benefit=\r\n of object level unit tests. I don&#39;t know if it has worked\n&gt; yet, and I wel=\r\ncome suggestions to improve it.\n&gt; The Software Inferno\n&gt;\n&gt; It can be diffic=\r\nult to convince people the value of unit tests. As Paul\n&gt; Wheaton says in h=\r\nis article &quot;Evil Unit Tests&quot;\n&gt; http://www.javaranch.com/journal/200603/Jour=\r\nnal200603.jsp#a1\n&gt; &lt;http://www.javaranch.com/journal/200603/Journal200603.j=\r\nsp#a1&gt; people\n&gt; are both proud of the fact that they have them and bothered=\r\n by the fact\n&gt; that there is so much work required to create and maintain t=\r\nhem. As\n&gt; Paul states, a Unit Test is &quot;The smallest amount of testable code=\r\n.\n&gt; Often a single method/function, sans the use of other methods or\n&gt; clas=\r\nses.&quot; Methods with multiple paths of execution may require\n&gt; multiple unit =\r\ntests.\n&gt; We don&#39;t need that kind of test\n&gt; Often, opposition to tests at th=\r\nis level is based on the perceived\n&gt; return on investment: the level of eff=\r\nort to create and run them plus\n&gt; ongoing maintenance costs vs. what they a=\r\ndd to delivering the finished\n&gt; application. The argument is often that the=\r\n application as a whole is\n&gt; being delivered so the JUnit tests must test a=\r\npplication functionality,\n&gt; not objects in isolation. In addition, since th=\r\ne functionality of the\n&gt; application will be verified by the Functional Tes=\r\nts performed by a test\n&gt; team and Acceptance Tests witnessed by the Custome=\r\nr, lower level tests\n&gt; are redundant and omitting them allows more value to=\r\n be delivered in the\n&gt; form of more functionality.\n&gt; An Analogy\n&gt; In the 19=\r\n74 production of Irwin Allen&#39;s The Towering Inferno, Paul\n&gt; Newman played a=\r\nn architect who designed a 138 story glass tower for a\n&gt; builder, played by=\r\n William Holden. On the afternoon of the opening\n&gt; celebration the maintena=\r\nnce staff was testing the backup generators and\n&gt; a switch in the power roo=\r\nm erupted in smoke. The architect was called\n&gt; and discovered an overload o=\r\nccurred due to the use of the wrong type of\n&gt; wire. At the same time on an =\r\nupper floor, an overload in an electrical\n&gt; switch box started a fire in a =\r\nutility room. A security guard, played\n&gt; by O.J. Simpson, read a computer w=\r\narning from a heat sensor, but the\n&gt; automatic fire alarm system did not re=\r\ncognize it as a fire and did not\n&gt; notify the fire department. When he late=\r\nr saw the smoke on a video\n&gt; camera, he instructed another guard to call th=\r\ne fire department\n&gt; manually.\n&gt;\n&gt; When the fire department arrived, the fir=\r\ne chief, played by Steve\n&gt; McQueen, asked why the ventilation system did no=\r\nt automatically reverse\n&gt; to remove the smoke and whether the sprinkler sys=\r\ntem was working. The\n&gt; architect informed him that neither was working on t=\r\nhe floor with the\n&gt; fire and he did not know why.\n&gt;\n&gt; The story revealed th=\r\nat the builder needed to cut $4 million from\n&gt; construction costs and had d=\r\nemanded that $2 million come from the cost\n&gt; of the electrical subsystem. I=\r\nn order to accomplish this, the electrical\n&gt; subcontractor, played by Richa=\r\nrd Chamberlain, changed the\n&gt; architect&#39;s specifications and reduced the ro=\r\nbustness of the\n&gt; electrical system to the minimum that would meet the requ=\r\nirements of the\n&gt; building code. The other $2 million came from cost reduct=\r\nions in other\n&gt; subsystems with potentially similar results.\n&gt;\n&gt; The fire d=\r\nepartment was unable to successfully fight the fire and the\n&gt; architect ult=\r\nimately had to blow up the water tanks on an upper floor to\n&gt; put it out. M=\r\nany people lost their lives and the building was\n&gt; destroyed.\n&gt; Now how doe=\r\ns this relate to software?\n&gt; The glass tower is our application. Paul Newma=\r\nn is the Software\n&gt; Architect who designed the system to provide the functi=\r\nonality desired\n&gt; by William Holden, the Customer. Richard Chamberlain is t=\r\nhe Project\n&gt; Manager who must deliver his portion of the application within=\r\n the\n&gt; Customer&#39;s budget. O.J. Simpson is the Operations and Maintenance\n&gt; =\r\nteam. Steve McQueen is the new developer sent in to fix the problems\n&gt; with=\r\n the application, but finds the problems are so pervasive that he\n&gt; cannot =\r\nsave it and the application has to be rebuilt practically from\n&gt; scratch.\n&gt;=\r\n But the high level tests passed\n&gt; The building passed its Integration Test=\r\ns: Electrical, telephone,\n&gt; elevator, air conditioning, security systems al=\r\nl work.\n&gt;\n&gt; The building passed its Functional Tests: Residents are living =\r\nin the\n&gt; building, business tenants are operating there.\n&gt;\n&gt; The building p=\r\nassed its Acceptance Tests =96 The city inspectors\n&gt; passed all of the syst=\r\nems as meeting the building code.\n&gt; How could disaster have been prevented?=\r\n\n&gt; Many things change once an application is released. Users perform\n&gt; acti=\r\nons and use values untested prior to release. Problems with\n&gt; algorithms an=\r\nd logic due to untested corner cases are revealed. New\n&gt; functionality brea=\r\nks previously working functionality but no one knows\n&gt; this because the pre=\r\nvious functionality had no low level test to reveal\n&gt; the breakage. Many of=\r\n these problems can be tested for with low level\n&gt; unit tests. Examples fro=\r\nm the analogy:\n&gt;\n&gt; assertEquals(&quot;highAmperageConduitWire&quot;, switchbox.getWir=\r\neType);\n&gt;\n&gt; floor.setTemperature(140 degrees);\n&gt;\n&gt; assertTrue(floor.getSpri=\r\nnklerSystem().isWaterFlowing());\n&gt;\n&gt; floor.setSmokePresent(true);\n&gt;\n&gt; asser=\r\ntEquals(&quot;reverse&quot;, ventilation.getDirection());\n&gt;\n&gt; fireAlarmSystem.setHeat=\r\nSensorStatus(&quot;alarm&quot;);\n&gt;\n&gt; assertTrue(fireAlarmSystem.fireDepartmentNotifie=\r\nd());\n&gt;\n&gt; Another (shorter) Analogy\n&gt; Pharaoh wants a new pyramid built, bu=\r\nt the straw harvest was poor so the\n&gt; ratio of straw to mud for the bricks =\r\nis cut in half. No one tests\n&gt; whether the new bricks can stand the load. W=\r\nhen the fourth level is\n&gt; reached, the bricks at the base crumble and the p=\r\nyramid collapses.\n&gt; Why is software different?\n&gt; Do automobile manufacturer=\r\ns destroy a car in a crash test without first\n&gt; testing the characteristics=\r\n of the bumper and other related components\n&gt; in isolation from the car?\n&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; Does NASA send up the space shuttle to test the heat properties of the\n&gt; =\r\nceramic tiles that line its surface or are the tiles tested on Earth\n&gt; firs=\r\nt?\n&gt;\n&gt; Your thoughts?\n&gt;\n&gt; Bob\n&gt;\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have b=\r\neen removed]\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed=\r\n]\n\n\n",
