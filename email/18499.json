It has a few quirks and<br/>\nisn&#39;t as popular as JMock but has some interesting<br/>\nfeatures that you might find useful. It seems to have<br/>\nslowed (in terms of active development) in recent times.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers, Paul.<br/>\n<br/>\nDavid Saff wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; On 12/1/06, Jeff Langr &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jeff@...\">jeff@...</a> <br/>\n&gt; &lt;mailto:jeff%40langrsoft.com&gt;&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; I experimented with one of the frameworks a good while ago.

Can you re-post a link<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; to one you recommend?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; All of my experience with any of the public tools has been with JMock.<br/>\n&gt; JMock 1, available from<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://jmock.org\">http://jmock.org</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://jmock.org\">http://jmock.org</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; has both the mocking library and the constraint library, with<br/>\n&gt; assertThat. In the next generation, the constraint library has been<br/>\n&gt; renamed to hamcrest, which is being developed independently:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sourceforge.net/projects/hamcrest\">http://sourceforge.net/projects/hamcrest</a> <br/>\n&gt; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sourceforge.net/projects/hamcrest\">http://sourceforge.net/projects/hamcrest</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; A warning: hamcrest uses (but doesn&#39;t, I believe, require) generic<br/>\n&gt; types. I was one of several users pushing for this, but now that it&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; here, I have mixed feelings about it. I tend to believe the main<br/>\n&gt; issue isn&#39;t the generics themselves, but unnecessarily poor type<br/>\n&gt; inference from current compilers. This is an orthogonal issue, with<br/>\n&gt; the same kinds of benefits and drawbacks that would come from<br/>\n&gt; declaring assertEquals as<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; public &lt;T&gt; void assertEquals(T expected, T actual).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Have fun,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; David Saff<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>",
