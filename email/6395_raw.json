You should be able to write your tests to \nbe independent of one another without sacrificing modularity somewhat \nakin to this example:\n\npublic void testStuff() {\n      create(); // just rename testCreate() to create(), leave all the\n                 // asserts just as they are\n      update();\n      restore();\n      delete();\n}\n\nJust because it&#39;s a method, doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s a test.\n\n-shane\n\nOn Monday, December 9, 2002, at 12:49  PM, Kevin Klinemeier wrote:\n\n&gt; --- Maciej Zawadzki &lt;mbz@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt; For example, if the testCreate() method created an object, I could\n&gt;&gt; store a reference to it  in an instance attribute and access again\n&gt;&gt; from the other test methods (testRestore() for example).\n&gt;\n&gt; I think the reason you&#39;re finding this difficult to do is that its\n&gt; purposefully discouraged by the framework.\n&gt;\n&gt; The paradigm is that tests *must* be independent.  Part of the reason\n&gt; for this is that if one test fails, you can re-run it during your\n&gt; debugging to see if you&#39;ve made progress fixing the problem.\n&gt;\n&gt; If your tests aren&#39;t independent, you&#39;ll have to have some way of\n&gt; documenting which test&#39;s side effect allows your other test(s) to be\n&gt; run.\n&gt;\n&gt; As you point out, though, there&#39;s clearly a cost involved in making\nall\n&gt; your tests independent, and use the &#39;setup() and teardown()&#39; methods.\n&gt; If this cost is prohibitive, you may want to consider changing those\n&gt; tests that are currently separate, interrelated tests to be one\n&gt; independent test.  (I&#39;d to this by renaming your current interrelated\n&gt; test methods to be private helper methods, and have a larger &#39;test&#39;\n&gt; method call them in the order you want).\n&gt;\n&gt; This is the approach I&#39;ve been taking, and its simplified things a\n&gt; great deal both in my own process, and when people use tests I&#39;ve\n&gt; written.\n&gt;\n&gt; -Kevin Klinemeier\n\n\n\nTo unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\njunit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n\n\nYour use of Yahoo!
