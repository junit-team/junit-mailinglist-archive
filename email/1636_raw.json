You may have to wrap JDBC in your own\nshell to provide the integrity checking.\n\nNoboddy should need reminding that whatever it costs, a clean\ndatabase is worth the pain.\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: Jim Cheesman [mailto:jchees@...]\nSent: 22 June 2001 09:58\nTo: junit@yahoogroups.com\nSubject: RE: [junit] Testing Connection Pools\n\n\n\n&gt;For software quality two of the most important things to test for\n&gt;(if you can) are:\n&gt;1. Connections are &#39;clean&#39; when you put them back in the pool.\n&gt;The next piece of code to use the connection should be able to\n&gt;do so without fear of picking up a bad connection or one which\n&gt;wasn&#39;t tidied up properly by the last user.\n\nJust out of interest, (and getting a little OT) is there any way to\ncheck \n(within the code - not as a unit test) that the connection is &quot;clean&quot; -\nie \nResultSets, statements closed etc.?\n\n\n\nJim\n\n\n\n--\n\n                           *   Jim Cheesman   *\n             Trabajo: \njchees@... - (34)(91) 724 9200 x 2360\n              Exaggeration is not \nall it&#39;s cracked up to be.\n\n\n\nTo unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\njunit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n \n\nYour use of Yahoo!
