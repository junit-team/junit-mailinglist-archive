    "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-107445798\">Thanks for the reply, Jeff. I was looking at Spring a little today and<br/>\nnoticed they had a PropertiesFactoryBean. If I can convince my<br/>\nmanagers to let me use Spring I could do something like:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;bean id=&quot;appProperites&quot; class=&quot;package.AppProperties&quot;&gt;<br/>\n   &lt;property name=&quot;source&quot;&gt;<br/>\n      &lt;bean class=&quot;org.springframework...PropertiesFactoryBean&quot;&gt;<br/>\n         &lt;property name=&quot;location&quot;&gt;<br/>\n            &lt;value&gt;classpath:app.properties&lt;/value&gt;<br/>\n         &lt;/property&gt;<br/>\n      &lt;/bean&gt;<br/>\n   &lt;/property&gt;<br/>\n&lt;/bean&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;bean id=&quot;otherBean&quot; class=&quot;MyBean&quot;&gt;<br/>\n   &lt;property name=&quot;appProperties&quot;&gt;<br/>\n      &lt;ref local=&quot;appProperties&quot;/&gt;<br/>\n   &lt;/property&gt;<br/>\n&lt;/bean&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nWith this, your suggestion of injecting the AppProperties into the<br/>\ndependant objects becomes a breeze, making my testing life easier. I<br/>\ncan create a Properties object in my setUp() and set it into the<br/>\nAppProperties, then set the AppProperties into my other objects.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks again for the reply.<br/>\n<br/>\nMichael.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Jeff Grigg&quot; &lt;jeffgrigg@c...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; --- &quot;Michael&quot; &lt;mkoss917@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; [...] a class called AppProperties.

I like the idea of a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; static class to pull application properties from, but it<br/>\n&gt; &gt; makes testing more difficult. I could load the AppProperties<br/>\n&gt; &gt; object in the setUp (that is my solution to get it working<br/>\n&gt; &gt; until I get better suggestions), but it seems like the app<br/>\n&gt; &gt; should be designed a little differently.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The AppProperties methods could use a private static member to do <br/>\n&gt; the detailed work.  And then you could use MockObject, during <br/>\n&gt; testing, to control the static member object&#39;s behavior.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; This can quickly lead to AppProperties being a Singleton.  That&#39;s <br/>\n&gt; OK; the tests can swap in a MockObject in setUp and clear or reset <br/>\n&gt; it on tearDown.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Singleton is not ideal, but it can be refactored later to remove the <br/>\n&gt; Singleton-ness.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; How would something like this be handled in IoC (DI) projects? <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Other objects would accept an AppProperties instance in their <br/>\n&gt; constructor or in a &quot;set&quot; method, and keep it in a local variable.  <br/>\n&gt; You can migrate from Singleton to this pattern, over time. </span></blockquote></div>",
