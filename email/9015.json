[It&#39;s not answered in the FAQ nor in the cook<br/>\nbook etc.] I&#39;ve been using JUnit (and TDD) for a fair while now, but I have a<br/>\nproblem that I&#39;m about 90% sure is mere blindness on my part, but perhaps <br/>\nnot. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe have an interface (Graph) with multiple implementations (A and B). [Some<br/>\nnames have been changed to avoid complications.] I have a test case<br/>\nAbstractTestGraph with an abstract method Graph getGraph(), where the<br/>\ntests test the Graph(s) that getGraph() returns, and TestA/TestB define<br/>\ngetGraph() to return instances of A/B as appropriate. So far, so good, and<br/>\njust as suggested in one of the Junit documents. The code for each test<br/>\ncase is nice and short.<br/>\n<br/>\nWell ... I lied about A and B; it&#39;s more like A, B, C, and X. And likely to<br/>\nbe more, since Y and Z exist but may not be properly included in the<br/>\ntest suite at the moment.<br/>\n<br/>\n(1) How can I write a test generator which takes A.class, X.class etc as<br/>\narguments and constructs the necessary suite? The obvious-to-me code<br/>\n<br/>\n    public static TestCase makeMyTest( final Class someGraph )<br/>\n        {<br/>\n        class TestSomeGraph extends AbstractTestGraph<br/>\n            {<br/>\n            public TestSomeGraph( String name ) { super( name ); }<br/>\n            public static TestSuite suite() { return new TestSuite( <br/>\nTestSomeGraph ); }<br/>\n            public Graph getGraph() <br/>\n                 { return someGraph.getConstructor( new Class[] {} <br/>\n).newInstance( new Object [] {} ); }<br/>\n            }<br/>\n        }<br/>\n<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t work, because TestSomeGraph isn&#39;t public, so junit can&#39;t reflect to <br/>\nit.<br/>\nAnd Java, bless it&#39;s cotton socks, has a hissy fit if you try and make the <br/>\nnested<br/>\nclass public.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd there&#39;s more. Different instances of Graph have differing capabilities, eg<br/>\nsome of them are read-only, some of them handle transactions, etc. I&#39;d<br/>\nlike the test generator to only add those tests that are relevant given the<br/>\nappropriate capabilities. My plan was to arrange that makeMyTest would<br/>\nlook at the current capabilities [which would be set up per-class] and replace<br/>\n`suite` with something that added in just those tests that were needed<br/>\n(refactoring AbstractTestGraph into the subgroups). Since makeMyTest<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t work, I can&#39;t do that either ...<br/>\n<br/>\nSo ... am I dead-ended in the wrong alley? Missing something obvious?<br/>\nMissing something subtle? Any advice would be welcome. If I have to<br/>\nhack junit source code I will, but I feel that surely I don&#39;t need to ...<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nChris &quot;electric hedgehog&quot; Dollin<br/>\nC FAQs at: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.faqs.org/faqs/by-newsgroup/comp/comp.lang.c.html\">http://www.faqs.org/faqs/by-newsgroup/comp/comp.lang.c.html</a><br/>\nC welcome: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.angelfire.com/ms3/bchambless0/welcome_to_clc.html\">http://www.angelfire.com/ms3/bchambless0/welcome_to_clc.html</a></div>",
