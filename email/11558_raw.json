It usually takes a\nnoticeable time to run them all. It is also less\nefficient to do so because it ignores the idea of\nlevelization (from John Lakos&#39; underappreciated book\n&quot;Large Scale C++ Software Design&quot;). In incremental dev\nmode it would be more efficient to execute only the\ntestcases that correspond to the product package(s)\nthat&#39;s just changed (and the dependency closure\nthereof) AND execute them in increasing level numbers\n(reverse package dependency topological order).\n\nIt has been my experience that individual developers\non a team don&#39;t normally pay attention to the concept\nof levelization. In the framework I use I can control\ntestcase ordering via a simple text file and I can\ngroup individual testcases into sub-suites that I can\nalso include/order via the same text syntax. However,\nthis is a very manual process and hard to instill as a\nteam practice.\n\nA tool/framework that enforces test (sub)suite\nexecution in increasing level numbers would seem like\nthe next evolutionary step after naive TDD. Does\nanyone know of such a tool? The testcase-&gt;app package\nassignment could be done by simply placing testcases\nin the relevant package (common practice already\nanyway) or by something like Java 1.5 metadata\ntagging.\n\nThere are tools to analyze existing package\ndependencies, but I am not aware of a test framework\nto actually relate that data to testcase execution\nordering.\n\nReferences:\n\nhttp://www.braithwaite-lee.com/opinions/levelization.html\nhttp://javacentral.compuware.com/pasta/concepts/packageDesign.html\n\nThanks,\nVlad.\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nTired of spam?
