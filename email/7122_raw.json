I think my process is good because I don&#39;t\n&gt; need to consider whether an interface I&#39;m developing now will be\n&gt; workable in the future; I just need to get it to work with what I need\n&gt; now--a much simpler and faster job--and leave it at that. And it&#39;s good\n&gt; for my code because it keeps my code smaller, more easily modifiable,\n&gt; and less likely to have bugs.\n\nIf change is necessary then it is necessary, but in general it is better to\ndesign something right the first time rather than designing something just\ngood enough to get it to work, then having to cosntantly change it because\nyou didn&#39;t plan the interface or design well.\n\nI think we are talking past each other - or at least I hope so. I have\nworked on a lot of legacy code that was designed with the &quot;I just need to\nget it to work&quot; attitude and it was a nightmare to debug, extend, maintain\nand refactor. When I work on such code I often wind up throwing it out and\nwriting it over from scratch - if I am allowed to.\n\nThere is a continuim ranging from writing sloppy code to writing code by\ncommittee and virtually unchangeable specification. Neither extreme is\ndesireable in today&#39;s world, but in general interfaces should be designed\nwith care, an eye for reuse and the future - and after an initial period of\ndiscovery should settle down to be relatively stable and unchanging.\nRefactoring can then go on mostly behind the facade of the interface - at\nthe implementation level where the real work is done.\n\nConstantly changing interfaces are code smells; they smell of poor\nencapsulation and exposure of things that should be hidden behind the\ninterface. They smell of poor design consideration with regards to reuse.\nThey smell of a bad impedance mismatch between various units.\n\nIn short, I assert that a well designed interface should not have to change\nvery often or very much. If you want to go down that old road of constantly\nrewriting and redesigning code under the guise of being &quot;agile&quot; then that is\nyour right. I&#39;ve BTDT and I prefer to spend a little bit extra time up front\ncreating a good design that doesn&#39;t need costant refactoring - in the long\nrun that has worked much better for me.\n\nTo each their own.\n\nFWIW,\nLauren\n\n=====\nhttp://developerdude.mystarband.net\n\n\n\n",
