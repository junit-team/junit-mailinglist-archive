So, framework should provide some way to \nsupply test data lazily.\n\n   From other hand if you think of IDE it should be possible to run \njust specific test or only selected test cases. o, it seems that there \nshould be some random-acess API, which iteterator just does not provide.\n\n   Also note that one would be interested to know how many test cases \nin the given data provider as well as a readable name for each test. \nIn a trivial case name could be a number from the bebinning and in \nless trivial, but quite popular it could be a name of the file with \ntest data or primary key in the database.\n\n   Thanks\n\n   Eugene\n\nPS: Cedric, I thouight we already discussed above points. Did you \nforgot that or my arguments wasn&#39;t very covincing?\n\n\nCédric Beust ♔ wrote:\n&gt; Hi Elliotte,\n&gt; \n&gt; On 10/12/05, Elliotte Harold &lt;elharo@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt;&gt;Cédric Beust ♔ wrote:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;// This method will provide data to any test method that declares that\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;its\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;Data Provider\n&gt;&gt;&gt;// is named &quot;test1&quot;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;@DataProvider(name = &quot;test1&quot;)\n&gt;&gt;&gt;public Object[][] createData1() {\n&gt;&gt;&gt;return new Object[][] {\n&gt;&gt;&gt;new Object[] { &quot;Cedric&quot;, new Integer(36) },\n&gt;&gt;&gt;new Object[] { &quot;Anne&quot;, new Integer(37)},\n&gt;&gt;&gt;};\n&gt;&gt;&gt;}\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;On the plus side, this approach is really, really simple. I&#39;m having\n&gt;&gt;trouble following all the JUnit 4 parameterized discussions simply\n&gt;&gt;because I don&#39;t feel comfortable with Java 5 annotations and generics\n&gt;&gt;yet. I just haven&#39;t worked enough with these java 5 features that they\n&gt;&gt;come to me naturally. By contrast, I can read this and see exactly what\n&gt;&gt;it&#39;s doing. Good.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;On the minus side, I think this might be too simple. It seems to require\n&gt;&gt;all the test parameters to be initialized up front. If the parameters or\n&gt;&gt;their initialization code is large or expensive, this could be a\n&gt;&gt;problem. I would prefer the parameters to be lazily initialized before\n&gt;&gt;each test and torn down after each test. This could be done if this\n&gt;&gt;method returned an Iterator rather than a static array. Any reason it\n&gt;&gt;wasn&#39;t done this way?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; For simplicity.\n&gt; \n&gt; But I understand the need for lazy initializations, and it&#39;s also a feature\n&gt; that has been requested for the creation of test classes themselves, which\n&gt; TestNG doesn&#39;t support either (just like JUnit, TestNG creates all the test\n&gt; classes upfront and then invoke the test methods on them, which doesn&#39;t work\n&gt; well in the cases you outlined).\n&gt; \n&gt; For that reason, I have indeed been considering an iterator factory for test\n&gt; classes as well, which I proposed a few months ago in this thread:\n&gt; \n&gt; http://forums.opensymphony.com/thread.jspa?threadID=1685&tstart=60\n&gt; \n&gt; I reproduced the proposal below so you don&#39;t have to read the entire thread.\n&gt; \n&gt; I am still thinking of implementing it at some point, along with Data\n&gt; Provider iterators, but it does require some re-design in our code base and\n&gt; the demand hasn&#39;t been too strong so far (you&#39;re not the first one to\n&gt; request it, though).\n&gt; \n&gt; --\n&gt; Cédric\n&gt; \n&gt; Okay, I think I see where you are getting at. You want continuation\n&gt; factories :-)\n&gt; \n&gt; You are correct that right now, it&#39;s a two-step process:\n&gt; \n&gt; - All the factories are invoked and create all the test instances\n&gt; - TestNG runs on all the created instances\n&gt; \n&gt; which is potentially a problem if these instances consume a lot of\n&gt; resources.\n&gt; \n&gt; Your factory iterator suggestion makes sense to me.\n&gt; \n&gt; We could have a new kind of factory that returns an iterator:\n&gt; \n&gt; @Factory\n&gt; public Iterator createTests() { ... }\n&gt; \n&gt; and TestNG would basically do the following:\n&gt; \n&gt; Iterator it = factory.createTests();\n&gt; while (it.hasNext()) {\n&gt; Object testInstance = it.next();\n&gt; invoke TestNG on this testInstance\n&gt; }\n&gt; \n&gt; Then it&#39;s up to you to make sure that your test instances are only created\n&gt; when needed.\n&gt; \n&gt; How does this sound?\n&gt; \n&gt; --\n&gt; Cédric\n&gt; http://beust.com/weblog\n&gt; \n\n",
