In the description below it would \ngive details about this Exception.\n\n2) public void testFoo(){\n      try{\n        //Some code that would throw SomeDBException\n      }\n      catch(SomeDBException e){\n        //Option I  - Nothing\n        //Option II -\n        fail(&quot;SomeDBException caught&quot;);\n      }\n\nIn this second case when SomeDBException is thrown with Option I, \nJUnit would assume that you are trying to catch this Exception and \nassuming that this is a negative test would &#39;PASS&#39; the test.\n\nIn this second case when Option II is put into effect by giving a \nspecific fail() command, JUnit makes the method to &#39;FAIL&#39;.\n\nOut of the two of the above, if you are really not interested in \ncatching the Exeption then it should be just declared to be thrown \nand not explicitly caught and then JUnit would give you the result \nthe way you want it.\n\nIf you are doing this all and still getting the mentioned \nSomeDBException then that means something needs to be investigated \nfurther.\n\nI would never modify the Production code in order to make my tests \npass or fail.\n\n- Nilesh\n\n--- In junit@y..., &quot;Di Iorio, Matthew (ISS Atlanta)&quot; &lt;mdiiorio@i...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt; Laurent&#39;s message about tearDown getting called reminded me of \nsomething\n&gt; I&#39;ve wanted to post to the list.\n&gt; \n&gt; A few weeks back I was working with some database tests and was \ngetting odd\n&gt; behavior.  It took me a little while to figure it out, but what was\n&gt; happening was a test method was throwing an exception because of \nsome\n&gt; database error.  The tearDown method attempted to cleanup after the \ntest and\n&gt; it also threw a database exception.  All I got back was the \nexception that\n&gt; occurred in tearDown, not the exception that occurred in the test \nmethod.\n&gt; \n&gt; It was a real pain because I had to modify the production code to \ncatch and\n&gt; print the exception so I could uncover the actual problem.\n&gt; \n&gt; My preferred solution would be to print both exceptions.  If I get \nan\n&gt; exception in testFoo and in tearDown, JUnit should print the \nfollowing:\n&gt; \n&gt; 1) testFoo(net.iss.FooTest) \n&gt; java.lang.Exception\n&gt; \tat ...\n&gt; Exception in tearDown:\n&gt; java.lang.Exception\n&gt; \tat ...\n&gt; \n&gt; I would be willing to put together a patch to do this.
