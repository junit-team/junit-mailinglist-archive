I was inherited to take over \ntesting a client / server application.  The test cases were all \nwritten in xml (a bunch of xml defined messages that the client would \nsend to the server) where a java application would read in each test \ncase from the xml file.  It would then send the xml message to the \nserver and the server would then process that xml messages and send \nthem back another xml message.\n\n  I would like to integrate this into Junit&#39;s framework but the \nproblem I am having is that each test case has 4 xml messages that it \nsends to the server.  I would like to use JUnits TestCase method and \nread each xml file one by one.  The problem with this is that it \nwould be one method that would be reading each xml message in from \nthe file and then verifying it.  \n   \n   After looking at JUnit&#39;s framework they treat each method as a \ntest case within a class that extends TestCase.  My question is how \nwould you design this so that I could treat each file as testcase 1 \nand each message that gets read in as testcase a, b, c, etc....  I \nwould like to be able to use Junit&#39;s swing TestRunner to run all \nthese xml file test cases then.  Any help would be greatly \nappreciated.\n\nben\n\n\n",
