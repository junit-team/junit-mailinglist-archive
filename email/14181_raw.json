(Does anyone \n&gt; have a URL \n&gt; for the actual description of the bug, not just the \n&gt; newsgroup?) but the \n&gt; fix smells pretty bad to me. Most Java code exposes far more \n&gt; methods as \n&gt; public than it should. If indeed this method should not be \n&gt; part of the \n&gt; API, then it should not be public. Documenting that it \n&gt; shouldn&#39;t be used \n&gt; is an inadequate response.\n&gt; \n&gt; Often overuse of public reflects a failure to use package protected \n&gt; methods, often because the application has been divided into packages \n&gt; and yet the subpackages need to be able to access the \n&gt; internal parts of \n&gt; the superpackages. Possibly Java 6 will fix this at a language level. \n&gt; Until this is fixed most applications and libraries should \n&gt; use a single \n&gt; package, even if that package ends up containing a rather \n&gt; large number \n&gt; of classes.\n&gt; \n&gt; Another common problem is the tendency of many programmers \n&gt; and tools to \n&gt; make methods public by default. Conservative design dictates that \n&gt; methods should start their lives with the most restrictive access \n&gt; possible. If a need is discovered to make a private method public, \n&gt; that&#39;s easy to change. The reverse operation can be impossible though.\n&gt; \n&gt; -- \n&gt; Elliotte Rusty Harold  elharo@...\n&gt; XML in a Nutshell 3rd Edition Just Published!\n&gt; http://www.cafeconleche.org/books/xian3/\n&gt; http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0596007647/cafeaulaitA/\nref=nosim\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; Yahoo!
