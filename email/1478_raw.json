This is something I have often alluded to in my own company, but\n&gt;still eludes me frequently.  For that reason I wrote a utility that\n&gt;integrates with VAJ to keep the metrics coming as far as what is tested and\n&gt;what is not.  This is not a code coverage analysis; all it does is report\non\n&gt;which classes are tested and which are not, and of the ones that are - how\n&gt;much of their public interface is tested.\n\nWould you be willing to publish such an utility. I think it might be usefull\nto the community. (At least I know _I_ wanted to write something that list\nwhich class has a TestClass written for and which don&#39;t). Your stuff looks\ncool.\n\nmathieu\n\n",
