If you don&#39;t\nhave all the tests passing, and you can&#39;t get them to pass in a\nrelatively short timeframe, then you might want to ask yourself what the\nvalue of having the failing tests is.\n\n(I&#39;ve been on a team where some of the tests stayed broken for many\nweeks. I don&#39;t know why we kept those tests; it&#39;s not as though they\nadded any confidence that the system worked properly.  At least, they\ndidn&#39;t provide me with any of that sort of confidence; they mostly\nprovided me with confidence that the tests weren&#39;t an accurate\nreflection of the state of the system.)\n\nIf all the tests pass, the only value to compare from one run to the\nnext is &quot;how many tests are there&quot; -- and that&#39;s not something that you\nreally need a stylesheet to manage.\n\nDid that answer help at all?\n \n-- \nBrett Neumeier &lt;random@...&gt;\n\n",
