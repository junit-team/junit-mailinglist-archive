    "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1841204960\">Hi all,<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On 8/16/06, Cédric Beust ♔ &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:cbeust@...\">cbeust@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;  But your reaction proves the point I was making earlier even better than I<br/>\n&gt;  could have:  where do you draw the line when you are trying to &quot;do the<br/>\n&gt;  simplest thing that could possibly work&quot;?<br/>\n<br/>\nThat is an interesting question. I think what the simplest thing that<br/>\ncould possibly work is often subjective. I think the answer depends on<br/>\nwho is implementing the solution and the &quot;tools&quot; in that persons<br/>\n&quot;mental toolbox&quot;.<br/>\nSometimes the simplest thing that could possibly work, as pointed out<br/>\nby my better half,  is interpreted as &quot;the easiest thing that could<br/>\npossibly work&quot;. They are not always the same. Years ago I often heard<br/>\nstatements like:<br/>\n&quot;Sure polymorphism is cool but swicth clauses are much easie to<br/>\nunderstand for most people&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nSo,<br/>\n<br/>\nfor some people, when developing a robot, this:<br/>\n<br/>\nexecuteCommand(Command command) {<br/>\n   switch (command.type) {<br/>\n       case Command.GETLAUNDRY :<br/>\n            getLaundry(); break;<br/>\n       case Command.DODISHES :<br/>\n            doDishes(); break;<br/>\n       case Command.CLEANHOUSE :<br/>\n            cleanHouse(); break;<br/>\n       default<br/>\n            throw new UnknownCommandException(command);<br/>\n   }<br/>\n}<br/>\n<br/>\nis easier and thus simpler than<br/>\n<br/>\nexecuteCommand(Command command) {<br/>\n     command.execute();<br/>\n}<br/>\n<br/>\nFor others alternative 2 (of course with one new class for each<br/>\ncommand) is simpler and easier.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow do you use the rule &quot;the simplest thing that could possibly work?&quot;<br/>\nI think it is hard to argue witht someone else that &quot;this is simpler<br/>\nthan that&quot; but you can keep /yourself/ from doing things in a more<br/>\ncomplicated manner than absolutely necessary.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think I abuse interfaces according to some people but I find it<br/>\nsimpler because they communicate clearly what I intend the /published/<br/>\ninterface of my code to be. To me it is simpler to be able to ignore<br/>\nimplementation specific stuff by just looking at the interfaces.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo what is &quot;simple&quot; to you? </span></blockquote></div>",
