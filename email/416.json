Over the next few weeks<br/>\nI&#39;ll be posting several of them for the benefit of anyone else who wants to<br/>\nuse them.  I would love to hear any feedback you have to give.<br/>\n<br/>\nA common problem in testing a distributed system is interacting with<br/>\nasynchronous services.  For example, suppose you want to test that an email<br/>\nmessage gets sent correctly, so you set up a local mailbox to test with.<br/>\nYou write a test case that should cause a message to be sent.  But if you<br/>\ncheck that mailbox immediately after sending, your test is bound to fail.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat everyone I&#39;ve seen does is to tell their test case to go to sleep for<br/>\nsome hardcoded length of time before checking.  But as conditions may vary<br/>\nin multiple testing environments, this interval will have to cover even the<br/>\nslowest possible case in order to avoid false negatives--and then everyone<br/>\nsuffers the delay.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I think these test developers would really like to do is use a<br/>\nRetriedAssert!  Example:<br/>\n<br/>\n     new RetriedAssert(5000, 250) { // timeout, interval<br/>\n         public void run() throws Exception {<br/>\n             doSomeStuff();<br/>\n             assert(someCondition);<br/>\n         }<br/>\n     }.start();<br/>\n<br/>\nYou&#39;re free to muck it up however you wish, and there&#39;s a few test cases to<br/>\ntell you if you mucked it up too much.  :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n &lt;&lt;RetriedAssert.java&gt;&gt;  &lt;&lt;RetriedAssertTest.java&gt;&gt; <br/>\nKevin<br/>\n<br/>\nP.S.
