With JMock, it does not work, you \n&gt; &gt; have to rely on text comple=\r\ntion features.\n&gt; &gt; With EasyMock, it works like a charm.\n&gt; \n&gt; I do admit th=\r\nat this is a shortcoming, but I don&#39;t find that annoying \n&gt; when I use jMoc=\r\nk. In fact, in an odd way, if I find I really \n&gt; want code completion when =\r\ndefining fakes or expectations, then perhaps\nmy \n&gt; interface is too complex=\r\n. :)\n\nThis raises an issue which I don&#39;t *think* I&#39;ve seen mentioned here.\n=\r\n\nI find that there&#39;s a bit of a benefit when writing test code with\nEasyMoc=\r\nk (either version) in that after typing in what I want to be\ncalled before =\r\nit exists, I can then ask Eclipse to generate all the\nmethods for me, in bo=\r\nth the interface and the class. The tests really do\ndrive the code - it&#39;s o=\r\nnly when a test requires a method to be present\nthat it gets put in the int=\r\nerface, because I don&#39;t end up writing the\ninterface declarations by hand i=\r\nn the first place. (Of course, I add\ndocumentation and might change the par=\r\nameter names later, but that&#39;s a\ndifferent matter.)\n\nJust a small benefit, =\r\nbut I thought I&#39;d mention it...\n\nJon (a very happy EasyMock user)\n\nClearswi=\r\nft monitors, controls and protects all its messaging traffic in compliance =\r\nwith its corporate email policy using Clearswift products.\nFind out more ab=\r\nout Clearswift, its solutions and services at http://www.clearswift.com\n\nTh=\r\nis communication is confidential and may contain privileged information int=\r\nended solely for the named addressee(s).
