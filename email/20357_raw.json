But it is\nless=\r\n flexible then TestSuite. In JUnit 3.8 you have an option to add\nsome metho=\r\nds from one class and some methods from the another class.\nSee also related=\r\n topic &quot;Filter improvement&quot;. I think this\nfunctionality should be available=\r\n also here, perhaps, with futher\nimprovement, such as use of patterns. \nAt =\r\nleast one should be able to run couples of methods from the given\nclass. Wh=\r\nen I have some related tests I preferred to run them\naltogether and to look=\r\n what is fails. It helps me both to save the\ntime and to identify the probl=\r\nem. I feel lack of this in JUnit 4.\n\n\n",
