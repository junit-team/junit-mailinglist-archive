(&quot;Test only the code you&#39;re responsible<br/>\nfor&quot;)<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you find yourself answering, &quot;Yeah, but I need to test my WebStart<br/>\nconfiguration...&quot;, then I&#39;d say again that configuration testing sounds<br/>\nmore like integration testing.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI wish I had a recommendation for a good automated integration testing<br/>\ntool, perhaps someone else can supply that?<br/>\n<br/>\n-Kevin<br/>\n--- Sean Machin &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:smachin@...\">smachin@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Hi All,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m trying to think of a good way to test some Java apps. that are<br/>\n&gt; launched by WebStart.  I&#39;ve setup some basic tests with HTTPUnit<br/>\n&gt; that go to the launch page, follow each WebStart link and ensure<br/>\n&gt; that a valid JNLP file is retrieved for each simulated<br/>\n&gt; link click.  What I&#39;d really like to do is to actually load<br/>\n&gt; each app, get past the login screen and verify each<br/>\n&gt; app&#39;s main frame is bought up without any database exceptions etc.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Can anyone advise on how best to accomplish this?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Thanks,<br/>\n&gt; Sean<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>__________________________________<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nProtect your identity with Yahoo!
