Jtest uses <br/>\nParasoft&#39;s patented Test Generation System technology (patent <br/>\n#5,784,553 & 5,761,408) to automatically generate input test cases <br/>\nthat expose uncaught, undocumented runtime exceptions. <br/>\n<br/>\nDuring black-box testing Jtest automatically reads DbC specification <br/>\ninformation built into a class with the DbC language, then <br/>\nautomatically creates and executes test cases that verify the <br/>\nfunctionality specified in the contract. You can add user-defined <br/>\ntest cases by adding code to automatically-generated JUnit test class <br/>\ntemplates, modifying automatically-generated JUnit test classes based <br/>\non automatically-generated Jtest test cases, pointing Jtest to your <br/>\nexisting JUnit test cases, or by adding method inputs in the Jtest <br/>\nGUI. <br/>\n<br/>\nDuring regression testing, Jtest verifies that code modifications do <br/>\nnot introduce problems. Jtest performs automatic regression testing <br/>\nat the class level, allowing you to run test suites that monitor your <br/>\ncode&#39;s integrity early in the development process. You can perform <br/>\nregression testing by restoring a test and clicking a button, or by <br/>\nintegrating batch-mode Jtest into nightly builds to ensure that <br/>\nregression errors are found and fixed as soon as possible.</div>",
