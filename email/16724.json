How do you refactor to eliminate a dependency on <br/>\nmember objects. I understand how to do it with objects a class <br/>\ncollaborates with, but it is a different matter when the member <br/>\nobjects are &quot;owned&quot; by the object being tested. I guess you could <br/>\nprovide the class with a factory class it could use to create it&#39;s <br/>\nmembers, but this seems like a lot of overhead for an object that only <br/>\nneeds this capability for testing purposes.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am a new java programmer, so forgive me if my terminology isn&#39;t <br/>\ncorrect. Hopefully you can understand what I am trying to say.</div>",
