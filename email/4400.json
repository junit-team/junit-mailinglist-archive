Like anything else in XP, you do as much as you need and no \nmore.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Of course, if someone else is pressuring you to write the tests because he \nwants coverage, you can ask him this:</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>&quot;If I didn&#39;t spend 80 hours writing these tests, I could spend my time \nwriting each test as I need it and the rest of the time writing new code. Given \nwhat I know about the code, I won&#39;t be any faster writing tests whether I write \nthem all at once or as I need them. With that in mind, what would you like me to \ndo? In the worst case, I need all the tests up front and end up writing them now \nanyway. It looks like you win.&quot;</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>How does that sound, everyone?</div>\n<div><br><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\">*********** REPLY SEPARATOR \n***********<br><br><blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On 2002-03-18 at 10:41 Alan Bram wrote:</span></blockquote></font></div>\n<blockquote\n style=\"PADDING-LEFT:5px;MARGIN-LEFT:5px;BORDER-LEFT:#000000 2px solid;\">\n  <div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\">In this discussion, apparently we have been \n  talking about &quot;retrofitting&quot; unit tests for old code that never before had \n  them. The notion seems to be that each method in a class, or perhaps each \n  public method, should have a unit test.</font></div>\n  <div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\"></font>&nbsp;</div>\n  <div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\">I think this is wrong. I think, as J.B. said, \n  that in such a case you should concentrate on testing features, not simply \n  methods.</font></div>\n  <div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\"></font>&nbsp;</div>\n  <div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\">I would say that for new code, where you&#39;re \n  writing tests along with your production code, it might make sense to try for \n  a test per (public) method. But that&#39;s because in this case you have the \n  benefit of thinking about the testing at the time you&#39;re writing the code. I \n  think you&#39;re more likely to design your code in such a way as to have this \n  make more sense. (The &quot;testing influences design&quot; notion.)</font></div>\n  <div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\"></font>&nbsp;</div>\n  <div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\">The problem I see with mindlessly (or even \n  mindfully) writing a test for each method, just to satisfy someone&#39;s idea that \n  code coverage is good, is that you&#39;re likely to (1) invest a lot of (or even a \n  little) time; and (2) generate a lot of test code (which will have to be \n  maintained, don&#39;t forget), for what will turn out to be little or no benefit. \n  I would bet that the marginal number of bugs found by &quot;complete&quot; per-method \n  tests over a more sensible per-feature approach, both now and forever in the \n  future, is very close to zero. At least that&#39;s my impression based on my own \n  experiences.</font></div>\n  <div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\"></font>&nbsp;</div>\n  <div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\">More is not always better.</font></div>\n  <div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\"></font>&nbsp;</div>\n  <div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\">I would be very curious to know if anyone can \n  report on actual (measured, quantitative) experiences that either support or \n  refute this.</font></div>\n  <div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\"></font>&nbsp;</div>\n  <div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\">&nbsp;- Alan Bram</font></div>\n  <div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\">&nbsp;&nbsp; alan@...</font><font\n size=\"2\"></font></div></blockquote></html> \n\n<br>\n\n<html><head>\n \n</head> \n \n<div><font size=\"2\">J.
