More to the point it is not economically viable\nto write and maintain the recovery code.\n\nIf an exception is caused by a\nsoftware error I just want the stacktrace to be logged. Forcing \ndevelopers to write catch clauses for checked exceptions increases \nthe possiblity they will lose that original stacktrace.\n\nHave you not been in the position of debugging a stacktrace to find\nthat it was just a rethrow of another exception which has now been\nlost?\n\nMy preference would be to use unchecked exceptions everywhere and\nmaybe use checked exceptions (refactor from unchecked to checked)\nwhere I will explicitely try to do some recovery.\n\n--\nNeil Swingler\n\n&gt; &gt;If they don&#39;t have to write any exception handling code they can&#39;t \n&gt; &gt;code errors into it. The exceptions can propogate to a single\n&gt; &gt;point to be logged.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; How do you effectively handle all exceptions when they bubble up to \na \n&gt; single common point?\n&gt; \n&gt; It seems to me the best you can do is log them and attempt to \nperform \n&gt; some generic action like exiting.  Without the original context of \nthe \n&gt; exception, it may be difficult to take any intelligent corrective \n&gt; action.  Handling an exception closer to its point of origin is \n&gt; generally easier and less detrimental to the system.\n&gt; \n&gt; That said, I&#39;d agree that if all exceptions bubble to the top then \nthe \n&gt; use of unchecked exceptions eases maintenance.  Otherwise all \nmethods \n&gt; would need to declare all exceptions potentially thrown by those \nmethods \n&gt; they call, ad infinitum.  Messy, indeed.  \n&gt; \n\n\n\n\n",
