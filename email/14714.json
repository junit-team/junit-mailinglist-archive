If you<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; implement me, you&#39;d better pass my Contract Tests, or you don&#39;t really<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; implement me. If the above example were really important, there&#39;d be <br/>\n&gt; a test.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; That&#39;s a good idea, and if I&#39;d ever seen it done in practice I might be<br/>\n&gt; more willing to accept it. In fact,. I have never once seen an interface<br/>\n&gt; based API that came with a set of tests implementations were required to<br/>\n&gt; pass. This includes major APIs shipped by organizations like JavaSoft<br/>\n&gt; and the W3C, not just internal corporate work and open source hacking.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>If I hadn&#39;t had a disk failure last year, you&#39;d be able to see an <br/>\nexample or two, but I did, so you can&#39;t.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Of course, I&#39;ve never looked at your codebase. Given that you do this, I<br/>\n&gt; suspect your code is likely more robust and reliable than what i see out<br/>\n&gt; there, which doesn&#39;t really surprise me. It&#39;s long been known that a<br/>\n&gt; small percentage of programmers are vastly more productive than most<br/>\n&gt; programmers are. I suspect the programmers who hang out on mailing<br/>\n&gt; lists, attend conferences, write and read articles, and so forth tend to<br/>\n&gt; be in the more productive group. However, these are not the majority of<br/>\n&gt; working developers, and realistic API design has to work for the<br/>\n&gt; majority of client programmers, not just the top 10%.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Agreed. I would rather work to fix the programmers. It&#39;s the idealist in <br/>\nme. What if a majority of client programmers knew to look for Contract <br/>\nTests?<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJ. B.
