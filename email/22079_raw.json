Please allow me to\nillustrate my question with a simple example.\n\nI&#39;ve got a class called Coordinate that represents a point in a 3D\ncoordinate system. I&#39;ve overloaded the toString method of this class\nto write out the X, Y, and Z values of the coordinate in a simple\nString. Now I want to test my toString method using JUnit.\n\nIf the Coordinate.toString test method fails (because the string was\nnot constructed in the correct format) I would like to provide the\nprogrammer running the test with a copy of the incorrect string, since\nit provides valuable clues about what is broken with the method under\ntest. I typically do this by placing System.err.println statements in\nmy test method. However, I realize that using System.err.println isn&#39;t\nthe most portable or elegant way to provide this information to the\nprogrammer executing the test.\n\nWhat I really want is a GUI that allows the programmer to select a\nfailed test from a list of failed tests, and then to view supplemental\ntest data I provide him/her.\n\nI was thinking I could do this by completing the following tasks:\n\n- Implementing the RunListener interface in JUnit.\n- Create an extension of Exception that could contain a HashMap of\nsimple parameters and that would be passed to the constructor of a\nFailure object from within a test.\n- Creating Failure objects in my tests that contain the supplemental\nfailrure data.\n- Passing these failure objects to my RunListener implementaiton.\n- Creating a FailureProcessor class that displays a GUI with the\ninformation in my RunListener implemenation to show the programmer\nexecuting my tests the supplemental failure data as described above.\n(FailureProcessor would be an interface so that you could do different\nthings with the supplemental failure data, not just show it in a GUI.)\n\nBefore I begin this work, I wanted to ask if there was a better way to\ndo this. I know I could use a logging framework from within my test\nmethod, but I really want to work within the JUnut framework, not\noutside of it. I also want a nice little GUI, not a log file.\n\nHow are other programmers handling instances when they want to display\nsupplemental data on failed tests? Does my approach sound reasonable?\n\nThe Sunburned Surveyor\n\n",
