I find they<br/>\nrarely run the tests that are there, often check in<br/>\ncode that breaks the tests (but not the build), and<br/>\nthey very frequently add new code that&#39;s untested.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not sure what to do.  I value the tests, and am<br/>\ntrying to do test-first development, but I&#39;m playing<br/>\ncatch-up with testing the other developer&#39;s code, or<br/>\nmore likely letting the coverage suffer.  We use EMMA<br/>\nfor code coverage, but I think I&#39;m the only one who<br/>\nlooks at the reports.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome parts of the code are not easy to test, and I<br/>\nsympathize with my coworkers on that account.  I just<br/>\ngot started with easymock to get better coverage for<br/>\nthe hard-to-test bits, but I&#39;m afraid I&#39;ll alienate my<br/>\nnon-test-infected coworkers even more by using it.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, I don&#39;t have any answers really, but to answer<br/>\nthe OP&#39;s question I am &quot;really using JUnit during<br/>\ndevelopment&quot;, but there are certain pains involved. <br/>\nOn the whole I still think it&#39;s worth the effort, but<br/>\nI do wish the effort required was less.<br/>\n<br/>\n--- &quot;James P.

We strive for the<br/>\n&gt; goal that nothing <br/>\n&gt; ships without complete automated tests. As a Java<br/>\n&gt; shop, we use JUnit.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; However, we do not use testing as a design tool. We<br/>\n&gt; use a spiral model <br/>\n&gt; built around testing and design and coding. Some<br/>\n&gt; code is written test <br/>\n&gt; first, some code is tested after it is written. All<br/>\n&gt; code is designed <br/>\n&gt; into the software structure before it is committed<br/>\n&gt; to source code. As <br/>\n&gt; long as the code is tested before it ships, we are<br/>\n&gt; confident that it <br/>\n&gt; works.
