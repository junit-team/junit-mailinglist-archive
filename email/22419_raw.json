It&#39;s onl=\r\ny about 4-5 pages of code to read it all if you&#39;re security concerned. The =\r\ntest failure basically tells me you have the slowest computer to ever run t=\r\nhese tests ;)\n\nOr, as the javadocs from the test-class say:\n\n/**\n * These t=\r\nests assert that the expected peformance of classes/methods/both.\n *\n * Whi=\r\nle the occasional glitch in computing power can make these tests fail (if a=\r\nctual time exceeds expected + 33%),\n * the lower bound should *never* be vi=\r\nolated.\n *\n * These tests usually fail if run in a debugger, due to the cha=\r\nnged timings.\n * \n */\n\n\n\n&gt; Also, Just out of curiosity, what happens thread=\r\n count wise when you aren&#39;t using ConfigurableParallelComputer, does it lit=\r\nerally fire up a thread per test?\nYes, in &quot;methods&quot; mode it&#39;s one thread pe=\r\nr test method. Classes mode is one per class. Both is, well, both. In my 10=\r\n+ years as test-infected, I have really never ever had a use-case where thi=\r\ns kind of solution would be appropriate (maybe some kind of really slow dat=\r\nabase with unlimited cheap connections). With thousands of test classes you=\r\n come to a grinding halt with any of these options.\n\n  \n&gt;1 more thing, do a=\r\nny of the selenium projects you speak of use the &gt;selenium grid with window=\r\ns? We are having a hell of a time getting &gt;that working too. We have the hu=\r\nb on Ubuntu and windows slaves don&#39;t &gt;play nice but Ubuntu slaves work fine=\r\n. I haven&#39;t found much info on &gt;the issues we are seeing nor have a I gotte=\r\nn any responses on the &gt;Selenium mailing list. We may just have to skip IE =\r\ntesting for now &gt;and running everything on firefox Ubuntu.\n\nWe run all our =\r\nbrowser-bots on windows, and the CI is bamboo on linux. We do not use grid.=\r\n Instead we let a single build run with 4 threads towards a single instance=\r\n of selenium RC (with firefox). This has proved to be a nice, stable setup =\r\nthat gives us a lot of punch.\nNow we also partition the entire build into 2=\r\n, so we have two separate (Windows) pizza boxes running RC+ firefox, for a =\r\ngrand total\nof 8 available browsers. This allows us to use firefox as the b=\r\nackbone in our selenium-TDD-based development that has allowed us\nvirtually=\r\n regression free frequent deployments.\n\nWe run Internet Explorer and Opera =\r\non separate boxes. Opera Selenium tests are hard to make stable, but they a=\r\nlso work concurrently.\nInternet Exploder is a strict one-instance per box f=\r\nor any kind of\nstability. I know some people use virtualization. We just ad=\r\nd boxes.\n\nThe other projects do much the same, but they all pre-date grid s=\r\nomewhat.\n\nWe&#39;re also planning to try out Chrome once we upgrade to Selenium=\r\n 2.0, we really need something webkit based.\n\nKristian\n\n\n\n\n",
