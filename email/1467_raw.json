In other words, the\nTimedTest will not wait for the decorated test to run to completion if\nthe maximum elapsed time is exceeded.\n\n- The TimedTest.outOfTime() method was added to unambiguously determine\nwhether the test failed due to the maximum elapsed time being exceeded\nor the test itself failing.\n\n- The LoadTest class now supports enforcing test atomicity using the\nsetEnforceTestAtomicity() method.  By default, test atomicity is not\nenforced for test cases that spawn threads, either directly or\nindirectly.\n\n- The TimedTest.toString() method now includes an indication of whether\nthe timed test will wait for test completion (WAITING) or wait for the\nmaximum elapsed time to expire (NON-WAITING).\n\n- The LoadTest.toString() method now includes an indication of whether\nthe load test will enforce test atomicity by waiting for control to\nreturn (ATOMIC) or waiting for all load test threads to complete\n(NON-ATOMIC).\n\n- Added the &quot;Writing Effective JUnitPerf Tests&quot; section to the\ndocumentation to clarify the different types of timed tests and load tests.\n\nTests written with JUnitPerf 1.3 will not be affected by these changes.\n\nThe JUnitPerf documentation is available at\n\n       http://www.clarkware.com/software/JUnitPerf.html\n\nJUnitPerf 1.4 can be downloaded directly from\n\n       http://www.clarkware.com/software/junitperf1.4.zip\n\nThanks to everyone who has contributed to this release of JUnitPerf.\nSpecial thanks to Ervin Varga for suggesting the new timed and load test \nstrategies and his continual role as a reviewer.\n\nAny feedback you may have is most welcome and appreciated!\n\nThanks and enjoy!\n\nMike\n\n-- \nMike Clark\nClarkware Consulting, Inc.\nCustom Software Architecture, Design,\nDevelopment, and Performance Consulting\nhttp://www.clarkware.com\n\n\n",
