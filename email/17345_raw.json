As I understand it, \nyour problem is:\n\n1) MockRunner has a concrete subclass of TestCase without any test methods\n2) Eclipse tries to run this class, which fails, because it has no test \nmethods.\n\nAre all your real test classes in one package?  If so, you can configure \ncontinuous testing to run only that package, and not the whole project.  \nWould that be helpful?\n\n    David Saff\n\nPaul Andrews wrote:\n&gt; I have the exact same problem - i.e. trying to use MockRunner in\n&gt; Eclipse. This is compounded by the fact that I am using the continuous\n&gt; test plugin which executes these tests automatically using the\n&gt; built-in Eclipse junit mechanism and keeps telling me that my tests\n&gt; have failed. So it isn&#39;t an option for me to run the tests some other way.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt; Yahoo! Groups Links\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;   \n\n\n",
