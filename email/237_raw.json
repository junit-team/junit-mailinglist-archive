But, often times even when I&#39;m testing a \n&gt; public method there are other methods I need to call just to see \n&gt; whether the one I&#39;m testing did what it was supposed to do.  And \n&gt; sometimes these &quot;testability methods&quot; are ones I would never want \n&gt; production code to invoke and mess up my encapsulation.  So you \n&gt; can&#39;t make em private, and you can&#39;t make em not private!  Hence \n&gt; the need for some trick like the ones that were\n&gt; suggested.\n\nWhen I&#39;m testing things that require me to call private/protected \nmethods I find it easiest to use reflection to open up a class so I \ncan call some method or check some contents of an instance.  I built \na simple class called UnitTestAccessor which uses reflection to break \nopen instances allowing me to call any method I wish or check any \ndata I need.\n\nGreat example of using this was to test a Runnable that spun in a \nloop calling some protected methods to perform analysis.  Since it \nwas hard to test across threads I used the UnitTestAccessor to \nsimulate thread calls into these protected methods.  I&#39;ll post this \nclass tomorrow as I don&#39;t have the code at my disposal right now. 8)\n\n--charlie\n\n\n",
