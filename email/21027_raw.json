I feel pretty confident about\ntheir difference. I guess the problem i had and perhaps other is that\nwhereas a theory is in fact a universal quantification (\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_quantification). The problem is,\nwhile the set for each possible value is often indefinite, you have to be\nrealistic and provide appropriate candidate data (using data parameter\nsupplies). And that&#39;s when theories start to look a lot like parameterized\ntests, while in fact they are in nature very different .\n\nRaphael\n\n\n\n\nOn Thu, Oct 23, 2008 at 1:42 PM, Joakim Ohlrogge\n&lt;joakim.ohlrogge@...&gt;wrote:\n\n&gt;   &gt; Thanks for the clear responses. What i see is that a theory is a\n&gt; &gt; (parametrized) test inside out; you don&#39;t specify what will work but you\n&gt; &gt; leave out what should not be tested (iow assumptions by leaving out the\n&gt; data\n&gt; &gt; for these cases).\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;m not sure that there is a misunderstanding here but just to make sure:\n&gt;\n&gt; While what you wrote is technically true I think it simplifies the\n&gt; theory a bit. I would consider a long list of assumptions in a theory\n&gt; a smell, perhaps named: &quot;assmumptions is the mother of all screw ups&quot;\n&gt; :). I almost fell into the trap of using assumptions to filter the\n&gt; &quot;desired&quot; datapoints to the &quot;correct&quot; theory but that would be a\n&gt; violation of the idea, the idea is that the datapoints I have\n&gt; specified and all other datapoints I (or an automatic tool) can come\n&gt; up with should pass. I think that there is a subtle difference here\n&gt; between data driven tests and theories, data driven tests are merely a\n&gt; convenient way to create lots of specific examples while theories aim\n&gt; at the abstraction, the definition of the truth in this system.\n&gt;\n&gt; If a lot of assumptions are a smell, then what are our weapons against\n&gt; them? I found that declaring types help here and it pays off\n&gt; instantly. For instance, if I represent name as a String and phone\n&gt; number as a String and it is important to my theories to differentiate\n&gt; between the two I could ether:\n&gt;\n&gt; Assume that any string with numbers in it is a phone number and that\n&gt; anything that is not a phone number is a name.\n&gt; Or, I could declare the type Name and the type PhoneNumber.\n&gt;\n&gt; In this case I would prefer a type.\n&gt;\n&gt; If I was intersted in defining what a long distance call is I could\n&gt; write that as a theory:\n&gt;\n&gt; @Theory\n&gt; public void makeLongDistanceCall(PhoneNumber from, PhoneNumber to) {\n&gt; assumeThat(from.areaCode, is(not(equalTo(to.areaCode)));\n&gt; Call call = new Call(from, to);\n&gt; assertTrue(call.isLongDistance());\n&gt; }\n&gt;\n&gt; I probably screwed up both the domain and the design but I hope my\n&gt; idea of what an assumptions role in a theory is and how theories are\n&gt; different than data-driven tests in spite of them both being driven by\n&gt; data.\n&gt; I also hope that in the case the domain is screwed up it should be\n&gt; perfectly clear from the above theory to anyone who knows the domain.\n&gt; Finally, I hope this helps someone :)\n&gt; /J\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\n\n\n-- \nRaphael Parree\nCTO\nSOA Evangelist\n\nTrivera Technologies Global J2EE Education, Mentoring, Courseware &\nConsulting Services\nphone:+31 152600 448\nphone +33 683 468663\nDisclaimer...\n&quot;The information contained in this message may be confidential and is\nintended to be exclusively for the addressee.
