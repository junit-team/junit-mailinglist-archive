The set of objects is the fixture.  The\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; fixture is what you set up.  This is clear and unambiguous English\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; from the authors of JUnit.\n&gt; \n&gt;  &gt; &gt; For that matter, if I google I get\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; Of what relavance is this?\n&gt; \n&gt; JB cited what appeared to be a quotation backing his interpretation of\n&gt; the term.  He appeared to be claiming that it came from the JUnit Web\n&gt; site.  I was investigating the claim.\n\n!?\n\nIf you mean &quot;Ah.. but in proper usage each fixture is a different \nTestCase class...&quot;, then I was merely correcting Dave&#39;s words. At no \ntime did I cite the JUnit web site. I did, however, cite the JUnit FAQ, \nwhich incidentally the JUnit web site blesses as official by linking to \nit and calling it &quot;The JUnit FAQ&quot;. That was a different question, \nthough: which I believe was &quot;How do I run two test suites together?&quot; The \nOriginal Questioner wrote &quot;fixture&quot; for &quot;test suite&quot; and that is how \nthis all started.\n\nNow see, had you just asked me to clarify... but no, you ran with your \nassumptions and it led you entirely off course. Just ask! Just say, &quot;JB, \nI didn&#39;t see that on the JUnit web site...&quot; and then I can write &quot;That&#39;s \nnot what I meant...&quot; and this could have been civil.\n-- \nJ. B.
