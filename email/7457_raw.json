Could it be the case?  I tested the server and 2 clients locally (I \nhave no access to a network system) and it *seemed* (I don&#39;t know for sure \nthough) to work fine.  Am I missing something?\n\n&gt;However if the tcp connection is not closed properly (client disconnected \nfrom net,\n&gt;client OS crashed, ...) the server ist not informed by the tcp layer about\n&gt;it. For such cases you will have to add functionality to your server to \n&gt;actively detect them by a call to a client&#39;s method.\n\nI don&#39;t know how to implement this.  Right now, all the server&#39;s methods are \ndeclared in the remote interface, and the client gets a remote object of the \nremote interface&#39;s type to call its method.  If the server calls the client&#39;s \nmethod, would it be in another remote interface?  And what does the method \ndo, or just an empty method and may be some kind of Exception will be \ngenerated when called on?  \n\nAppreicate your further explaination, thank you again.\n\nSam\n\n\n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\n",
