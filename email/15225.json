The size and low vote count put it lower down on <br/>\nmy priority list than (especially) full native JUnit 4 support.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;    I&#39;ve also filled number of others requests against Eclipse JUnit<br/>\n&gt; integration. Please take a look. If others from this list are also<br/>\n&gt; using Eclipse and like to see some of them implemented it would make<br/>\n&gt; sense to vote for them:<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It certainly would.  Votes and discussion on Eclipse bugs are taken <br/>\nseriously by the Eclipse developers.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;&gt;   It seems violating the concept of annotations. You should not<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;annotate the behaviour, but rather define enough metadata that can be<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;used by the tool to decide how to behave.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Tricky, maybe, but violating is a strong word.  :)  Can you give an<br/>\n&gt; &gt; example of how using annotations to identify the Runner that should be<br/>\n&gt; &gt; used by a particular class might be a problem?  Thanks,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;    Let me ask you another question first. Why would you need to have a<br/>\n&gt; different runner for some specific test?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You may of course ask another question first, but I hope that I can <br/>\nstill get an answer to my question.  :)  One thing that I may have <br/>\nmanaged to make unclear is that the meaning of Runner has changed in <br/>\nJUnit 4.  Now there is a JUnitCore class responsible for running an <br/>\nentire set of test classes.  Each test class has a separate Runner <br/>\ninstance invoked, which knows how to run the tests in that class.  There <br/>\nare four runners that are currently shipping with JUnit 4:<br/>\n<br/>\n* TestClassRunner, for default JUnit 4 test classes<br/>\n* OldTestClassRunner, for implementers of the JUnit 3 <br/>\njunit.framework.Test interface<br/>\n* AllTests, for classes that do not implement Test, but declare a <br/>\nsuite() method<br/>\n* Parameterized, for the proposed new JUnit 4 parameterized test API<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;    This doesn&#39;t sound right to me to begin with and may also make more<br/>\n&gt; difficult to integrate with different tools (including coverage<br/>\n&gt; metrisc, etc).<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>There might be problems.  I&#39;ve tried it out and liked it, and I can&#39;t <br/>\nnecessarily see how coverage metrics would be affected by the new Runner <br/>\nidea.  But I&#39;d definitely be interested in your experiences with it.  <br/>\nHave you tried it?<br/>\n<br/>\n    David Saff</div>",
