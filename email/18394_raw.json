[:)]\n&gt;\n&gt; Second one: If you use XML just as a example and the real &quot;Graph\n&gt; &lt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory&gt; &quot; objects is of other king,\n&gt; than I think in parsers - well, let me explain:\n&gt; You have a &quot;Graph&quot; of objects, this mean that you have one object\n&gt; connected in other and this object connected in other and so on.\n&gt; Probably you need access some object in this &quot;Graph&quot;; when is needed\n&gt; access this object you will have chance to test it . A example is more\n&gt; explanatory:\n&gt;\n&gt; Suppose I will access a budget object; a real budget will have a lot of\n&gt; objects connected to it, this is a &quot;Graph&quot;. Make a test to know if the\n&gt; root object is correct, check yours attributes and no more. Right now I\n&gt; don&#39;t care about others objects in this &quot;Graph&quot;.\n&gt;\n&gt; Suppose now that I need access some product inside of the list product.\n&gt; This will use the first code - a kind of service; I know that I have the\n&gt; correct budget, now I need know if this budget have the correct first\n&gt; product - now I need access it. I will make a test to know if this\n&gt; product is correct.\n&gt;\n&gt; In this explanation I make unitary test step-by-step, walking on the\n&gt; &quot;Graph&quot; when needed.\n&gt;\n&gt; I expected that you have understood what I want tell. My paper will be\n&gt; more clear.
