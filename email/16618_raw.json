Do\n&gt; I have to recurse through the inner fields, comparing them with the\n&gt; overloaded method appropriate for floats?\n&gt; \n&gt;   Or am I wrong thinking the assertion doesn&#39;t work because of the\n&gt; float composition and it&#39;s probably the fault of my objects, which are\n&gt; not de facto equal?\n\nTo compare objects that wrap floats, have the object&#39;s equals() method \nhandle the tolerance, if non-zero differences are tolerable.\n\nTo compare collections that contain floats (pre-JDK 5.0), you have to \nconvert to Float or Double objects, for which equals() is implemented \nnot to allow non-zero differences, so you might be stuck there. I \nimagine the same would happen with autoboxing in JDK 5.0+.\n\nIt&#39;s silly, but do you /have/ to use floating-point numbers? I have to \nadmit, I haven&#39;t used one in years, because floating-point arithmetic \nirks me.\n-- \nJ. B.
