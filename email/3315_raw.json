This can be very complex task for testing \nonly one method, I don&#39;t want make this work.\nor\nb) create some fake classes with expected behaviour and offers its to \ntested class. But with linsk from tested class to instances to many \ndiferent classes (with many methods), creating this fake classes can \nbe very complex too.\n\nIs there some other way or have you some experiences with testing \nclasses with links to many instances of other classes? Any clue? :)\n\nSecond question:\nIf I have complex system and must test it (simulate real load, \nstress ...), which is the best way to do this, especialy how I \nrecognize expected status of system after tests and compare it to \nresult? \n\nThanx\n\nZdenek Smid\n\n\n",
