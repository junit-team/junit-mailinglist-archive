I&#39;m actually using Alex Ruiz&#39;s FEST for our t=\r\nesting and it works quite well on Windows.  With or without FEST on the Mac=\r\n, I can&#39;t seem to get any UI tests to run.  The initial frame/window comes =\r\nup in some cases but I can&#39;t do much more than that.  When running JUnit te=\r\nsts (again with or without FEST), I don&#39;t even see the frame.\n\nI&#39;ve gone th=\r\nrough what docs there are for FEST and have read the blog/article but I can=\r\n&#39;t figure it out.\n\n\n--- In junit@yahoogroups.com, Joakim Ohlrogge &lt;joakim.o=\r\nhlrogge@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Are you using swing or SWT?\n&gt; \n&gt; A stab in the dark=\r\n:\n&gt; \n&gt; Many GUI libraries such as SWT have mechanisms to protect from multi=\r\nple\n&gt; thread access. When you start a GUI from JUnit I would assume you spa=\r\nwn the\n&gt; GUI in a separate thread (knowingly or not) and if you want to ins=\r\npect\n&gt; elements in the GUI you may have to find a way to do that from the G=\r\nUI\n&gt; thread. This generally means submitting an event to the GUI&#39;s event qu=\r\neue.\n&gt; Various GUI-testing frameworks such as abbot and help you with this.=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; It was a long time since I tried any UI testing myself so pardon the =\r\nvauge\n&gt; information.
