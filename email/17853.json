Write your plug-in tests in a second plug-in project to the <br/>\none under test, export the packages from the first to make them visible <br/>\nand run the tests as JUnit plug-in tests to let PDE launch an Eclipse <br/>\nruntime for you in which the tests will be run. Warning, this is slow!<br/>\n<br/>\nChapter 12 of Erich Gamma and Kent Beck&#39;s &quot;Contributing to Eclipse: <br/>\nPrinciples, Patterns and Plug-ins&quot; gives good advice that may be useful.<br/>\nThat chapter is available as a pdf download: <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://today.java.net/today/2004/02/02/ch12Eclipse.pdf#search=%22test%20driven%20plugin%20development%20pdf%22\">http://today.java.net/today/2004/02/02/ch12Eclipse.pdf#search=%22test%20driven%20plugin%20development%20pdf%22</a><br/>\n<br/>\nIt is also worth getting hold of a copy of the book because, even if the <br/>\ncode examples are a little out of date (written for Eclipse 2.1.1), the <br/>\npatterns and principles still apply.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe second edition of &quot;Eclipse Building Commercial-Quality Plug-ins&quot; by <br/>\nEric Clayberg and Dan Rubel is also helpful (and covers Eclipse <br/>\n3.1/3.2). The authors develop a plug-in over the course of the book and <br/>\nwhile they don&#39;t practice TDD, they do show how they develop unit-tests <br/>\nfor some of the functionality.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, look at David Saff and Michael Ernst&#39;s paper &quot;Mock Object Creation <br/>\nfor Test Factoring&quot; in which they raise the idea of mocking the Eclipse <br/>\nplatform in order to remove the time it takes to launch the Eclipse <br/>\nruntime when testing plug-ins.<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://pag.csail.mit.edu/pubs/mock-factoring-paste2004-abstract.html\">http://pag.csail.mit.edu/pubs/mock-factoring-paste2004-abstract.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\nUnit-testing plug-ins is hard work. As mentioned launching the tests in <br/>\na runtime workspace via PDE adds a significant overhead to execution <br/>\ntime which makes it frustratingly slow. Moreover, setting up the test <br/>\nfixture takes a lot of time and demands a deeper knowledge of how <br/>\nEclipse manages its components than you would expect to need at first, <br/>\nfar more than you need to develop simple plug-ins without tests. (Note, <br/>\nthis in no doubt true of writing unit-tests while working with any <br/>\nplatform: I&#39;m very much a beginner in this field and have nothing with <br/>\nwhich to compare the experience.)<br/>\n<br/>\nHope this helps<br/>\n<br/>\nTim<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nisaachanstar wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; hi, all<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Could anyone make some suggestions of how to unit test Eclipse Plugin,<br/>\n&gt; especially RCP application?
