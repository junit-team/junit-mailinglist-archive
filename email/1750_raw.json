This is the difference, and it&#39;s a big one.\n\nHave we forgotten why we&#39;re testing? Think about why you are testing what\nyou are testing. You perform unit testing because you want to guarantee\nthat a class does what it claims to do. What does the class claim to do? It\nclaims to provide services through public methods. Therefore, to guarantee\nthat a class does what it claims to do, you must guarantee that the public\nmethods implement the appropriate behavior. The details of how that\nbehavior is provided is uninteresting to say the least. So why test private\nmethods? Again, I say that if they&#39;re so complex that they bear to be\ntested, then you have a class buried inside another class, which is a code\nsmell. Yank the buried class out, make its interface public and test to\nyour heart&#39;s content.\n\nBy the way, the people who test your user interface test only the behavior\nof the user interface. I&#39;m sure you know why that is.\n\nJ. B.

[mailto:rainsber@...]\nSent: 28. juni 2001 17:52\nTo: junit@yahoogroups.com\nSubject: Re: [junit] Testing Private Methods\n\n\nYes. Don&#39;t test protected and package-protected methods.\n\nA quote from the XP discussion group.\n(http://208.48.218.9/group/extremeprogramming/message/13213)\n\n&quot;I actually do think that it is cut and dried. Public members have a\nbehavior that is expected of them by their clients. Tests can be used to\ndefine that behavior and demonstrate that a particular method exhibits it.\nPrivate methods are, by definition, implementation details. Their behavior\ncan vary freely so long as the public methods don&#39;t break. Put another way:\nif every public method has been proven to behave correctly then the class\nhas been proven to be bug free. Therefore, there is never a need to test\nthe private members of a class.&quot;\n\nSo can you avoid testing them? If so, then don&#39;t; if not, then you can&#39;t\nhave it both ways: either the tests are in the class (to test private\nmethods),\nin the package (to test protected/package methods) or you can&#39;t test those\nmethods. There&#39;s no magic here...\n\nGood luck,\n\nJ. B.

It seems like its\nnot going to be possible to do it while separating the TestCase classes and\nthe business object classes.\n\nOne of the reasons I see a difficulty is that we are using VisualAge for\nJava and it would make it a deployment nightmare to include the code in the\nsame packages or, worse yet, the same classes.  I know that there are\noptions I could use outside of VA such as ANT to only build certain\nclasses,\nbut I doubt I could get the client to buy into that and I still don&#39;t think\nthat solves the private method issue.\n\nAm I just missing something easy or what?\n\nThanks,\nMike\n\n\nTo unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\njunit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n\n\nYour use of Yahoo!
