Each Runner must report a Plan, a hierarchical tree of the\n&gt; &gt; names of the tests it will run.  Test events are reported with respect\n&gt; &gt; to leaves in this tree.\n&gt; &gt; - Request.  A Request is a specification of the desired tests to be\n&gt; &gt; run.  Extensions may also define custom subclasses of Request, in order\n&gt; &gt; to, for example, read tests to be run out of an XML file--if you think\n&gt; &gt; that&#39;s a good idea. :-)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; There is an important distinction between Requests and Plans.  A \n&gt; Request\n&gt; &gt; might be &quot;Please run all tests in class ValidationTest&quot;, with the\n&gt; &gt; corresponding Plan being &quot;I will run methods foo, bar, baz, and foobar\n&gt; &gt; in class ValidationTest&quot;.\n&gt;\n&gt; How does this affect test ordering? In particular does it enable clients\n&gt; to specify and predict the order in which tests will run? If so, this\n&gt; feels dangerous since it will enable programmers to write order\n&gt; dependent unit tests, which they should really be discouraged from doing.\n\nExtenders can write Runners that might choose to run tests in a \nparticular order.  This can be useful for many reasons--for example, \nrunning fast tests first, or those most likely to fail, so that \ndevelopers can work quickly on failing tests.  The same capability \nexisted in JUnit &lt; 4.0: just google OrderedTestSuite.  As you point out, \nhowever, if a certain order is required in order to make a passing test \nfail, however, this is a good time to reconsider your testing strategy.\n\nThe built-in Runners have no notion of test ordering, so the basic \nbehavior of undefined test ordering will remain.\n\n    David Saff\n\n",
