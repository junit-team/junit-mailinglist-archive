Right now means development/debugging but of course that <br/>\nmeans testing too. [Aside, in smalltalk, for many years, I have been <br/>\nwriting small test cases right inside the method body as a <br/>\ncomment &#39;during&#39; writing of the method. This took the place of <br/>\nwriting workspace tests. I could unit test the method I just wrote, <br/>\nand six months later it serves as a handy mini-doc on how that code <br/>\nworks. This made a lot of sense in st where you can swipe and <br/>\nevaluate the code right in the method pane but that doesnt work in <br/>\nJava IDEs so it doesnt translate as well].<br/>\n<br/>\nMy persistence objects are currently quite unstable. So an <br/>\ninteresting automated test is whether the code completes without <br/>\nthrowing an exception. So, my unit tests DO assert something - that <br/>\nthe code doesnt crash.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs things stabilise that will become a boring test (only for <br/>\nregression test a framework change). But at this point, those test <br/>\nmethods would serve double-duty for my purposes if they could return <br/>\na value.<br/>\n<br/>\nEventually I will add junit tests which will assert the findings that <br/>\nare now just explorations and new code. (I&#39;m aware that that might <br/>\nappear backwards to a test-first proponent, that&#39;s a whole nother <br/>\ndebate. I am agnostic on whether I write the test before or &#39;during&#39;. <br/>\nI think i am a &#39;test-during&#39; proponent). <br/>\n<br/>\nBut meanwhile, I am journalling (cataloging etc, this seems to be a <br/>\nsticking point) all my testing &#39;thoughts&#39;. I expect to cull the test <br/>\nsuite to a strong usable set as time goes on. So, one might say I am <br/>\ndeveloping/debugging the test suite concurrent with app <br/>\ndevelopment/testing.</div>",
