I have more than 2 years of\nexperience with JUnit and I can tell you that there&#39;s a _huge_\ndifference between the tests I wrote when I began and the ones I write\nnow.\n\n&gt; I read a lot about the problems of JUnit/TDD.\n\nlinks please.  I&#39;m interested to read more about those problems.\n\n&gt; Maybe I change my opinion. But I am not so blind to overlook all the \n&gt; problems concerning JUnit/TDD.\n\nI don&#39;t say (and I think nobody says) that JUnit is perfect (why do\nyou think I&#39;m managing JUnit-addons?) but it gives you enough freedom\nto write and test pretty much whatever you want.  But of course you\nhave to invest some time understanding the framework.\n\nSince I haven&#39;t used JTest (well, $3500...) I can&#39;t really say if\nJTest would be more useful *for me* than JUnit + my addons.  But I\nwill first learn DbC before learning a new test runner (JTest).\n\n-Vladimir\n\n\n",
