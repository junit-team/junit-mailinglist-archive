This\n&gt; is true even if the parameters are strings.  There is no way to find\n&gt; out what the strings are/were.\n&gt;\n&gt; It would be better if the runner could add metadata (like parameters)\n&gt; to the Description; the metadata could then be handled/interpreted by\n&gt; RunListener reporters.\n&gt;\n&gt; -Dan\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
