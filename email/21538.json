Is JUnit a unit testing tool? or is it a testing management tool in which we store test cases and test execution results<br/>\n2. I have download Junit from the <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.junit.org/,\">http://www.junit.org/,</a> however I have not been able to &quot;load&quot; the tool. I am not sure on which file to execute? I am running on Windows XP SP2. <br/>\n<br/>\nI understand that these might be newbie questions, however any pointers you might provide me would be very appericated</div>",
