I want to be able\n&gt; to display a message for all the URLs that f=\r\nail. But I cannot see how\n&gt; to do that.\n&gt; \n&gt; This test only does on thing, =\r\nso I don&#39;t think this is a case where I\n&gt; need to break up the test. Also I=\r\n don&#39;t want to have to be aware of\n&gt; what URLs fail before hand by checking=\r\n specific URLs with assertEquals.\n&gt; \n&gt; Is there a way I can display multipl=\r\ne errors or failures, in Junit?\n&gt; I have read the FAQ about the logic for n=\r\not being able to display\n&gt; multiple results, but I don&#39;t feel like the argu=\r\nment is applicable here.\n&gt; \n&gt; If there is a previous response, please fowar=\r\ned the message id, when\n&gt; searched I kept getting &#39;search timed out, only p=\r\nartial results&#39;.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks, Karen\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; _____________=\r\n___________________\n&gt; \n&gt; YAHOO!
