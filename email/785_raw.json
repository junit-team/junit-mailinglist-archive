I&#39;m growing a\n&gt;framework for testing JSPs by just calling them locally.  But, how do\n&gt;you get the JSP-compiled code to use the right (mock) class?  The only\n&gt;way I can see, is to completely avoid the &lt;usebean&gt; functionality, and\n&gt;roll your own equivalent code which is &quot;mock-aware&quot;.\n&gt;\n\nWhy not just have your test code put the right mock object in the session \n(or request) objects? Usebean is no magic, is just does a getAttribute. I \nguess you are talking about beans that get instantiated (with parameters) by \nthe JSP itself, in which case a trick would be to have your mock have the \nsame classname (hello confusion!) and be put before the real objects in your \nclasspath during unit testing.\n\nmathieu\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n",
