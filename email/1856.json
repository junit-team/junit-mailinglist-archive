My personal opinion is that it is a <br/>\nmatter of choosing the right tool for the task at hand, sometimes mock <br/>\nobjects will be better, other times Cactus should get the nod (particularly <br/>\nfor testing against multiple app servers in a running environment - which <br/>\nis more functional testing than unit testing anyway).<br/>\n<br/>\nRobert</div>",
