Test First means that very few of my methods are<br/>\nprivate, and I really don&#39;t see this as a bad thing.  (Most of the ones that<br/>\nare private are there only because that&#39;s what Eclipses&#39; Extract Method<br/>\nrefactoring does).<br/>\n<br/>\nNB:  That is not the same as making private methods public for testing<br/>\npurposes.  That should be avoided at all <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Chirag Shashikant Doshi [mailto:chirag.doshi@...] <br/>\n&gt; Sent: 16 October 2003 04:02<br/>\n&gt; To: junit@yahoogroups.com<br/>\n&gt; Subject: RE: [junit] Re: How to test private methods, its urgent<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Hi Michael<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Personally, I don&#39;t believe in private methods.

Therefore well <br/>\n&gt; tested public <br/>\n&gt; &gt; methods will include the behaviour of the private methods.  <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; There is no real reason for directly testing private methods.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Domain objects support the GUI. By the logic above a well <br/>\n&gt; tested GUI will include the behavior of the domain objects, <br/>\n&gt; so there is no reason to unit test the domain objects :-)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve occasionally found reason to write unit tests for <br/>\n&gt; private, supporting methods. Often you loose efficiency <br/>\n&gt; testing supporting methods indirectly via their caller - such <br/>\n&gt; as in the case where you want to test their ability to <br/>\n&gt; properly handle a range of input values. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Personally, I don&#39;t believe in private methods. I&#39;d rather <br/>\n&gt; make everything public and testable and expose real APIs via <br/>\n&gt; Java Interfaces.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; To answer the original poster: google junit + &quot;private methods&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ---<br/>\n&gt; Outgoing mail is certified Virus Free.<br/>\n&gt; Checked by AVG anti-virus system (http://www.grisoft.com).<br/>\n&gt; Version: 6.0.522 / Virus Database: 320 - Release Date: 9/29/2003<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to: <br/>\n&gt; junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
