They point out=\r\n that TestCase, like key\nabstractions in many mature frameworks, has a high=\r\n pattern density,\nmaking it easy to use but hard to change. In this install=\r\nment of the\nAOP@Work series, Wes Isberg revisits the Cook&#39;s Tour and shows =\r\nyou how\nusing AOP pointcuts rather than object-oriented designs can help yo=\r\nu\navoid some of the pattern density that makes mature designs hard to\nchang=\r\ne.\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\nThe author further goes on to state that:\n\nIn this article, I wa=\r\nlk through the design presented by Erich Gamma\nand Kent                    =\r\n                                         \n    Beck in &quot;JUnit: A Cook&#39;s Tour=\r\n&quot; (see the Resources section). For\neach Java       pattern they present, I =\r\npropose an AspectJ alternative\nand evaluate how it satisfies some of these =\r\ncanonical design goals:\t\t\t\t\t\n\nhttp://www-128.ibm.com/developerworks/java/li=\r\nbrary/j-aopwork7/index.html\n\n\nCheers,\nVivek Oswal\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
