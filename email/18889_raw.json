I think that when I was in school\n&gt;  there was =\r\nthis unspoken assumption that, well, to write code you have to\n&gt;  be smart =\r\nand if you&#39;re smart you&#39;ll be able to keep the whole system in\n&gt;  your head=\r\n anyway -- using tests as change detectors would be seen as a\n&gt;  sign of we=\r\nakness. I guess it doesn&#39;t help either that it took a while to\n&gt;  make rapi=\r\nd builds possible also. We had to get past batch processing, etc.\n&gt;\n&gt;  Anyw=\r\nay, I hope that the encapsulation balance changes. I&#39;ve been doing a\n&gt;  lot=\r\n thinking on it recently and I&#39;ll be presenting a session called &#39;API\n&gt;  De=\r\nsign As If Unit Testing Mattered&#39; at SDWest and SPA2007. It&#39;s really\n&gt;  all=\r\n about the fact that it&#39;s obvious that most commercial API designers\n&gt;  hav=\r\nen&#39;t thought about how to make it possible to write unit tests for\n&gt;  code =\r\nthat uses their APIs. I&#39;m going to show some glaring examples in\n&gt;  Java, C=\r\n++, and C#, and talk about some alternatives.\n\nThat&#39;s a neat name for a pre=\r\nsentation.  I had to cancel my\npresentation at SDWest unfortunately (I&#39;ll b=\r\ne speaking at QCon at that\ntime), so I&#39;ll miss it, but I hope I&#39;ll get to a=\r\nttend at some point.\n\nI am currently writing a book and this encapsulation/=\r\ntesting tension\nhas a big section dedicated to it.  Even now, I still find =\r\nmyself\nhaving to do some convincing whenever I try to tell people that it&#39;s=\r\n\nokay to remove &quot;final&quot; or make a private method &quot;package protected&quot; if\nit =\r\nmeans that it will receive more testing.\n\nI think the pendulum will swing b=\r\nack eventually and that we will find\na happy medium between the two goals.\n=\r\n\n-- \nC=E9dric\nhttp://testng.org\n\n",
