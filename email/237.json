But, often times even when I&#39;m testing a <br/>\n&gt; public method there are other methods I need to call just to see <br/>\n&gt; whether the one I&#39;m testing did what it was supposed to do.  And <br/>\n&gt; sometimes these &quot;testability methods&quot; are ones I would never want <br/>\n&gt; production code to invoke and mess up my encapsulation.  So you <br/>\n&gt; can&#39;t make em private, and you can&#39;t make em not private!  Hence <br/>\n&gt; the need for some trick like the ones that were<br/>\n&gt; suggested.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>When I&#39;m testing things that require me to call private/protected <br/>\nmethods I find it easiest to use reflection to open up a class so I <br/>\ncan call some method or check some contents of an instance.  I built <br/>\na simple class called UnitTestAccessor which uses reflection to break <br/>\nopen instances allowing me to call any method I wish or check any <br/>\ndata I need.<br/>\n<br/>\nGreat example of using this was to test a Runnable that spun in a <br/>\nloop calling some protected methods to perform analysis.  Since it <br/>\nwas hard to test across threads I used the UnitTestAccessor to <br/>\nsimulate thread calls into these protected methods.  I&#39;ll post this <br/>\nclass tomorrow as I don&#39;t have the code at my disposal right now. 8)<br/>\n<br/>\n--charlie</div>",
