( Here I mean commercial project rather than\n&gt;&gt; &gt; open-source project. )\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I tend to see it taking longer. Considering that you are least doubling \n&gt;&gt; (is this an english\n&gt;&gt; verb? :-) ) the quantity of code you write I would say this is the reason.\n&gt; \n&gt; I want to emphasize the point again (already made by Kent and J.B.) that \n&gt; this type of reasoning assumes that the limiting factor in developing \n&gt; software is typing out the code.  I encourage developers to watch themselves \n&gt; or their team for a day to observe what percentage of the time is really \n&gt; spent in typing code vs. other activities.\n&gt; \n&gt; If the limiting factor were typing then yes, writing twice as many lines of \n&gt; code would take longer.  If the limiting factor is really other activities: \n&gt; communicating with the rest of the team, understanding the problem, \n&gt; designing, finding and fixing errors, then it is not inconceivable that \n&gt; practicing TDD with JUnit can give you an overall speedup.  The trick is \n&gt; learning how to integrate JUnit as part of all of these other \n&gt; activites--activities which all software developers perform.\n&gt; \n&gt; That has been my personal experience and the experience of our teams writing \n&gt; commercial software (usually with fixed-time, fixed-price contracts) for the \n&gt; last 5 years.  Consistent JUnit testing by the whole team--using \n&gt; TDD--decreases the time it takes to produce production-ready software.\n&gt; \n&gt; Sorry but you hit one of my hot buttons.  :-)  Programming is NOT about the \n&gt; typing.\n&gt; \n&gt; Jeff\n&gt; \n\nJeff I would actually agree with you that this worked for you and the team, if you would not cut my \nsentence in half. Than you will see I am not talking about typing vs programming.\n\ncheers,\n\n./alex\n--\n.w( the_mindstorm )p.\n\nps: sorry you hit another hot button.. half sentences are half truth\n\n",
