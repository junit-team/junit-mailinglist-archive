The jsp page <br/>\n&gt; contains two text fields. In that page only i am calling bean method <br/>\n&gt; which makes a SELECT query to the DB. I am populating those two text <br/>\n&gt; fields by the result of this select query.<br/>\n&gt; All java code are embedded as a scriplet.<br/>\n&gt; So how can i go about testing jsp pages? <br/>\n&gt; Pls help me. Do any one know some good sites which explains in details <br/>\n&gt; how to test jsp pages?<br/>\n&gt; Thanks well in advance.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>When you say &#39;all java code&#39; I assume you mean only the Java code to <br/>\ninvoke the bean, right? You don&#39;t have the bean coded in the JSP <br/>\nhopefully... So, why not test the bean directly, using junit?<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you really have non-trivial amounts of Java code in the JSP, consider <br/>\nrefactoring to seperate presentation from application logic. If that&#39;s <br/>\nnot an option and you really need to write tests against the JSP itself, <br/>\nlook into Cactus.<br/>\n<br/>\nL.</div>",
