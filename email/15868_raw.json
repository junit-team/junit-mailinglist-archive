As a professional QA person with ov=\r\ner 20 years hand-on experience it is my sad duty to report that the schema =\r\nfor testing being discussed is a set-back to quality. It is the case that q=\r\nuantity is the current goal in software development. The trend to go live a=\r\nnd debug after customers start calling support is real. Developers should d=\r\no their unit testing, of course. The problem is (especially in Agile method=\r\ns) the time for QA has been cut drastically. The need for integration testi=\r\nng is greater than ever before, but the time QA has for that activity is re=\r\nduced to such short periods that that type of testing is relegated to last,=\r\n IMHO.\r\n=20\r\nAs an example, using the Agile method (scrums, sprints) where a sprint of =\r\n28 days is in place code is not ready for testing until maybe the 21 day. I=\r\nn my experience the project managers for sprints do not understand the need=\r\n for engineering specs, hence they do not exist, or if they do they are aft=\r\ner the fact. There is no time in the plan for rework of bad code. There is =\r\nno time in the sprint for rigorous QA. This leads to quantity not quality. =\r\nI admit I read this group because we use Java (moving to .net) and I wish I=\r\n had the time to learn the tools you provide. Perhaps in the future. Until =\r\nthat time and even beyond great unit testing is only and input/output type =\r\nof test. Remember that satellite that crashed in the planet Mars because di=\r\nfferent methods of measuring speed were used. Effective integration testing=\r\n would have caught that problem.\r\n=20\r\nAllowing developers the time to create good code is a partnership with QA =\r\n- allowing them the time to effectively test it. Is it a waste of time...as=\r\nk the customers if they want products that work or products that meet the g=\r\noals of project managers.\r\n=20\r\n&lt;Lurker mode on&gt;\r\n\r\nBob Bondi=20\r\nQuality Assurance Programming Technician=20\r\nSpillman Technologies, Inc.=20\r\nToll Free: 800.860.8026, ext. 6213=20\r\nLocal: 801.428.6820=20\r\nbbondi@... &lt;mailto:bbondi@...&gt; =20\r\nwww.spillman.com &lt;http://www.spillman.com/&gt; =20\r\n\r\n=20\r\n\r\n________________________________\r\n\r\nFrom: junit@yahoogroups.com [mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com] On Behalf Of J.=\r\n B.
