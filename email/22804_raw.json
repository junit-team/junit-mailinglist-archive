If I were\nlimited to =\r\nonly testing one method at a time, then I would miss a great many\nmethods. =\r\n Plus, I have to change the main method to call a different\nmethod.\nHowever=\r\n,\n- if I were to make a very complex main method, that called all of my\nmet=\r\nhods...\n- - I&#39;d have to maintain this complex main method.\n- - I&#39;d have to =\r\nadd logic to make sure that all my tests execute, even if\nthe first one thr=\r\new an exception\n- if I were to provide arguments to the main method to dete=\r\nrmine which\nmethod to test...\n- -  I&#39;d still have to call Java multiple tim=\r\nes to test all my methods.\n\n- in both cases\n- - I&#39;d have to write assertion=\r\n logic, that displays expected and actual\nvalues, so I can determine what w=\r\nas wrong.\n\nMaking main method&#39;s also corrupts the actual code with methods =\r\nthat are not\nneeded for execution.  Using separate test classes allows for =\r\neasy removal\nof test code from your deployment.  If every class is wired ti=\r\nghtly to their\ntest code, then how do you strip it out without modifying th=\r\ne code base.\n\nIf your argument is, why use JUnit if it is just another java=\r\n program that\nexecutes java code.  I see nothing prohibiting one from writi=\r\nng their own\ntest harness...  I personally would want to stay away from suc=\r\nh an endeavor,\nbut feel free to try and succeed.  May your time on the proj=\r\nect be\nenjoyable.\n\nBig Mike\n\n\n\nOn Mon, Jul 12, 2010 at 3:27 PM, dk &lt;dinesh_=\r\nhem2000@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Why do we need to use JUnits?\n&gt; If we have=\r\n to test any new class, we could create a new class, inside that\n&gt; class we=\r\n could declare a main() method and call the function to be tested\n&gt; with th=\r\ne required arguments.\n&gt; Does using JUnits provide any extra feature or addi=\r\ntional functionality\n&gt; over this way of testing,i.e, declaring main() metho=\r\nds and testing?\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been remo=\r\nved]\n\n\n",
