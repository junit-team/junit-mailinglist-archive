Mockito is interesting, in that the<br/>\nrelease notes, how-to doc, etc., are baked directly into the javadoc.<br/>\nThis didn&#39;t immediately appeal to me, because I&#39;ve found that<br/>\nlong-form text and code samples in javadoc are a pain to maintain,<br/>\nbecause of the interaction of HTML and Java syntaxes.  Do you know if<br/>\nthe mockito team uses tooling that makes it easier?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; The process would then be a case generating the javadoc into the site<br/>\n&gt; repo on github, committing and publishing it.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I think this should be as automated as possible.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yes.  Of the code I have personally written for JUnit over the last 8<br/>\nmonths, easily over half has been automation of build, release, and<br/>\ndocumentation.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; JUnit is a bit off on<br/>\n&gt; it&#39;s founder&#39;s XP credentials.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>To be fair, to my knowledge, no one&#39;s getting paid to work 40-hour<br/>\nweeks on JUnit, so other XP practices also have to bend.  :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; , and part of that seems to be an allergy<br/>\n&gt; to Maven.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;m not sure about allergy.  JUnit predates the first glimmer of maven<br/>\nby at least three years, and we&#39;ve been fairly enthusiastic about<br/>\ncommunity contributions to make working with JUnit and maven easier.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; We should be able to release JUnit from a button on a build<br/>\n&gt; server :)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Donations toward acquiring cycles happily accepted.  ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\n   David Saff<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; On 08/09/2011 22:43, Stefan Birkner wrote:<br/>\n&gt;&gt; The information about JUnit is across three different places: junit.org, junit.sourceforge.net and github.

This makes it easier to find the information and JUnit would look more professional. IMHO the github pages are a good place for the JUnit documentation, because we can use all the git(hub) features for creating the documentation.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; What do you think?<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Stefan Birkner<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; ------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Yahoo!
