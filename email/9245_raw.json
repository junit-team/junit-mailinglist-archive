How to write test case?\r\nTo: junit@yahoogroups.com\r\nMIME-Version: 1.0\r\nFrom: Veny handoko &lt;vichandoko@...&gt;\r\nX-Yahoo-Group-Post: member; u=74115201\r\nX-Yahoo-Profile: vichandoko\r\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit\r\nX-eGroups-Approved-By: vbossica &lt;vladimir@...&gt; via web; 30 Aug 2003 01:47:46 -0000\r\n\r\nHi all,\n \nI am new to Junit and i am trying to write test case on class that involve database.\n \nHere is snapshot of my design.\n \npublic class BusinessObject{\n    public boolean methodCall(int key){\n        DatabaseHelper dbHelper = new DatabaseHelper();\n        Vector v = dbHelper.getList();\n        if(v.size() == 0){\n            return false;\n        }else{\n            return true;\n        } \n    }\n}\n \npublic class DatabaseHelper{\n    Connection con;\n    ...\n \n    public Vector getList(){\n        Vector v = new Vector();\n        //perform query to database to retrieve a list of values and add into Vector\n        return v;\n    }\n}\n \nHow to write a test case for the method inside BusinessObject? For instance, if i want to test BusinessObject.methodCall on condition where getList() return an empty list, how should it be done? I am not expected to empty my database to do this, right? Is the any way to mock my DatabaseHelper object? How to do it?\n \nI&#39;ve look at MockObject. but the sample given on mockObject website  requires me to pass in a Connection to DatabaseHelper, which i personally think it not quite a good design considering modularity. Any other alternatives? \n \nI believe this is quite common problem/question. Can somebody send me a sample test case if available. Thank you very much.\n \nCheers,\n \nVeny\n\n\n\n---------------------------------\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
