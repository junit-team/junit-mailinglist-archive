I want to write test cases that reference interfaces only<br/>\nas I want to publish them as part of a spec  they are to define the<br/>\nsemantics of classes. For instance, I want to write a test case for<br/>\nlists like this:<br/>\n<br/>\nclass TestList extends TestCase {<br/>\n\tList testedObject = null;<br/>\n\tpublic void test1() {<br/>\n\t  testedObject.clear();<br/>\n\t  testedObject.add(&quot;object&quot;);<br/>\n\t  assertTrue(1==testedObject.size());<br/>\n\t}<br/>\n}<br/>\n<br/>\nHow can I use TestList without subclassing it and explicitly<br/>\ninitialising  testedObject in setUp() (or another method using the<br/>\nJUnit4 annotation). In other words, is there an elegant dependency<br/>\ninjection mechanism that can be used here? I could use a constructor<br/>\nto set the implementation class instance,  but I understand that JUnit<br/>\ntest runners use reflection to instantiate test cases. A solution<br/>\nwould be a test runner that uses an map associating test case classes<br/>\nwith implementation classes (to be tested), and uses this info to<br/>\ninstantiate the test cases. Is there anything like this out there?<br/>\nThanks in advance for any idea!<br/>\n<br/>\nJens</div>",
