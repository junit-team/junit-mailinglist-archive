Alternatively, you could \nset the context class loader for *most* of your tests to include both \nclasses, while that of the class loading tests would omit them.  The \nkey is to avoid those classes *ever* being loaded by the primordial \nclass loader.\n\nYou can certainly write a class loader that *doesn&#39;t* delegate loading \nto the parent/primordial, but that path is fraught with exceptions and \nerrors (of the ClassCast and Linkage types) and painstaking to get \nexactly right.\n\n\nOn Sep 21, 2004, at 10:00 AM, Russell Gold wrote:\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Does anybody have a good way to test behavior that depends on code in\n&gt; different classloaders communicating? That is, we have a client that\n&gt; should only use the classes in one jar talking to a server that should\n&gt; only use the classes in another jar. It is trivial to test the\n&gt; communications if I smush the classpaths together, but I want a\n&gt; sensible way to restrict each of the parts to its own classloader,\n&gt; preferably without preventing the suite from having both sets of\n&gt; classes in its *default* classloader...\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n",
