I&#39;ve learned a lot on these lists, and try<br/>\nevery now & then to give something back.  Being blasted when I do<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t make it any easier.  It&#39;s a good thing I have a sense of humor<br/>\n(granted it&#39;s obtuse at times, and generally off-color).<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I hope that my other reply<br/>\n&gt; made it clearer what I think Dave was getting at: most people<br/>\n&gt; misunderstand (as I did for two years) why the class TestCase is <br/>\n&gt; meant to embody a test fixture. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Exactly<br/>\n<br/>\nDave</div>",
