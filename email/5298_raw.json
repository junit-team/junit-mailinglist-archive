The absence of \n&gt;&gt; a test indicates &quot;undefined behavior&quot; and you shouldn&#39;t rely \n&gt;&gt; on undefined \n&gt;&gt; behavior. \n&gt;\n&gt;How can the absence of a test specify anything reliably?  (How does \n&gt;the user know that you&#39;re trying to say that the behavior is undefined\n\n&gt;and that you didn&#39;t just forget to test that case?)\n\nThe user should assume, in my opinion, that unspecified behavior is --\nwell -- unspecified. I would assume it. If I am unsure what your code\ndoes under specific conditions, I have some choices. I can:\n\n* Read your documentation and trust it.\n* Ask you directly.\n* Look at your tests and find one that covers the condition or\nsomething sufficiently similar.\n* Write a Learning Test and discover the answer for myself.\n\nI could read your documentation, but I may not trust it. I would\ncertainly be able to trsut the outcome of any of the other three, so\nI&#39;m not sure whether the first is that solid an option, all other\nthings being equal.\n\nTo answer the direct question: the absence of a test specifies, by\ndefault, that behavior is undefined. Add a test -- no matter who writes\nit -- and we can define the behavior unambiguously. I prefer\nunambiguous definitions to potentially ambiguous ones by default, so in\nthe worst case, I&#39;d probably just write the test. I have tried to do\nthis without just writing the test before and regretted the wasted\ntime, so I have decided to learn from my experience.\n\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Because tests, being code, can&#39;t relate code to external concepts.\n \n&gt;&gt; &gt; \n&gt;&gt; &gt; (A specification can say that a function f returns the\nmathematical\n&gt;&gt; &gt; sum of two given integers subject to the limitations of 32-bit\n&gt;&gt; &gt; signed binary arithmetic.  How can a test say something like\nthat?)\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; I would think that the name of the method says it, \n&gt;\n&gt;Then you completely missed the example I just gave.  \n\nI did not: I think &quot;f&quot; is a ridiculous name and would have to question\nany author who names a function like the above &quot;f&quot;.\n\n&gt;Note the number\n&gt;of terms necessary to define the behavior of the function.  Would you \n&gt;ever name a function with that level of precision or description?  \n\nThis does not parse. I thought I specified three tests that zero in\nquite quickly on the behavior of this method. What was wrong with them?\nIs something missing?\n\n&gt;(Don&#39;t use that exact example, since 32-bit binary values are already \n&gt;defined in Java.)\n\nI don&#39;t see how this matters: are you suggesting that we need an\nexample of a method using parameters that are &quot;not defined&quot; in Java?\n\n&gt;&gt; I, for one, would be very interested to see Sun&#39;s servlet API \n&gt;&gt; described in a \n&gt;&gt; test suite.\n&gt;\n&gt;I would hate to see _only_ a test suite.\n\nWith a gun to my head and asked to choose between Javadoc and a test\nsuite, I choose the test suite. I assume that the test suite was ample\nto provide the developers with the necessary confidence to release\ntheir code; otherwise, I simply wouldn&#39;t use the software at all.\n\n&gt;You know, this makes me think of things like Ada and some network\n&gt;protocols, which have a detailed specification _and_ a test suite.\n\nEven better.\n\n&gt;Having just the test suite would be a horrible way to learn Ada or a\n&gt;protocol enough to implement it, or even just to use it.\n\nDo you have experience to back up this statement? I started learning\nSmalltalk using a combination of:\n\n* Well-named classes\n* A primer on the syntax\n* SUnit\n\nI found it to be quite a good experience, actually. When learning a\nprogramming language, it is more important to try to write tests than\nit is to read tests. Writing tests in an unknown language allows me to\nexplore the language without being bogged down in the details of I/O,\nwhich can create more questions than they answer. Think about all the\nnonsense one has to go over to explain &quot;public static void\nmain(String[] args)&quot; to a novice Java programmer... would it not be\nbetter to just explain how to call methods and assertEquals()?\n\n&gt;(Actually, doesn&#39;t Sun have a J2EE test suite?)\n\nNo idea. If they do, I&#39;d like to see it.\n\nJ. B.
