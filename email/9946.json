When I first started writing<br/>\nJunit tests I had many assertions in my test methods.  Lately, as I<br/>\nlearn more about TDD, I&#39;ve been trying to limit my unit tests to only<br/>\none assertion per test method.  I find that by having only one assertion<br/>\nper test method it keeps my tests much more focused and easier to<br/>\nunderstand.  Once I get more than 2 or 3 assertions in a test method I<br/>\nstart to look at how I can split that one test up into 2 or more tests.<br/>\nGive it a try, you might find that you like it.<br/>\n<br/>\nKris</div>",
