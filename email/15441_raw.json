In my current\n&gt; project, we are using webwork/spring/hibernate trioes.And in architecture\n&gt; view, there is a web controller/ service / dao three layer logic separation.\n&gt; And there is another important layer called domain model. Sevice layer\n&gt; usually delegate to domain model to complete it&#39;s service and it should be a\n&gt; thin layer. My question is how to test the web && service && domain\n&gt; model.After i have tested a particular business logic in domain logic, do i\n&gt; need to test corresponding conditions in service layer and web\n&gt; layer.For example, in traditional auction application(citing caveatemptor\n&gt; application in book &quot;Hibernate In Action&quot;):\n\nI didn&#39;t read your code, but here&#39;s a short answer to your question.\n\nWhen I write web applications in Java, my &quot;Data Access Layer&quot; is a bunch \nof interfaces called XXXRepository. Each interface provides access to an \nAggregate Root of objects (see _Domain Driven Design_ for more \ninformation on aggregate roots). This way I can test the Business Logic \nlayer with Test Doubles (search for &quot;test automation patterns meszaros&quot;) \nstanding in for the Repository interfaces. By doing this, I can run all \nthose tests in memory. Only a handful of the Repository tests actually \ntouch a real database.\n\nI also add an Application Layer that knows about the application, but \nnot HTTP/HTML. This way I can test my application with a Java API that&#39;s \neasily adapted to the web. Most of my tests go through this API with \nonly a handful of tests that check whether I convert HTTP requests to \nApplication requests properly.\n\nFor a longer answer, read _JUnit Recipes_.\n-- \nJ.
