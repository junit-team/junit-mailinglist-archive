Looking at the code now, it looks lik=\r\ne a much easier\nfeature, perhaps for early 4.8.\n\nQuestion: would you rather=\r\n see the tests as ignored, or not see them at all?\n\n   David Saff\n\nOn Thu, =\r\nJun 18, 2009 at 4:47 PM, William Pietri&lt;william@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi!=\r\n There&#39;s some functionality I had built for myself in the land of\n&gt; JUnit 3=\r\n, and I&#39;m trying to figure out how best to replicate it in JUnit\n&gt; 4. Let m=\r\ne explain it in two parts.\n&gt;\n&gt; The first part is something that finds all m=\r\ny tests (by walking the\n&gt; filesystem) and then runs them.\n&gt;\n&gt; The second pa=\r\nrt is a way for me to segregate different sorts of tests so\n&gt; that I can ru=\r\nn them conditionally. I previously used annotations,\n&gt; including something =\r\nakin to the @Ignore annotation that I&#39;m pleased to\n&gt; see is now included. I=\r\n also had something like @Category(&quot;slow&quot;), which\n&gt; allowed me to kick slow=\r\n tests out of the common target that developers run.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; For the first pa=\r\nrt, I found this chunk of code, so I didn&#39;t have to\n&gt; write that myself:\n&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; http://burtbeckwith.com/blog/?p=3D52\n&gt;\n&gt; But now that I&#39;m looking to add =\r\nthe second part to it, it seems awkward\n&gt; enough that I wonder if I&#39;m going=\r\n about it wrong.\n&gt;\n&gt; Within this structure, it looks like I could use per-c=\r\nlass annotations\n&gt; to kick entire classes out of the set of tests to run. B=\r\nut is there a\n&gt; reasonable way I could use annotations on individual method=\r\ns to include\n&gt; or exclude them from the set of tests to run?\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks,\n=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; William\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
