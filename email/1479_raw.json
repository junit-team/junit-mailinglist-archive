The only thing is that it is in a state of flux.  I will post the\nworking copy.  My current copy has gone through a lot of refactoring, but\nisn&#39;t finished.  The copy I post will not have any separation of\nmodel/view/controller since it was never meant to be distributed (it was a\ntwo day proof-of-concept).  However, that being said, this is the copy that\nwe have been using for three months.  I will also include a readme for\ngetting this installed in VAJ.\n\n-Jason\n\n    &gt; -----Original Message-----\n    &gt; From: Mathieu Gervais [mailto:egoine_@...]\n    &gt; Sent: Tuesday, June 12, 2001 8:42 AM\n    &gt; To: junit@yahoogroups.com\n    &gt; Subject: Re:VAJ metric utility (was: [junit] Best \n    &gt; Practice for Tests ?)\n    &gt; \n    &gt; \n    &gt; From: Jason Rogers\n    &gt; [...]\n    &gt; &gt;Well put!  This is something I have often alluded to in \n    &gt; my own company, but\n    &gt; &gt;still eludes me frequently.  For that reason I wrote a \n    &gt; utility that\n    &gt; &gt;integrates with VAJ to keep the metrics coming as far as \n    &gt; what is tested and\n    &gt; &gt;what is not.  This is not a code coverage analysis; all \n    &gt; it does is report\n    &gt; on\n    &gt; &gt;which classes are tested and which are not, and of the \n    &gt; ones that are - how\n    &gt; &gt;much of their public interface is tested.\n    &gt; \n    &gt; Would you be willing to publish such an utility. I think \n    &gt; it might be usefull\n    &gt; to the community. (At least I know _I_ wanted to write \n    &gt; something that list\n    &gt; which class has a TestClass written for and which don&#39;t). \n    &gt; Your stuff looks\n    &gt; cool.\n    &gt; \n    &gt; mathieu\n    &gt; \n    &gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n    &gt; junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n    &gt;  \n    &gt; \n    &gt; Your use of Yahoo!
