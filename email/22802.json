    "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2049000181\">Hi dk,<br/>\nYes, it is possible to write your tests by adding a class with a main method<br/>\nwhich just calls the function you want to test. However, JUnit provides you<br/>\nwith a lot of features which you would end up developing for yourself<br/>\nanyway.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor example, you will have many of these &quot;main&quot; methods which will compare<br/>\nthe two values (the value which you expect and the actual value from your<br/>\nfunction). JUnit provides assertEquals methods for you. JUnit also gives you<br/>\nthe ability to organize your test cases into test classes and test suites.<br/>\nThere are a lot of tools which also utilize JUnit. For example, JUnit is<br/>\nintegrated into many popular Java IDEs and works with most continuous<br/>\nintegration environments (such as CruiseControl).<br/>\n<br/>\nIn other words, if you write all your tests in your own main method, you<br/>\nwill probably find yourself, slowly &quot;re-inventing&quot; all the features of<br/>\nJUnit. As JUnit advances, you will be able to take advantage of the new<br/>\nfeatures which the community provides. You also have access to the many<br/>\nother people who use JUnit and who have experience writing unit tests.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck,<br/>\nDennis<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Mon, Jul 12, 2010 at 5:27 PM, dk &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dinesh_hem2000@...\">dinesh_hem2000@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Why do we need to use JUnits?<br/>\n&gt; If we have to test any new class, we could create a new class, inside that<br/>\n&gt; class we could declare a main() method and call the function to be tested<br/>\n&gt; with the required arguments.<br/>\n&gt; Does using JUnits provide any extra feature or additional functionality<br/>\n&gt; over this way of testing,i.e, declaring main() methods and testing?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed] </span></blockquote></div>",
