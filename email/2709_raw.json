There is a link for\nsubscribing to the user list (http://jakarta.apache.org/site/mail.html) as\nwell as browsing the archives\n(http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=ant-user&r=1&w=2).\n\n    &gt; &gt;     &gt;   &lt;target name=&quot;test&quot; \n    &gt; depends=&quot;compile.tests,run.mail.server&quot;\n    &gt; &gt;     &gt; if=&quot;junit.present&quot;\n    &gt; &gt;     &gt;           description=&quot;Runs the JUnit test cases&quot;&gt;\n    &gt; &gt;     &gt; ...\n    &gt; &gt;     &gt;\n    &gt; &gt;     &gt; When I run Ant, without the mail server running, it\n    &gt; &gt;     &gt; displays my error\n    &gt; &gt;     &gt; output that\n    &gt; &gt;     &gt; indicates that the connection to the server failed, bu\n    &gt; &gt;     &gt; then it continues\n    &gt; &gt;     &gt; on. What\n    &gt; &gt;     &gt; do I need to do, to cause the build to stop, if \n    &gt; the check fails?\n    &gt; &gt; \n    &gt; &gt; &#39;haltonfailure=yes&#39; and/or &#39;haltonerror=yes&#39; should work here.\n    &gt; \n    &gt; Hmmm. I tried both of these and it says that the \n    &gt; attributes are not\n    &gt; supported\n    &gt; by this task I&#39;ve created.\n\nYou have to add those attributes specifically to your script.  What I was\nreferring to was running the &lt;junit/&gt; task that supports these attributes.\nMiscommunication...\n \n    &gt; I just took the simple sample application that was shown in the\n    &gt; documentation\n    &gt; and substituted the guts of the execute method with my \n    &gt; logic. My class\n    &gt; is a\n    &gt; subclass of Task, as is the sample in the docs. Any idea how I add\n    &gt; support\n    &gt; for these attributes? Or better yet any pointers to \n    &gt; documentation on how\n    &gt; to\n    &gt; customize Ant?\n\nAnt has a very nice documentation package.  There is a doc/ directory in\nyour Ant install_dir.\n\n    &gt; &gt;     &gt; Also, can anyone give me some ideas as to how to \n    &gt; kick off the mail\n    &gt; &gt;     &gt; server? It is\n    &gt; &gt;     &gt; a Java app. I guess I could do a &lt;java ...&gt; line, but how\n    &gt; &gt;     &gt; do I make that\n    &gt; &gt;     &gt; conditional?\n    &gt; &gt;     &gt; Is there a way to set some &quot;property&quot;, as a result of the\n    &gt; &gt;     &gt; &quot;dixiecheck&quot;,\n    &gt; &gt;     &gt; such that\n    &gt; &gt;     &gt; this app would be invoked based on that \n    &gt; &quot;property&quot; or &quot;condition&quot;?\n    &gt; &gt; \n    &gt; &gt; does &lt;dixiecheck/&gt; startup DixieMail if it is not \n    &gt; running?  If so, make the\n    &gt; &gt; server a singleton and &quot;away you go.&quot;\n    &gt; \n    &gt; It doesn&#39;t yet, but I guess I could. The server is a third party\n    &gt; application\n    &gt; that I downloaded and use, so I don&#39;t want to play with \n    &gt; their source.\n    &gt; \n    &gt; I was thinking of two ways to kick off the server (any \n    &gt; other ideas are\n    &gt; welcome):\n    &gt; \n    &gt; A) In the DixieCheck class, if the server is not running, \n    &gt; launch it. I\n    &gt; must\n    &gt;    admit, I&#39;m new to Java, so I&#39;m not sure of the \n    &gt; appropriate way to do\n    &gt; this\n    &gt;    (start another Java application from inside an app, \n    &gt; like C&#39;s system()\n    &gt; call).\n    &gt; \n    &gt; B) Have the dixiecheck Ant task somehow (how?) set a \n    &gt; &quot;property&quot;and then\n    &gt; have\n    &gt;    another Ant task that forks java and runs the \n    &gt; mailserver, if the\n    &gt; &quot;property&quot;\n    &gt;    is set (can I do a &lt;java fork=&quot;yes&quot; classname=&quot;...&quot;\n    &gt; classpath=&quot;...&quot;&gt;).\n    &gt; \n    &gt; Any comments on either of these two? Any other \n    &gt; suggestions? Any pointers\n    &gt; on\n    &gt; A and/or B?\n\nA simple thing to implement right now is to have your task directly call the\n&lt;java/&gt; task (in your code base) with a fork attribute set to true.  That\nway you don&#39;t have to know anything about launching processes.  If you want\nto learn how to launch a process, it shouldn&#39;t take you too long.  It&#39;s very\nsimple in Java, and there are a couple of tried and true ways of doing it.\nLet&#39;s take it off-line if you need more help.\n\nAs for (B), you would have to add the &lt;property/&gt; support to your task (I\nthink).  Once that is in, you just write a property tag inside the xml\ndefinition of the custom task.  Some other target can invoke the\n&lt;conditional/&gt; on that property or use the if/unless attribute on the\ntarget.\n\nHTH.\n-Jason\n\n\n",
