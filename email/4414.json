Rainsberger&quot; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &quot;If I didn&#39;t spend 80 hours writing these tests, I could spend my time<br/>\n&gt; &gt; writing each test as I need it and the rest of the time writing new<br/>\n&gt; &gt; code. Given what I know about the code, I won&#39;t be any faster writing<br/>\n&gt; &gt; tests whether I write them all at once or as I need them. With that in<br/>\n&gt; &gt; mind, what would you like me to do? In the worst case, I need all the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; tests up front and end up writing them now anyway. It looks like you<br/>\n&gt; &gt; win.&quot; How does that sound, everyone?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I think it&#39;s important to understand the value of test coverage as<br/>\n&gt;perceived by the person requesting those tests.  In other words, if you<br/>\n&gt;had automatically-generated tests for all the code, how might that help<br/>\n&gt;you?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Me, personally? Not at all. I have worked with generated code long enough <br/>\nnot to trust it. That&#39;s a personal bias that is perhaps unnecessarily <br/>\ndifficult for people to get around.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne, in general? Automatically-generated tests could help by providing a <br/>\nrefactoring safety net before the programmer was able to understand and <br/>\ntherefore craft by hand the same tests. It also has the downside of <br/>\nabsolving the programmer of the responsibility of understanding what the <br/>\ntests are doing -- this is because generated code is usually very difficult <br/>\nto read -- rendering their communication value quite low.<br/>\n<br/>\nEven if the autogen tests worked, the programmer would still likely want to <br/>\nreplace those tests with ones he can understand, over time. Then they would <br/>\nbe great. The problem is simple: I can&#39;t trust them enough. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nJ. B.
