These tests are too <br/>\nslow to effectively participate in minute-to-minute TDD, in my <br/>\nexperience. (Contrary to the practice espoused in Contributing to <br/>\nEclipse, otherwise a really great book.) Unfortunately, SWT is built in <br/>\na way that prevents you from creating any user-interface element without <br/>\nat least opening a window to display it in.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Google so far says &#39;not really&#39;.
