The\nJUnit site maintains a lot of us=\r\neful information and links to other\nresources. Many of the articles there a=\r\nre directed towards the\nbeginner and will help you greatly as you learn abo=\r\nut JUnit. Google is\nuseful when there&#39;s something you need, but don&#39;t know =\r\nwhat it is.\nJust type a description in, press enter and see how much help i=\r\nt can\nbe. I&#39;ve found quite a few useful things that way. Another tip with\nG=\r\noogle is to search on the specific error message that you have, often\nyou&#39;l=\r\nl find forum discussions about that exact error, with a good\nchance of a so=\r\nlution being given as well.\n\nAs you learn and start having questions, you w=\r\nill also find the JUnit\nFAQ very helpful. The questions that it answers rea=\r\nlly are the\nfrequent ones that most of us had asked or wondered about and M=\r\nike\nClark does a wonderful job of collating it. Here is a link:\n\nhttp://jun=\r\nit.sourceforge.net/doc/faq/faq.htm\n\nWhen you are ready to start asking more=\r\n questions on the JUnit mailing\nlist, please consider following all of the =\r\nadvice in Eric Raymond&#39;s\nvery helpful document: &quot;How to ask questions the s=\r\nmart way&quot;, available\nat his website. Here is a link:\n\nhttp://www.catb.org/~=\r\nesr/faqs/smart-questions.html\n\nAs far as books are concerned, I recommend P=\r\nragmatic Unit Testing by\nHunt and Thomas for beginners. JUnit recipes by Ra=\r\ninsberger is good\nonce you&#39;re past the basics. There are other good books o=\r\nut there, but\nthese are my recommendations.\n\nI hope that this helps.\n\nSimon=\r\n\n\n--\nwww.simonpeter.org\n\n",
