I work at a company that makes Medical Devices. The\nFD=\r\nA, as we&#39;re told by QA, requires the deposition of all tests. So even\nPass&#39;=\r\ning tests must have their actual results reported on. We do this\ncurrently =\r\nwith manual/human tests.\n\nIf the report could say something like:\nTest ID S=\r\ntatus Expected Actual\n123 Pass Smith Smith\n456 Pass Value &gt; 10 12\n789 Fail =\r\nValue =3D &quot;abc&quot; xyz\n...\n\nThis report would be stored (for many years) for a=\r\nudit purposes.\n\nNow being a newbie, maybe there is a way to do this I don&#39;t=\r\n know about - but\nvery useful.\n\nMark\n\n--- In junit@yahoogroups. &lt;mailto:jun=\r\nit%40yahoogroups.com&gt; com,\n&quot;toalexsmail&quot; &lt;toalexsmail@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; --- I=\r\nn junit@yahoogroups. &lt;mailto:junit%40yahoogroups.com&gt; com, Robert\nWenner &lt;r=\r\nobert.wenner@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; On Monday 09 June 2008 21:18, C=E9dric Beust =\r\nwrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If I have to go through umpteen thousand lines of log, I may=\r\n as well\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; test everything manually.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Nobody says you have=\r\n to, but the fact that your tests pass doesn&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; &gt; guarantee that you are=\r\n testing what you think you are testing.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Well. If the log is impor=\r\ntant, I have to go through it, or I miss \n&gt; &gt; something important. If it is=\r\n not important (and I don&#39;t have to go \n&gt; &gt; through it) I can skip it altog=\r\nether. So what do you mean when you\n&gt; say I \n&gt; &gt; don&#39;t have to go through i=\r\nt?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; I have read carefully all the posts so far and I tend to agree=\r\n with\n&gt; Robert. I am wonder whether I miss something important too.\n&gt; I wan=\r\nt to be clear, so I will take one step backward. What is the MAIN\n&gt; purpose=\r\n of JUnit? The answer is to be able to write AUTOMATIC unit\n&gt; test. Unit te=\r\nst should be written is the correct way, that is\n&gt; correctly design. This h=\r\nas nothing to do with logging. Making unit\n&gt; test AUTOMATIC contradict usin=\r\ng logging.\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;you can skip the this paragraph&gt;\n&gt; I want to step aside fo=\r\nr a while. Let assume that you&#39;re not using\n&gt; JUnit at all and write small =\r\nmain function to test. I don&#39;t want to\n&gt; counter why you shouldn&#39;t do this,=\r\n let focus on what tools you do use\n&gt; in this approach. In the most cases y=\r\nou will add System.out both to\n&gt; the code and to the main. If you&#39;re using =\r\nC++, for instance, you will\n&gt; use preprocessor to switch on or off these ou=\r\ntput to the console. More\n&gt; advance option will be to use logging mechanism=\r\n and to change it\n&gt; configuration depends on the environment your program r=\r\nun (that is to\n&gt; turn on many of your log statement only in development). E=\r\nverything is\n&gt; great until your program is actually fails. Again, from the =\r\nexperience\n&gt; it is almost always the case that existing System.outs are not=\r\n enough,\n&gt; that you need more information or you should add some more outpu=\r\nt\n&gt; early in the code. So, in this point you have to option to run your\n&gt; p=\r\nrogram AGAIN with debugger or to add more System.outs and to run it\n&gt; as is=\r\n. In both cases it can be the case that you should rerun your\n&gt; program aga=\r\nin (if you use debugger you could simply not pointed out\n&gt; when some data c=\r\nhanged and in the System.out case you can figure out\n&gt; that you need more S=\r\nystem.outs).\n&gt; \n&gt; From the paragraph above one should conclude that when on=\r\ne write unit\n&gt; test there is 2 different phases. First is to write them dow=\r\nn in the\n&gt; hope that everything will be ok (it doesn&#39;t mean, that you desig=\r\nn\n&gt; should be poor or you shouldn&#39;t supply appropriate messages to assert\n&gt;=\r\n statements etc) and the second phase is to rerun your test if your\n&gt; test =\r\nfails. Lets see how logging will help you.\n&gt; \n&gt; In the first phase I see th=\r\ne only purpose using logs is for &#39;sanity\n&gt; check&#39; that is to ensure that yo=\r\nu actually test what your think is you\n&gt; test. If you want to make somethin=\r\ng more than just &#39;sanity check&#39; you\n&gt; should write unit test to your unit t=\r\nest, that is pretty silly.\n&gt; Moreover, you need to make such &#39;sanity check&#39;=\r\n only when you actually\n&gt; write this test. For this purpose logging is appr=\r\nopriate approach, IMHO.\n&gt; \n&gt; In the second phase, when you rerun your unit =\r\ntest when it fails, you\n&gt; should consider to add more assert statement and =\r\nmore clearly\n&gt; diagnostic messages first. When you done and you don&#39;t see h=\r\now to\n&gt; improve the design (recall I consider that design is correct) you c=\r\nan\n&gt; add log statement manually. But in this case they will not be part of\n=\r\n&gt; new mechanism, because no more asserts will be added. So this new\n&gt; featu=\r\nre will not be in use!\n&gt; \n&gt; Using logging in the assert statement ONLY for =\r\n&#39;sanity check&#39; is\n&gt; overkill, I think. As for me I make such &#39;sanity check&#39;=\r\n in the\n&gt; following way. First of all, I use log4j MANUALLY that is as addi=\r\ntion\n&gt; to JUnit asserts. They don&#39;t duplicate what asserts does they supply=\r\n\n&gt; additional information, such as what assertion was already done. In\n&gt; th=\r\nis case when assertion will fail afterwards I can look on the log to\n&gt; see =\r\nin what part of unit test it happened and what tests passed. I go\n&gt; even fu=\r\nrther and use JDK 1.4 assert statement to document\n&gt; precondition, postcond=\r\nition and invariants both in the code and in the\n&gt; unit test.\n&gt; \n&gt; The bott=\r\nom line is that I see the sense using logs as a COMPLETION to\n&gt; the JUnit a=\r\nnd only for &#39;sanity check&#39;. This use is not duplicates\n&gt; JUnit assert state=\r\nments and could be written manually.\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this mes=\r\nsage have been removed]\n\n\n",
