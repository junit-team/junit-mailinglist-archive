However, whilst JUnit is fine for testing &quot;normal&quot;\nclasses I&#39;m really stuck on how to apply it to the application I&#39;m building.\n\nThis application is agent-based and is therefore distributed,\nmulti-threaded, asynchronous and acts in response to incoming messages and\nuser interactions.  It sits on top of an agent platform which makes it\nslightly harder to form tests (you must start the platform before any tests\nwill work).\n\nI understand that xUnit tests are normally focused on individual classes but\nin my case the classes include the agent itself, several behaviours (i.e.\ntasks), and utility classes.  The utility classes are quite easy to test as\nthey are usually standard classes devoid of agent complications.  The Agent\nhas very few methods of interest since it responds to messages placed in a\nqueue from either the GUI or other agents.  Each behaviour maintains an\ninternal state which changes in response to messages and can be\ncharacterised by either WAITING_FOR_USER, WAITING_FOR_MESSAGE,\nPERFORMING_ACTION, or SENDING_MESSAGE.  So my ideal tests would be to ensure\nthat the agent makes the correct state transitions in response to\nvalid/invalid messages and that it does this in each of the concurrent\nbehaviours.\n\nNow that I actually write all this down it does seem kinda difficult!!  But\nI think many of the problems exist in systems like Jini, etc.\n\nGiven the large amount of distributed systems work involved in most\napplications today I was hoping that someone would have typical patterns for\ntesting these systems.  Any ideas?\n\nMany thanks,\n\n\n\tJamie\n\n\r\n------=_NextPart_000_0045_01C05F77.78E870E0\r\nContent-Type: application/octet-stream;\n\tname=&quot;Jamie Lawrence.vcf&quot;\r\nContent-Disposition: attachment;\n\tfilename=&quot;Jamie Lawrence.vcf&quot;\r\n\r\n[ Attachment content not displayed ]\r\n------=_NextPart_000_0045_01C05F77.78E870E0--\r\n\n",
