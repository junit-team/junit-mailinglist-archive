I would expect it to be something more<br/>\n&gt; than a way of avoiding that kind of boilerplate.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I just explained that in my previous reply. When the boilerplate that is<br/>\navoided is so excessive, the syntactic sugar itself becomes a valuable<br/>\nfeature.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; As an example of the kind of thing I think a class rule would enable,<br/>\n&gt; is that it might allow the rule to dynamically pass values to the<br/>\n&gt; test class&#39;s constructor based on some dynamic criteria (say a souped<br/>\n&gt; up version of Parameterized)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>No. Test class instantiation occurs per-method, not per-class, thus<br/>\nclass-level is not where it can be changed.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; or perhaps change the runner that will run the tests,<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>No. The Runner is what invokes the rules, so rules can&#39;t change the runner.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; or dynamically disable certain tests (say based on the OS the<br/>\n&gt; test is running on).<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>A class rule could skip an entire class of tests, if you wanted it to.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Something that is not possible with an @BeforeClass<br/>\n&gt; or @AfterClass annotation.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>The ability to package a common class-level setup/teardown behaviour and<br/>\nre-use it in many places is what rules provide over embedded<br/>\nbefore/after methods. That&#39;s very useful by itself, and they don&#39;t have<br/>\nto do anything more to justify their existence.<br/>\n<br/>\nMax.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",
