Is this really what you want? If the price comes back as<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; 7.93, that&#39;s good enough?! No way.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; That depends on your need. Using longs to represent everything in <br/>\n&gt; pennies fails when you are attempting to use multiple currencies. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>&lt;snip-explanation /&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nAgreed. I was merely suggesting something better, but simple, rather <br/>\nthan a real solution, which would involve a Money class of some kind.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;       Now all of this could be avoided if you accept 4 decimal digits <br/>\n&gt; for money - 1 away from your significant should cancel any rounding <br/>\n&gt; errors, or you can get each transaction as an individual. However, if <br/>\n&gt; you only get a lump long for the amount then it won&#39;t work.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Even if you keep 4 decimal digits, if you multiply that value by, say, <br/>\n100,000 (or worse, 92,582), you still lose accuracy.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I have found BigDecimal is actually very accurate when you initially <br/>\n&gt; load values into them using Strings [new BigDecimal(&quot;10.56&quot;)], so I have <br/>\n&gt; been using them.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I haven&#39;t tried that, myself, so I should. Still, if one likes the Whole <br/>\nValue pattern, one prefers to have a Money class, that knows about <br/>\nmoney-related issues and can do money-related things.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for the alternatives. They&#39;re /always/ valuable.<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJ. B.
