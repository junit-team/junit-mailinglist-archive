(I&#39;m not being facetious; it&#39;s true.)\n\nI also doubt your implication in the last paragraph. A trivial example \nwould be a class with mostly query methods. I don&#39;t have a good \nnontrivial example at that moment.\n\nAlso keep in mind the difference between an insane object, for which a \ngiven operation might be undefined or worthy of rejecting, and a sane \nobject in a certain state in which a given operation might do nothing \ninteresting.\n-- \nJ.
