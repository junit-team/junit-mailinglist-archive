I&#39;ll leave aside discu=\r\nssion that you can&#39;t\n&gt; always isolate components from the infrastructure be=\r\ncause it is a\n&gt; separate topic and in fact quite achievable in my opinion.\n=\r\n&gt;\n&gt;   Now, for each isolated unit of code we have an unit test. When\n&gt; appl=\r\nication size grows complexity of unit tests would grow linearly and\n&gt; not e=\r\nxponential and as a result close to 100% test coverage is not any\n&gt; more di=\r\nfficult to achieve for large codebase then for a small codebase.\n\n\nI guess =\r\nit depends what you mean by &quot;code coverage&quot;.\n\nIf you mean &quot;that segment of =\r\ncode was run by at least one test&quot;, then yes,\nit&#39;s not &quot;too hard&quot; (albeit s=\r\ntill sometimes too complex to be worth the\ntrouble).\n\nIf you mean &quot;all poss=\r\nible paths of execution have been tested&quot;, then it&#39;s\nclearly impossible bec=\r\nause it&#39;s exponential with the number of branches in\nyour code (see &quot;cyclom=\r\natic complexity&quot;).\n\n\n--\nC=E9dric\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have =\r\nbeen removed]\n\n\n",
