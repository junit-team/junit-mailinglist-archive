As part of their programming activity, XP developers<br/>\nwrite and maintain (white box) unit tests continually. These tests are<br/>\nautomated, written in the same programming language as the production<br/>\ncode,<br/>\nconsidered an explicit part of the code, and put under revision control. <br/>\nThe XP process encourages writing a test class for every class in the<br/>\nsystem. Methods in these test classes are used to verify complicated<br/>\nfunctionality and unusual circumstances. Moreover, they are used to<br/>\ndocument<br/>\ncode by explicitly indicating what the expected results of a method<br/>\nshould<br/>\nbe for typical cases. Last but not least, tests are added upon receiving<br/>\na<br/>\nbug report to check for the bug and to check the bug fix.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd there is more than unit testing: Acceptance tests (also known as<br/>\nfunctional tests in XP terms) are used to prove that the application<br/>\nworks<br/>\nas the customer wishes. They help the customers to gain confidence that<br/>\nthe<br/>\nwhole product is progressing in the right direction.  Acceptance tests<br/>\noperate from the customer perspective, they don&#39;t test every possible<br/>\npath<br/>\nin the code (unit tests take care of that), but demonstrate that the<br/>\nbusiness value is present. Furthermore, they allow the programmer to<br/>\ntrack<br/>\nthe state of implementation in relation to the user written story cards.<br/>\n<br/>\nOBJECTIVES<br/>\n<br/>\nThe purpose of this workshop is to bring together practitioners,<br/>\nresearchers, academics, and students to discuss the state-of-the-art of<br/>\ntesting in extreme software development projects. The goal is to share<br/>\nexperience, consolidate successful techniques, collect guidelines, and<br/>\nidentify open issues for future work.<br/>\n<br/>\nWorkshop topics include, but are not limited to: <br/>\n - Bad smells in testing          - Testing patterns <br/>\n - Refactoring test code          - Test first design <br/>\n - Automated acceptance testing   - Dealing with testing conflicts <br/>\n - Experience reports <br/>\n<br/>\nSUBMISSIONS<br/>\n<br/>\nParticipants are asked to submit a two page position paper detailing<br/>\ntheir<br/>\nperspective on one or more of the above topics. Detailed technical<br/>\ndescriptions of a special testing technique might be longer, if needed.<br/>\nPosition papers that focus on acceptance testing should include an<br/>\noverview of the attempted solution strategy, whether it was successful<br/>\nor<br/>\nnot, what level of automation was reached, how test results are<br/>\nreported,<br/>\nhow tests are implemented and maintained and who is specifying,<br/>\nimplementing<br/>\nand running the tests (customer, dedicated tester, developer, automated<br/>\nbuild).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe organizers will accept position statements based on originality,<br/>\nrelevance, and suitability for triggering discussion.  Please mail your<br/>\nsubmission (in PDF or PS) to Leon Moonen (Leon.Moonen@...).<br/>\n<br/>\nIMPORTANT DATES<br/>\n<br/>\nDeadline for submission of position papers:   April 22, 2002<br/>\nNotification of acceptance:                   May 3, 2002<br/>\nWorkshop date:                                May 27, 2002<br/>\n<br/>\nWORKSHOP FORMAT <br/>\n<br/>\nThe workshop will be lively and entertaining. It aims at discussion and<br/>\ninteraction rather than presentations. However, all participants will be<br/>\ngiven a chance to give a short presentation. These presentations will<br/>\nserve<br/>\nto introduce a case study, provoke discussion by presenting a<br/>\ncontroversial<br/>\npoint of view, or introduce new points of view. Live presentations of<br/>\ntesting techniques are also highly welcome (in addition to a position<br/>\npaper). This would open the possibility to take a look at the<br/>\nimplementation, if needed, and discuss the nuts & bolts in more detail.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe workshop opens with an introduction session where participants can<br/>\nraise<br/>\nthe questions they would like to get addressed in the workshop; in the<br/>\nconcluding wrap up we&#39;ll evaluate how far we got in answering these<br/>\nquestions.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll accepted position papers will be published on the workshop page<br/>\nprior to<br/>\nthe workshop and the participants will be asked to read the papers<br/>\nbefore<br/>\nthe workshop.<br/>\n<br/>\nWORKSHOP ORGANIZERS<br/>\n<br/>\nLeon Moonen<br/>\nCWI, the Netherlands<br/>\nLeon.Moonen@...<br/>\n<br/>\nMartin Lippert<br/>\nUniversity of Hamburg & Apcon WPS, Germany<br/>\nlippert@...<br/>\n<br/>\nPROGRAM COMMITTEE<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is a small program committee to review the position papers, <br/>\ngive feedback and support the workshop at XP2002<br/>\n<br/>\nArie van Deursen (CWI, the Netherlands)<br/>\nSteve Freeman (M3P, United Kingdom)<br/>\nTim Mackinnon (Connextra, United Kingdom)<br/>\nGerard Meszaros (ClearStream Consulting, Canada)<br/>\nJoseph Pelrine (MetaProg, Switzerland)<br/>\nStefan Roock (University of Hamburg & Apcon WPS, Germany)<br/>\nShaun Smith (ClearStream Consulting, Canada)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nReferences<br/>\n[1]  K.
