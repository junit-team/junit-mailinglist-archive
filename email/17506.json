Over the last 7 years I have<br/>\n&gt; come to the following conclusions:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 1. There are no instances in which TDD is impossible.<br/>\n&gt; 2. There are no instances in which TDD is not advantageous.<br/>\n&gt; 3. The impediments to TDD are human, not technical.<br/>\n&gt; 4. The alternative to TDD is code that is not repeatably testable.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Therefore I consider TDD to be a minimum professional standard.<br/>\n&gt; Developers who do not use TDD fall below that standard.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I can&#39;t quite agree with that, but I would be thrilled to wake up one <br/>\nmorning to find out that it&#39;s true. If that became /the/ minimum <br/>\nprofessional standard (whatever that would mean), I wouldn&#39;t complain.<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJ. B.
