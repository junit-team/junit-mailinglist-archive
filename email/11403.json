I&#39;m stuck with<br/>\n&gt;  &gt;   it.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve been thinking for a while that this is a serious problem in JUnit<br/>\n&gt; (and most unit testing frameworks), because it&#39;s been such an annoyance<br/>\n&gt; for so many people. Let&#39;s face it; a lot of groups of tests do have<br/>\n&gt; known dependencies between tests such that if test A fails, we know that<br/>\n&gt; the output of tests B, C and D are uninteresting. Yet we end up running<br/>\n&gt; B, C and D anyway, and then searching through all the error output for<br/>\n&gt; the failure that we know is the &quot;real&quot; one, ignoring all the others as<br/>\n&gt; spurious.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I would really like a way to be able to express this dependency<br/>\n&gt; information to the test framework, so that I can get back the<br/>\n&gt; interesting results with fewer uninteresting results. Can anybody<br/>\n&gt; think of a good way to do this?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>One thing you could try is this:<br/>\n<br/>\n1. Add an abort() method to interface Test that allows a test to be <br/>\naborted. For a test case, this simply fails the test with an &quot;aborted&quot; <br/>\nmessage. For test suites, this causes the suite to stop executing entirely.<br/>\n<br/>\n2. Express dependencies by building a special OrderedTestSuite class <br/>\nthat aborts when a test fails. All tests that depend on each other this <br/>\nway go into an OrderedTestSuite.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis may require a custom test runner, but that would be a good thing: <br/>\nit would mean less clutter in the base test runners.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for the details, I don&#39;t know, since I don&#39;t want it yet. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother possibility -- something that may be easier, for now -- is to <br/>\nfilter the test results based on your dependencies, since that seems to <br/>\nbe the underlying problem. I think that executing all those tests would <br/>\nbe interesting, in case doing so uncovers some strange, unexpected <br/>\ndependency that you /need/ to fix.<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJ. B.
