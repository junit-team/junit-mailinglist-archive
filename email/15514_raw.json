But as a compromise, I have agree to set up\n&gt; Maven and Cactus to automatically perform in-container unit tests on\n&gt; those thin-layer EJB&#39;s until I can prove to the fellow in charge that\n&gt; it hurts more than it helps (to unit test continuously, instead of\n&gt; integration test at the end).\n&gt; \n&gt; I suppose my question is... just how bad is this going to hurt? :) \n&gt; Will I really end up in a straightjacket?\n\nSince you&#39;re using the Sun container, I don&#39;t know how much tool support \nyou&#39;ll get out there. You&#39;ve already felt one hurdle.\n\nI&#39;ve never ended up in a straitjacket myself, but I&#39;ve heard stories. I \nwouldn&#39;t do it myself; but I&#39;d offer to let someone else do it.\n-- \nJ. B.
