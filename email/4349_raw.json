I believe the eXtreme\nProgramming methodology recommends this, but I am not\nfor sure.\n\n\n\n--- Vladimir Bossicard &lt;vladimir@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;&gt;Does anyone have experience using inner classes\n&gt; and\n&gt; &gt;&gt;JUnit in order to test private methods?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Sometimes a class has only one/two public methods,\n&gt; the internal \n&gt; &quot;business&quot; is split into several smaller (protected)\n&gt; methods (like \n&gt; algorithms).  If you test your public _and_\n&gt; protected methods, you&#39;re \n&gt; simply &quot;overtesting&quot; your class (writing more tests\n&gt; than strictly \n&gt; necessary).  It&#39;s up to you to decide if you need\n&gt; these tests.\n&gt; \n&gt; I like the idea of letting the user decide if he/she\n&gt; wants to test the \n&gt; protected methods or not.  Sometimes it&#39;s useful,\n&gt; sometimes it&#39;s not, \n&gt; but as I don&#39;t know anything about your classes, I\n&gt; prefer not to impose \n&gt; such rules.\n&gt; \n&gt;  &gt; If your public methods work, doesn&#39;t that imply\n&gt; that the \n&gt; private/protected\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; methods also work?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; It depends how well these tests cover you class&#39;s\n&gt; code.  Your test \n&gt; methods may not cover 100% of the code and your\n&gt; class will still work \n&gt; fine.  If anther class extends this class and calls\n&gt; your \n&gt; private/protected methods with other arguments (and\n&gt; exercise code you \n&gt; haven&#39;t tested), your class _may_ not work properly\n&gt; anymore.\n&gt; \n&gt; You can find arguments for not testing public\n&gt; methods and for testing \n&gt; them.  The goal is to find bugs as early as possible\n&gt; (and not to write \n&gt; tests).  If you&#39;re confident that you write clean\n&gt; code by only testing \n&gt; the public methods, fine.  Other developers prefer\n&gt; to test public and \n&gt; protected methods.\n&gt; \n&gt; It&#39;s a matter of confidence\n&gt; \n&gt; -Vladimir\n&gt; \n&gt; -- \n&gt; Vladimir Bossicard\n&gt; www.bossicard.com\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n=====\nBest Regards,\nCornellious Mann\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
