The set up can get complicated to \nmake\n&gt; sure the system state is correct to start the test, and/or the tear \ndown\n&gt; can get complex to make sure we leave the system in a good state.  \nI&#39;ve\n&gt; seen suggestions to use mock objects that behave as if the system \nstate\n&gt; is correct to get around some of this.  Comments?]\n\nYes, tests that occur in the middle of a use case are tedious to \nsetup and brittle during refactorings.\nSometimes they are useful for debugging a certain situation, but may \nnot be worth their weight to carry forward.\n\nWith regards to testing use cases, consider writing a \nsimple &quot;structured-english&quot; scripting language to express your tests. \nThe benefit of this approach is that these tests can be understood \nand written by the business analysts and thus reduce the cost of \ndevelopment and errors when translating them to Java.\n\nhere is a simple script:\n\n[TestPurchaseOrder.esl]\n\n%include loadCustomers.esl\n%include loadProducts.esl\n%include loadEmployees.esl\n\ncreate PurchaseOrder P1\n   date = TODAY\n   customer = [ Customer with id = 101 ]\n   salesperson = [ Salesperson with name = &quot;John Honest&quot; ]\n   addItem [ Part with partNumber = &quot;103QAS23&quot;\n                price = $50.00\n                qty = 100 ]\n   addItem [ Part with partNumber = &quot;103WQ3&quot; \n               price = $40.00\n                qty = 10 ]\n\nassert P1\n   date = TODAY\n   totalCost = $5400.00\n   totalWeight &lt; 1000lb\n\nassert P1\n   hasItem Part with partNumber = &quot;103QAS23&quot;\n\n&gt; A question for the list:  How do you organize your tests, \nparticularly\n&gt; if you write tests that are of both the functional scenario and \nsingle\n&gt; object unit test varieties?  The common approach seems to be to \ngather\n&gt; all the tests for a given class in one test class.  What about the\n&gt; scenario type of tests?  Organized by use case?  What communicates\n&gt; better, especially if we want to use the tests as documentation?\n&gt; \n\nUsually I organize functional tests by subsystem/useCase.\n\nRegards,\n\nDavid\n\n\n\n",
