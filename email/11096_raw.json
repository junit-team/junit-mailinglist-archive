One of the concerns that I (and\n&gt;&gt;developers) have is that we will end up with thousands of test cases, many\n&gt;&gt;of which will involve using substantial amounts of MockObjects to set up\n&gt;&gt;test cases and that all this will become too much of an overhead to manage  \n&gt;&gt;maintain. Specifically,� that changing code in the future will involve\n&gt;&gt;analysis of not only the project code but also the junit test code - an\n&gt;&gt;overhead we don&#39;t have today of course.\n\nYes, don&#39;t look at the tests as overhead.  Look at them as short-cuts\nthat help you understand.  For instance, often it is great to know\nthat:\n\nassertEquals(0, floogle.flumox(12))\nand assertEquals(1, floogle.flumox(13))\n\nwithout calculating it out by hand.\n\nThe other reason why they help is because they act as a &quot;software\nvise.&quot;  They hold down the behavior of your system and let you know\nwhen you are changing more behavior than you expected to.  That alone\nis invaluable in development.\n\nTests make maintenance easier because they hack away at uncertainty.\n\nMichael Feathers\nwww.objectmentor.com\n\n\n",
