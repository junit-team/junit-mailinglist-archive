At first, I had multiple versions\nof the same fixture lying around my T=\r\nestCases. As I found myself\nwriting more identical fixtures, I began to thi=\r\nnk about finding a\ncentral place for these (in order to keep my code DRY an=\r\nd avoid a\nmaintenance nightmare further down the road). \n\nUsing inheritance=\r\n and placing the common fixtures in a super class\nseemed to be the right wa=\r\ny to go. In fact, it worked quite well as\nlong as my classes only implement=\r\ned one interface. However, as soon as\nI stumbled upon a class implementing =\r\ntwo of these interfaces, I was\nfaced with a choice of which super TestCase =\r\nto extend=85\n\nI realize that maybe this isn&#39;t the right way to go but I&#39;d l=\r\nike to be\nsure before I throw it all away and try another path=85\n\nI&#39;ll pos=\r\nt the results of my &quot;quest&quot; if I ever find an interesting\nsolution.\n\nYours,=\r\n\n\nDimitri\n\n--- In junit@yahoogroups.com, David Saff &lt;saff@m...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; D,=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; It&#39;s an interesting problem.  Have you tried going at it\nincrementall=\r\ny?  \n&gt; Go ahead and write the unit tests for two or three of your classes, =\r\n\n&gt; cutting and pasting if necessary.  Then go back and see what you\nhave to=\r\n \n&gt; do to remove the duplication.  I often find this to be an effective way=\r\n \n&gt; to make an abstract question concrete.\n&gt; \n&gt; If, in the midst of doing t=\r\nhis exercise, you find yourself with a\nsmall, \n&gt; focused example of a place=\r\n where you would be tempted to use multiple \n&gt; inheritance, please post it.=\r\n  I&#39;m willing to bet, with even odds, that \n&gt; you&#39;ll quickly find other way=\r\ns of gracefully doing what you need.  Good \n&gt; luck,\n&gt; \n&gt;     David Saff\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; Java Questions wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Hi everyone,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m faced with a &quot;desig=\r\nn problem&quot; and I was hoping that some\n&gt; &gt; experienced developer could help =\r\nme figure out how to sort it out.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I use a lot of small interfaces i=\r\nn my application, each of which has a\n&gt; &gt; very precise purpose. Most of my =\r\n&quot;concrete&quot; classes implement more\n&gt; &gt; than one of these interfaces.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n Now, I was hoping to find a way to refactor my tests so that each\n&gt; &gt; inte=\r\nrface has its own abstract TestCase. Then, if multiple inheritance\n&gt; &gt; was =\r\nallowed in Java, I could simply implement each classes concrete\n&gt; &gt; classe&#39;=\r\ns TestCase by inheriting from all the appropriate &quot;interface\n&gt; &gt; TestCases&quot;=\r\n.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; This would allow me to inherit all the general purpose fixtures a=\r\nnd\n&gt; &gt; simply add some new fixtures targeted for the concrete classe&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nspecific behavior. In a way, I simply want to enforce the &quot;Liskov\n&gt; &gt; Subst=\r\nitution Principle&quot; as simply as possible...\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I know multiple inherit=\r\nance isn&#39;t allowed in Java and should be\n&gt; &gt; avoided anyway but I&#39;d like to=\r\n find a simple way to keep the general\n&gt; &gt; idea of &quot;interface specific supe=\r\nr TestCases&quot; and apply it to classes\n&gt; &gt; implementing several of these inte=\r\nrfaces.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Is the general idea a good one ? If it is, what is  the bes=\r\nt way to \n&gt; &gt; achieve it ?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Thanks in advance,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; D.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n-----------------------------------------------------------------=\r\n-------\n&gt; &gt; YAHOO!
