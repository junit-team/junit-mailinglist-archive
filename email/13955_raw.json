Perhaps someone can let me know if the\nfollowing code seems OK?\n\n/**\n* Runs all tests in ArticleNounTest once, and then runs the\n* random test several times.\n*/\npublic static Test suite() {\n  TestSuite suite = new TestSuite(ArticleNounTest.class);\n  suite.addTest(new RepeatedTest(new ArticleNounTest(&quot;testRandom&quot;), 20));\n  return suite;\n}\n\nUsing RepeatedTest replaces the following lines of code:\n    //for (int i=0; i&lt;20; i++)\n    //  suite.addTest(new ArticleNounTest(&quot;testRandom&quot;));\nIs there any other advantage to using RepeatedTest instead of the\nabove &quot;for&quot; loop?  Perhaps RepeatedTest reports its findings in a\nnicer way than the &quot;for&quot; loop would?  The JavaDoc for RepeatedTest\nonly states that it is &quot;A Decorator that runs a test repeatedly.&quot;\n\nAs to what I am testing and why use randomness:\nI&#39;m testing a little program for learning Italian;  the program\nrandomly generates short phrases in English and then the student\nsupplies the corresponding Italian...  so I want to have the tests\ndo their random generation of several different phrases.\n(I&#39;m not testing how random the behavior is, I just want to\nthrow a bunch of random possibilities at my code to get the\ncode to break).\n\nRegards,\n--ErikN\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: junit@yahoogroups.com [mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com] On Behalf Of\nSimon Chappell\nSent: Friday, June 17, 2005 6:13 AM\nTo: junit@yahoogroups.com\nSubject: Re: [junit] random testing with JUnit\n\n\nTesting random behaviour is very difficult. After all how will you know it\nwhen you see it? If you get exactly the randomness that you were looking\nfor, wouldn&#39;t that mean that there was a problem with your randomness?\n\nOn 6/16/05, eriknusanet &lt;erikn@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Hi, I&#39;m new to JUnit.  I&#39;m wondering what is the right way to set up \n&gt; some random tests?\n&gt; \n&gt; Should I just put into my tests a loop runs the test multiple times? \n&gt; This seems to imply that the test needs to call setUp() to get some \n&gt; fresh objects (&quot;test fixture&quot;) each time through the loop, which seems \n&gt; somehow wrong (at least I&#39;ve seen no examples like this).  Is there \n&gt; some better way to ask for a test to be run N times?\n&gt; \n&gt; I got turned on to JUnit from the book\n&gt;   Building Parsers with JavaT by Steven John Metsker\n&gt; however it seems that he does not use JUnit for random tests.  He has \n&gt; a section extolling JUnit, but then a section immediately after about \n&gt; random testing that doesn&#39;t use JUnit at all.\n&gt; \n&gt; Perhaps random testing is not considered part of unit testing?  If so, \n&gt; why?\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks for the help.\n&gt; --Erik N\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Yahoo!
