I would prefer that these operations run once. (example \nsharing a connection for all the tests). \n\nI am currently using static initializers (and some lazy initializing) \ninstead of TestSetUp.\nThere are two reasons for this. \n\n- one reason is that I have some setup code that needs to run for all \ntests, this happens in the static initializer of a base TestCase \nclass. The static initializers of the subclasses run setup code for \nthe suite. \n\n- the other reason is that I want to be able to run individual \nTestCases as well as the suites and suites of suites.\n\nThe problem is that now I need tearDown functionality .. so am \nlooking at TestSetUp again. - but don&#39;t want to sacrifice the ability \nto run an individual test case (particularly for testing my test \ncode).\n\n- any suggestions? \n\nI realize that the tests should be independent. and they are as much \nas possible. but I am also trying to be practical, I am testing ejbs \nand database operations.\n\nmaybe I should be looking at Cactus? or other .. but need a solution \nin the meantime.\n\n--\nJennifer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
