I generally \n&gt; don&#39;t put \n&gt; JavaDoc tags in my test classes, so any generated JavaDoc \n&gt; would simply \n&gt; show the class and method names.  You get that same information when \n&gt; you run the tests.\n\nSorry - probably I wasn&#39;t clear enough: I was not (only) talking about\nTestCase classes, but *all* the classes making up a test suite. Most\nlibraries of today are extendible - in fact, they often provide only\ninterfaces without implementations. As an (not really good, but easily\navailable) example, take JDK&#39;s Runnable interface. Obviously, you would\nhave written a test with a concrete class implementing Runnable - at\nleast to test the Thread(Runnable) and Thread(Runnable, String), but\nalso SwingUtilities.invokeLater(Runnable) and others. These concrete\nclasses are therefore part of your test suite. My question somewhat\nrephrased:\nWhen this last happened to you,\n\na)/b) did you javadoc these classes - which might be interesting for the\nAPI user as useful small examples? - \na) in the Javadoc of the library (where they clutter up the &quot;real API&quot;,\nbut are readily available)\nb) in a separate Javadoc?\n\nc) Or do you deliver the examples as code only and point the users to\nsome test/examples directory, without giving them Javadoc for those\nclasses?\n\nRegards\nHarald M.
