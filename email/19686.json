It didn&#39;t take long to get to the organizational dysfunction in play.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Hard to say it is dysfunction. In term of income, it is definitely<br/>\nfunctional, this is a company earn a lot and probably everyone know<br/>\nthe name.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  Not necessarily: the more modularized the system, the less complex the<br/>\n&gt;  configuration would be. I&#39;m willing to bit there&#39;s at least one piece of<br/>\n&gt;  configuration information you have to specify in XML that either never<br/>\n&gt;  changes or you&#39;d never want to change, but you have to put it there<br/>\n&gt;  because something else in the same class needs to be configurable.<br/>\n&gt;  That&#39;s a sign of the layering problem I have in mind.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>There are 2 examples I come to my mind immediately.<br/>\n1) We have a factory that hold the reference of all repositories in a<br/>\nmap. That map is configurable with difference implementation:<br/>\n<br/>\n\t&lt;bean id=&quot;concurrentHashMap&quot;<br/>\n\t\tclass=&quot;java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentHashMap&quot; singleton=&quot;false&quot; /&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n2) All data access object ( map DB column names to getter and setter<br/>\nonly, no single logic, i.e.<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://martinfowler.com/bliki/AnemicDomainModel.html\">http://martinfowler.com/bliki/AnemicDomainModel.html</a> ) , have<br/>\ninterfaces and inject by spring.<br/>\n<br/>\nI cannot think of any other implmentation for the above 2 cases,<br/>\nprobably better layering will help, but above is definitely<br/>\nover-engineering in my point of view.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  Aha! Another organizational dysfunction. They&#39;re everywhere! :)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Well.... we have to follow the policy :-/<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  I would want to learn more about the two organizational problems you<br/>\n&gt;  described to me first. Why are you being ordered to do something that<br/>\n&gt;  you strongly believe is a bad idea? Why does your team have to create<br/>\n&gt;  holes in the design to get around testing? What you describe is a<br/>\n&gt;  classic case of trying to solve people problems by changing code. It<br/>\n&gt;  doesn&#39;t work for long. :)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  I sympathize with your position. It&#39;s not easy.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Actually may be my tone is too strong, people are nice and the order<br/>\nis just a stronger tone of recommendation from my supervior. I just<br/>\njoin this company and now I start to build up some creditability and<br/>\nprobably I can affect some design decision later.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  I don&#39;t know whether it&#39;s so off-topic: introducing JUnit into an<br/>\n&gt;  organization tends to get people asking more interesting questions. I<br/>\n&gt;  see it over and over again.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Actually there are some junit tests that created before but now most<br/>\nof the are commented out like<br/>\n<br/>\npublic void testXXX() {<br/>\n/**<br/>\n....<br/>\n....<br/>\n*/<br/>\n}<br/>\n<br/>\nBecause they are already not compilable and no one bother to fix it.<br/>\nIt is a long way to persuade developer to write and maintain<br/>\nunit-test. :-/<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  Back to your comment, of course it&#39;s the case: DI containers are no more<br/>\n&gt;  magic than any other code. It&#39;s also false, though, that DI containers<br/>\n&gt;  force you to have 100 XML configuration files. I just wanted to be sure<br/>\n&gt;  both sides were represented in the discussion.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  Good luck... I mean that.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yes, I need luck ;-)</div>",
