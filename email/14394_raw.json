Maybe I&#39;m\n&gt; just being sentimental here but the Graphical TestRunner&#39;s green\n&gt; bar/red\n&gt; bar was one of the earliest delights of Junit.\n&gt; \n&gt; Besides, as a casual user of Java I have yet to find the energy to\n&gt; learn\n&gt; an IDE.  When I do have to code Java I generally use my normal text\n&gt; editor and the graphical test runner, which I find is quicker and\n&gt; easier\n&gt; to use than the text version.\n&gt; \n&gt; I know Kent has an evangelising streak - automated unit testing,\n&gt; xp/agile, etc - which he has used well in the service of the software\n&gt; community but I think insisting on the use of an IDE is a crusade too\n&gt; far.\n\nI was disappointed by this news as well.  I do use an IDE for most of\nthe day, but when I have to work remotely I use &#39;vi&#39; over SSH and a GUI\nTestRunner on my local machine.  So personally, I would like to have at\nleast one graphical TestRunner. (Yes, I know that I could set up many\nIDEs to do the same thing -- Eclipse for instance -- but that chews up\ntoo many resources on my laptop.)\n\nKent, perhaps you would consider adding a community section to CVS and\nallow us to add code there.  You can document this portion of the\nrepository as being &quot;unwarranted&quot; (whatever that would mean).  It would\nallow for the community to add their $0.02.  I don&#39;t think anyone wants\nto make more work for you or Erich, but it would be nice to have an easy\nway for everyone to use JUnit in a way that is comfortable to them.\n\n-- \nJason Rogers\n\nI am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ\nliveth in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the\nfaith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me.\n(Galatians 2:20)\n\n\n",
