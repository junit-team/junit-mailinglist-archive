I could use\nsome advice.\n\nSome background: I&#39;ve come into a project that has no\ntest coverage and has some pretty aggregious code...\nmeanwhile new features are being slowly added.  The\nthing feels like it&#39;s on the verge of imploding, and\nthis is the calm before the storm.\n\nI&#39;m going through the process right now of adding test\ncases, but as I write them I&#39;m constantly fighting the\nurge to fix stuff.  My question: is it better to write\nall the tests first, then go back to fixing what&#39;s\nbroken, or to fix the bugs and &quot;smelly&quot; code as you go?\n\n\n\t\t\n__________________________________ \nDiscover Yahoo! \nUse Yahoo! to plan a weekend, have fun online and more.
