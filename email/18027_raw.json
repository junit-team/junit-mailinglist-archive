The user\nwill select two data sources and do a &quot;compare&quot; of specific data between\nthe two sources.  The he can elect to do a &quot;copy&quot; of data from one data\nsource to another.\n\nI&#39;m doing the copy part, and that&#39;s done now (I know...I coded first). \nThe compare part is just beginning, being done by someone else.\n\nIn the end, I want to be able to run an end-to-end test, where we set\nthings up, run the compare, and then run the copy.  But until then, I\nneed to be able to fake out the compare and just my part - the copy\noperation.\n\nAs I understand it, all test* methods in the class will be run in\nwhatever order they appear in the file.  What I&#39;d really like to do is\nhave a testCompare and a testCopy, but I don&#39;t think I can do that and\nget what I want.\n\nI thought about having something like:\n\nclass TestOne extends TestCase {\n    public static boolean testCompare = false;\n\n    testStuff() {\n       if (testCompare)\n          doTestCompare();\n       else\n          doFakeOutCompare();\n       doTestCopy();\n    }\n\n    doTestCompare() {\n       // really do a compare test\n    }\n\n    doFakeOutCompare() {\n       // Put stuff in the data source to make\n    }\n\n    doTestCopy() {\n       // Do the copy test\n    }\n}\n\nSo, I&#39;d really have only one test method that would get called, and he\nwould pick whether to do the real compare or fake it out.  Later on,\nwhen compare is ready to be integrated, then we&#39;d flip that testCompare\nswitch to true, and then we would have an end-to-end test.  How would\nthat do?\n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\n\n\n",
