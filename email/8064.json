In fact, I do some tests on my<br/>\n&gt; &gt; equals functions by taking 2 objects that should be equal, and also<br/>\n&gt; &gt; comparing 2 objects that are not. I also verify that they are not<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the same objects (i.e. obj1 == obj2)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; [Dave responded with:]<br/>\n&gt; Have a look at the Gargoyle extensions that Mike Bowler has written:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; http://gsbase.sourceforge.net/<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Part of it is EqualsTester which does a comprehensive verification of<br/>\n&gt; a class&#39;s equals() and hashCode() methods.  It saves alot of test code.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>That&#39;s excellent. Downloading now. Thanks<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; In fact, I just got hired by this company and they don&#39;t do ANY<br/>\n&gt; &gt; testing... I&#39;m trying to move them forward in this, so I appreciate<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the tips.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Are they interested in improving that?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &lt;This message contains commercial content, reader disgression is advised&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Also, watch for my book in July: http://www.adaptionsoft.com/tddapg.htm<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &lt;/commercial content&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve just pre-ordered your book on BN. Looking forward to reading it. I&#39;m<br/>\ncurrently delving into several XP books (Java Tools for Extreme Programming,<br/>\nas well as the Oreilly XP Cookbook)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; I&#39;ll look into Mocks. I&#39;ve read a little about them, but I&#39;m trying<br/>\n&gt; &gt; to take baby steps...<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; They can take a bit of effort to grok... but they are a very powerful<br/>\n&gt; testing tool.  I suggest EasyMock (www.easymock.org) as well as<br/>\n&gt; MockObjects (http://www.mockobjects.com)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Thanks for the links. Got them bookmarked.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; My main concern is that the functionality involved serializing to a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; file, so I thought I&#39;d need to exercise that in a test (i.e., saving<br/>\n&gt; &gt; to a known location, then making sure it loads from the same known<br/>\n&gt; &gt; location, etc).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 1) I&#39;d consider that more of an integration level test (which needs to<br/>\n&gt; be done, but not as part of TDD)<br/>\n&gt; 2) when TDDing you should try to avoid using external resources as<br/>\n&gt; much as possible<br/>\n&gt; 3) use createTempFile.. see<br/>\n&gt; http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.1/docs/api/java/io/File.html#createTempFile(j<br/>\n&gt; ava.lang.String,%20java.lang.String)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Got a lot to learn about TDDing. Sucks trying to learn this while attempting<br/>\ndevelop software with a deadline...<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for the tips, and I&#39;m sure this list will be hearing from me again.</div>",
