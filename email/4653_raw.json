If you&#39;re mentioning the &quot;excluded.properties&quot; problem, I \nbet you use the SwingRunner and this runner is well know to have several \nproblems with the loading of classes.  So first try to execute your \ntests with the TextRunner.\n\nI haven&#39;t had a look at the eclipse junit runner but it may be based on \nthe TextRunner and not the SwingRunner.  If anyone can clarify this \npoint, I&#39;d be thankfull (giving the cvs entry where I can have a look at \nthe implementation would be even better).\n\n-Vladimir\n\n-- \nVladimir Bossicard\nwww.bossicard.com\n\n\n",
