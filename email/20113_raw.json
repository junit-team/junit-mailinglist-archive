The second section, &quot;Changing Software&quot;, is\n&gt; almost a set of case studies. Each chapter addresses a specific problem of\n&gt; the\n&gt; form, &#39;I need to ...&quot; or &quot;How do I ...&quot; with clear suggestions and\n&gt; illustrations.\n&gt; The third section, &quot; Dependency-Breaking Techniques&quot;, returns to the\n&gt; general\n&gt; level and presents a catalog of tactics for breaking code down into\n&gt; testable\n&gt; (and manageable) segments.\n&gt;\n&gt; I sincerely believe the best thing you could do (given your questions) is\n&gt; to\n&gt; read that book and start trying out the techniques it presents.\n&gt;\n&gt; Good luck!\n&gt;\n&gt; -jn-\n&gt;\n&gt; On Nov 19, 2007 3:47 AM, Vladimir Chladny &lt;vladeycolder@...&lt;vladeycolder%40yahoo.com&gt;&gt;\n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Hello,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; could you suggest me some good article /resource/ about the strategy how\n&gt; to\n&gt; &gt; add jUnit testing to a large existing JAVA project, please?\n&gt; &gt; What is the best practice for this + some experience /e.g. typical\n&gt; problems\n&gt; &gt; to avoid.../?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; /I didn&#39;t find any usefull document on the internet for this topic yet./\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Thank you in advance,\n&gt; &gt; Vladey.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; __________________________________________________________\n&gt; &gt; Be a better pen pal.\n&gt; &gt; Text or chat with friends inside Yahoo!
