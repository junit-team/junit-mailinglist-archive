The theme of TAIC PART is<br/>\n   &quot;transferring software testing technology from academia to<br/>\n   industry.&quot;  TAIC PART aims to forge collaborations between industry<br/>\n   and academia.  The goals of TAIC PART 2008 include the articulation<br/>\n   of fundamental research questions in the field of software testing<br/>\n   and analysis.  TAIC PART also focuses on the practical challenges<br/>\n   that are often faced by software developers in industry.<br/>\n<br/>\n-----------------<br/>\n  Call for Papers<br/>\n-----------------<br/>\n<br/>\n   TAIC PART 2008 solicits experience, tool, original research,<br/>\n   industry challenge, and academic challenge papers that explore<br/>\n   software testing and analysis techniques.  Research topics include,<br/>\n   but are not limited to, the following areas:<br/>\n    <br/>\n     Test Adequacy Criteria<br/>\n     Test Suite Execution<br/>\n     Test Coverage Monitoring<br/>\n     Automated Test Data Generation<br/>\n     Regression Testing<br/>\n     Automated Debugging and Fault Localization<br/>\n     Performance Evaluation<br/>\n     Static and Dynamic Analysis<br/>\n     Verification and Validation<br/>\n     Software Reliability Engineering<br/>\n     Model-Based Testing<br/>\n     Testing and Formal Methods<br/>\n     Testing and Model Checking<br/>\n     Software Testing Process<br/>\n     Technology Transfer<br/>\n<br/>\n   TAIC PART solicits papers that focus on the testing and analysis of<br/>\n   software applications that include, but are not limited to, the<br/>\n   following types:<br/>\n<br/>\n     Embedded and Real-Time Systems<br/>\n     Operating Systems <br/>\n     Parallel, Distributed, and Cluster Applications<br/>\n     Service-Oriented Software Systems<br/>\n     Web Applications<br/>\n     Event-Based Systems<br/>\n     File and Storage Systems<br/>\n     Virtual Machine-Based Applications<br/>\n     Database Applications<br/>\n     XML Processing Systems<br/>\n     Graphical User Interfaces<br/>\n     Wireless Sensor Networks<br/>\n     Safety Critical Systems<br/>\n     AI and Machine Learning Systems<br/>\n     Business Applications<br/>\n<br/>\n-----------------<br/>\n  Types of Papers<br/>\n-----------------<br/>\n<br/>\n    - Experience reports should provide practical and generalizable<br/>\n      insights into how to apply and extend existing approaches to<br/>\n      software testing and analysis. <br/>\n<br/>\n    - Tool papers must focus on the design, implementation, and<br/>\n      evaluation of software testing and analysis tools. <br/>\n<br/>\n    - Original Research papers will explore novel software testing<br/>\n      techniques.  These papers should furnish a detailed theoretical<br/>\n      and/or empirical evaluation of the proposed approach.<br/>\n<br/>\n    - Industry Challenge papers must have at least one author whose<br/>\n      affiliation in non-academic.  These papers will describe a<br/>\n      real-world software testing problem for which help is sought<br/>\n      from the academic research community. <br/>\n<br/>\n    - Academic Challenge papers must have at least one author<br/>\n      whose affiliation in non-industry.  These papers should explain<br/>\n      a software testing research problem for which help is sought<br/>\n      from industry partners. <br/>\n<br/>\n------------------<br/>\n  Paper Evaluation<br/>\n------------------<br/>\n<br/>\n    All papers will undergo a rigorous examination by at least<br/>\n    three members of the program committee. The Program Co-Chairs and<br/>\n    the Program Committee will provide thoughtful and fair reviews<br/>\n    that furnish detailed insights into ways for improving and<br/>\n    extending the papers.  All submitted papers will be<br/>\n    evaluated according to (i) relevance to the conference themes and<br/>\n    goals and (ii) clarity and organization. <br/>\n<br/>\n    - Experience reports will be evaluated with respect to the<br/>\n      significance and generality of the described testing experience.<br/>\n<br/>\n    - Research and tool papers will be judged by the technical merit,<br/>\n      novelty, and evaluation of the described technique or tool.<br/>\n<br/>\n    - Industry and academic challenge papers will be assessed<br/>\n      according to their ability to forge partnerships and ultimately<br/>\n      yield successful solutions.<br/>\n<br/>\n    The results described in the submitted paper must be unpublished<br/>\n    and should not be under review at other workshops, conferences, or<br/>\n    journals.<br/>\n <br/>\n------------------<br/>\n  Paper Formatting<br/>\n------------------<br/>\n<br/>\n    Papers should be formatted using the IEEE conference style<br/>\n    format. Including all references and figures, a research paper<br/>\n    must not exceed the ten page limit and the experience, tool, and<br/>\n    industry and academic challenge papers should not be longer than<br/>\n    five pages.  Papers should have an abstract that is no longer than<br/>\n    150 words. Please be aware that if your paper is accepted, the<br/>\n    abstract may appear in the advance program and on the TAIC PART<br/>\n    2008 Web site. Authors should submit a PDF version of their paper<br/>\n    using the conference submission system.  More details about paper<br/>\n    submission will be posted to the TAIC PART Web site in the near<br/>\n    future.<br/>\n<br/>\n----------------------<br/>\n  Workshop Proceedings<br/>\n----------------------<br/>\n<br/>\n    The accepted papers will be published with ISBN by the IEEE<br/>\n    Computer Society and they will appear in the IEEE digital library.<br/>\n    The presentations for all of the accepted papers will also be<br/>\n    provided for download on the TAIC PART 2008 Web site.  The<br/>\n    Conference Chair and Program Co-Chairs intend to arrange a journal<br/>\n    special issue that contains extended and revised versions of<br/>\n    selected papers from TAIC PART 2008.<br/>\n<br/>\n-----------------<br/>\n  Important Dates<br/>\n-----------------<br/>\n<br/>\n          May 2, 2008 :     Abstract Submission<br/>\n          May 9, 2008 :     Paper Submission<br/>\n         June 6, 2008 :     Author Notification<br/>\n        June 21, 2008 :     Camera-Ready Copy<br/>\n   August 29-31, 2008 :     TAIC PART 2008<br/>\n<br/>\n-------------------------<br/>\n  Conference Organization<br/>\n-------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\n    Conference Chair:<br/>\n      Marc Roper, University of Strathclyde<br/>\n\t\t\t\t  <br/>\n    Program Co-Chairs:<br/>\n      Leonardo Botacci, University of Hull \t<br/>\n      Gregory M.
