I\nwish my developers would provide such documentation...\nI&#39;m a system tester who is looking to do Component Testing, since we are headed\nto EJB.\nWe&#39;ve looked at and got running jtest and Jython (formerly known as JPython)\nand now are looking at JUnit to complete our tool package. I&#39;m working my way\nthru the JUnit documentation and hope to apply it to our app before the end of\nthe year, at least as a &#39;proof of concept&#39;.\nHappy New Year,\nPat\n\nsachin gupta wrote:\n\n&gt; Hello,\n&gt;\n&gt; There are no executable files (if that is what u meant). All these test\n&gt; runners are Java based classes that u can run simply by executing the\n&gt; respective classes i.e. junit.swingui.TestRunner etc.. You only need to\n&gt; include one jar file i.e. junit.jar in your classpath and maybe on you DOS\n&gt; prompt window you say\n&gt; &quot; java junit.swingui.TestRunner &quot; and you should see a UI. If you are\n&gt; looking for the code that is also available in respective directories.\n&gt; I think that this is among the best pieces of well documented and presented\n&gt; and useful code.\n&gt;\n&gt; Cheers,\n&gt;\n&gt; Sachin\n&gt;\n&gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; From: lynchnco@...

I&#39;m looking for tools to test java and ejb. So far,\n&gt; I&#39;ve evaluated jtest and Jython.\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;m now looking at JUnit...I&#39;ve downloaded and installed JUnit3.4 and\n&gt; ran the installation tests...everything went ok...\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;m curious as to where the batch, graphical and Swing based\n&gt; graphical executables, namely, junit.testui.TestRunner,\n&gt; junit.ui.TestRunner and\n&gt; junit.swingui.TestRunner are.\n&gt;\n&gt; I searched the installed JUnit3.4 folder the various jar files but I\n&gt; can&#39;t find these executables...not a problem but it&#39;s driving me nuts\n&gt; that I can&#39;t find them.\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;d appreciate any help.\n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt; Pat\n&gt;\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; junit-unsubscribe@egroups.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; junit-unsubscribe@egroups.com\n\n\n",
