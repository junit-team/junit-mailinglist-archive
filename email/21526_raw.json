One of the very few fea=\r\ntures we are missing is generating a class from the test class (but this fe=\r\nature is coming and you can join the NetBeans community and vote for this i=\r\nssue and other issues related to JUnit).\nTo follow Kent&#39;s approach what you=\r\n need to do is first create the Dollar class in the src folder as an empty =\r\nclass, and then create the test class in the test folder.\nNow type the whol=\r\ne test. NetBeans will underline in red the lines that have a problem. Go to=\r\n that line and press Alt+Enter, and NetBeans will present you the option to=\r\n create the missing part in the source class. Once you can compile the test=\r\n with no errors you can run it and make it fail. Then you can put your effo=\r\nrt in filling the source class with the logic to make the test pass.\nI hope=\r\n this is what you were looking for.\nAll the best,\n\nMarcelo.\n \n\n--- In junit=\r\n@yahoogroups.com, Nat Pryce &lt;nat.pryce@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;ve not found the J=\r\nUnit &quot;support&quot; in any IDE useful for TDD.  They\n&gt; all assume that you are t=\r\nesting a class that already exists, and if it\n&gt; does, they generate one tes=\r\nt per method of that class, which produces\n&gt; unhelpful test classes with un=\r\nhelpfully named tests.\n&gt; \n&gt; --Nat\n&gt; \n&gt; 2009/4/19 Karl Krasnowsky &lt;karlkras@=\r\n...&gt;:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; This question is really targeted to those who have used K=\r\nent Beck&#39;s book,\n&gt; &gt; Test-Driven Development within the context of the NetB=\r\neans IDE, otherwise\n&gt; &gt; please disregard.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Maybe someone here can pr=\r\novide a pointer to already available information on\n&gt; &gt; this.\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m using=\r\n Kent Beck&#39;s book, Test-Driven Development as a tutorial and was\n&gt; &gt; lookin=\r\ng at how i might use NetBeans with its JUnit plugin to mimic his\n&gt; &gt; recomm=\r\nended processes, but right out of the gate I&#39;m having a fundamental\n&gt; &gt; iss=\r\nue.\n&gt; &gt; A standard practice of KB&#39;s method is to code the test before any c=\r\node is\n&gt; &gt; written, and then backfill the empty bits (class, methods, varia=\r\nbles, etc.)\n&gt; &gt; to make the test work.\n&gt; &gt; for example, here&#39;s the first JU=\r\nnit test he shows in chapter 1 to begin\n&gt; &gt; building from:\n&gt; &gt; Code:\n&gt; &gt; pu=\r\nblic void testMultiplication() {\n&gt; &gt; Dollar five =3D new Dollar(5);\n&gt; &gt; fiv=\r\ne.times(2);\n&gt; &gt; assertEquals(10, five.amount);\n&gt; &gt; }\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Problem I&#39;m ha=\r\nving is, if I&#39;m creating tests out of the context of the Java\n&gt; &gt; project, =\r\ntests in NB aren&#39;t created until you have a class with runtime\n&gt; &gt; methods =\r\nto create tests from. So I have a chicken egg sort of situation. NB\n&gt; &gt; wou=\r\nld do the obvious thing, i.e., have tests generated from code, so the\n&gt; &gt; a=\r\nbove doesn&#39;t make any sense as it implies that the code is generated from\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; the test, which is a cool idea of the IDE could support it.\n&gt; &gt; I have e=\r\nxperience using JUnit, so the framework itself isn&#39;t in question,\n&gt; &gt; but h=\r\now to apply this methodology within the IDE format is.\n&gt; &gt; Do I have to sim=\r\nply short-circuit the default process that NB and the JUnit\n&gt; &gt; plugin manu=\r\nfacture?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; thanks in advance for any help on this,\n&gt; &gt; Karl\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; \n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; -- \n&gt; http://www.natpryce.com\n&gt;\n\n\n\n",
