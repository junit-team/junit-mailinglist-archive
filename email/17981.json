Working on <br/>\nsuch a thing on your own, if you get time and permission, can teach you <br/>\na lot about how Eclipse is built).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe developer tests should be vanilla JUnit tests, which don&#39;t require <br/>\nany of the Eclipse runtime to be in place.  In some places, Eclipse <br/>\nhelps with this: many interesting operations are defined and invoked on <br/>\ninterfaces that you can mock.  In some places, Eclipse gets in your <br/>\nway.  One example is that SWT is difficult to load at runtime without <br/>\nthe whole Eclipse runtime coming along for the ride.  However, there&#39;s a <br/>\ntip in the e-mail above that will get around that.<br/>\n<br/>\nWorse is that Eclipse often gets the implementors of those nice <br/>\ninterfaces by making direct static calls to unmockable runtime classes.  <br/>\nThis will push your design in a certain direction--you will need to wrap <br/>\nthese global services and override or mock them in your tests.  If your <br/>\nteam is test-infected, then this shouldn&#39;t be a problem.  If not, there <br/>\nmay be some grumbling about making your design more complicated &quot;just <br/>\nfor testing&quot;.  However, point out to them the ability gained to run <br/>\n100&#39;s of tests in under 5 seconds, compared to the 30 seconds it usually <br/>\ntakes just to boot the Eclipse runtime, and the even longer time it <br/>\ntakes to test manually.  Also, I find that the design pressures of <br/>\nwrapping the Eclipse services leads me to some nice model classes that <br/>\nare comprehensible even to people who know nothing about Eclipse, <br/>\nallowing me to leverage a much broader range of design advice and <br/>\nimplementation expertise.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you have more questions, please post them here; I find this to be a <br/>\nreally fun problem to work on.  Thanks,<br/>\n<br/>\n    David Saff<br/>\n<br/>\nKamal Ahmed wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; Hi,<br/>\n&gt; Does anyone have experience of developing JUnit tests for Eclipse based User<br/>\n&gt; Interface?<br/>\n&gt; The product being an Eclipse plugin.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The Interface/plugin is developed using:<br/>\n&gt; org.eclipse.ui<br/>\n&gt; org.eclipse.swt<br/>\n&gt; org.eclipse.jface<br/>\n&gt; org.eclipse.core.resources<br/>\n&gt; org.eclipse.ui.workbench<br/>\n&gt; org.eclipse.ui.navigator<br/>\n&gt; org.eclipse.ui.ide<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thanks,<br/>\n&gt; -Kamal.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; Yahoo!
