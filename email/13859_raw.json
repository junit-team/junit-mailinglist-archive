Could you do a little a=\r\nsking around?\n&gt; \n&gt; I have spoken with Kent and we have talked about what wo=\r\nuld be in the\n&gt; next release of JUnit. I have 3.8.2 right now, and I don&#39;t =\r\nknow whether\n&gt; it&#39;s been released to the public -- the most visible change =\r\nis better\n&gt; highlighting of the differences between unequal strings. :)\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; Expected: ab[c]def, but was: ab[dr]def\n&gt; \n&gt; The difference is in the brac=\r\nkets.\n\nOhhhh, nice. I could find a use for that. :-)\n\n&gt; Opening the kimono,=\r\n Kent invited me to be involved in JUnit 3.8.x and\n&gt; JUnit 4.0, then asked =\r\nme to do some code review for him, and I haven&#39;t\n&gt; done it, mostly due to l=\r\now motivation. For this reason I&#39;m not too hard\n&gt; on them for keeping thing=\r\ns under wraps: if I were really so intent on\n&gt; being involved, then I would=\r\n do what they ask me to do, but since I\n&gt; didn&#39;t, I don&#39;t complain. :)\n\nUnd=\r\nerstood. So there is some movement, albeit glacial in magnitude.\n\n&gt; &gt; Faili=\r\nng that, perhaps this group could decide what it really wanted\n&gt; &gt; and then=\r\n make the changes and release a 3.8.2? I mean, it&#39;s not like\n&gt; &gt; we don&#39;t h=\r\nave some of the finest testing brains on the planet around\n&gt; &gt; here (self _=\r\nnot_ included), not to mention some very strong opinions\n&gt; &gt; (ok, I&#39;m in th=\r\nis category). Just a wild Friday afternoon kind of\n&gt; &gt; thought.\n&gt; \n&gt; I stro=\r\nngly believe that even some of the best minds in this community\n&gt; don&#39;t sha=\r\nre the core philosophy of maintaining a small, closed\n&gt; framework. For that=\r\n reason, I&#39;m not too keen on &quot;opening it up&quot;. I don&#39;t\n&gt; really trust myself=\r\n with that, except for the fact that I&#39;ve never\n&gt; actually asked for an add=\r\nition to JUnit. I just think more people need\n&gt; to use the JUnit-addons tes=\r\nt runner. That would satisfy quite a few of\n&gt; them. :)\n\nI actually agree wi=\r\nth the substance of this. JUnit is extremely usable\nin it&#39;s current state, =\r\nbut I think that there are a few things that it\nwould be useful to add, suc=\r\nh as a pass or success method and make sure\nthat the classloaders were rock=\r\n-solid and that it didn&#39;t get into\nfights with ant. That&#39;s all I&#39;d ask to f=\r\nix. (I know that a\npass/success method would be syntactic sugar, but I thin=\r\nk it would be\nvery good documentary sugar, especially given the recent disc=\r\nussion on\nidioms for exception testing. :-)\n\nAfter those two things, I&#39;d wh=\r\noleheartedly agree with encouraging\npeople to use add-ons or extensions. Th=\r\ne only extension that I&#39;ve used\nis Mike Clark&#39;s JUnitPerf, and that was exc=\r\nellent.\n\nThanks for the information JB.\n\nSimon\n\n",
