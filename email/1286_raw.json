But then if we are accepting that testing\n&gt; &gt; public/friendly/protected methods adecuately test these methods, why not\n&gt;go\n&gt; &gt; one step beyond and say that black box testing is all we need? It seems to\n&gt; &gt; me that testing private methods is as useful and valid as testing\n&gt; &gt; non-private ones, just at a different level of granularity.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;snip\n&gt;\n&gt;     yes, you may test private methods. But that is not what actually is\n&gt;intended by unit testing. The idea is to write tests for the unit and\n&gt;thereby to specify what this unit is capable of. The idea of unit testing is\n&gt;not testing per se. The cool thing is that you finish writing your unit,\n&gt;when your tests pass, which cuts down time in testing and implementation.\n\n\n\n\nWhich is why HttpUnit does black-box testing\nor\nTerminology, shmerminology\n\n:)\n\nThat said, I do agree with you - methods labelled private shouldn&#39;t really \nneed to be tested - although after a serious refactoring you may end up \nloads of little methods that shouldn&#39;t be protected, nor package-protected, \nbut private... and testing some of them might be a nice idea.\n\nI have to say it&#39;s not something I&#39;ve ever worried about greatly - as was \npreviously said, testing the methods that use the private methods should \ncover it.\n\n\n\nJim\n\n\n\n\n\n\n--\n\n                           *   Jim Cheesman   *\n             Trabajo: \njchees@... - (34)(91) 724 9200 x 2360\n         On one hand, I&#39;m \nindecisive, but on the other, I&#39;m not.\n\n\n\n",
