Technically I<br/>\nhaven&#39;t done anything that can&#39;t already be done with ScalaTest and my hopes<br/>\nare that rather than spawning off a new framework, the good ideas are<br/>\nadopted in other frameworks and the bad ones die with this one. Right now<br/>\nI&#39;m primarily interested in running tests and poking around in the results<br/>\nrather than easing the testwriting itself. I&#39;m also curious where I can go<br/>\nwith JUnit as a primary foundation, basically conforming to rather than just<br/>\ninterfacing with JUnit. Mostly for fun. I decided to make it all public in<br/>\ncase it would be interesting to anyone else and for reference when blogging<br/>\netc.<br/>\nHow I &quot;solved&quot; pending and pendingUntilFixed was to use an AssumptionFailed<br/>\nexception since it is the closest thing to an ignored exception in JUnit.<br/>\nSince the existing runners don&#39;t treat the assumption-errors as ignored I<br/>\nsimply output &quot;pending &lt;reason&gt;&quot; messages on the console when being run. It<br/>\nwould be better to have the tests marked as ignored in eclipse but works as<br/>\na workaround.<br/>\nQuite early I got an idea about some primary goals when running from the<br/>\nREPL and the most important one was:<br/>\n<br/>\nminimize typing - completion is not always available in the REPL (from<br/>\neclipse, intellij and to my surprise even emacs (though there must be some<br/>\nway to pass the tab along down to the repl?))<br/>\n<br/>\nExamples of where this has led me:<br/>\n * Only one import<br/>\n * short package name even if it violates javas recommendations<br/>\n * package object with shortcuts to common stuff and a few implicits<br/>\n<br/>\nI really wanted scala tests easy executing of tests from the REPL. The<br/>\nJUnitCore approach is less elegant IMO and it seems like a System.exit in<br/>\nthe the cores main shuts down the REPL. That could be worked around of<br/>\ncourse by instatiation JUnitCore and passing the classes to run. A problem<br/>\nhere from a scala perspective is that Java&#39;s way to get a Class instance<br/>\n&lt;ClassName&gt;.class rolls off my fingers a bit more naturally than scalas<br/>\nclassOf[ClassName] (habit I guess). Long story short, I much prefer<br/>\nscalatests way and I think it&#39;s not strange that a language with a REPL<br/>\ninspires more thought in this department. My solution here was dynamic<br/>\nmixins (or static if one prefers). So with a simple &quot;with Basics&quot; you can<br/>\nrun any JUnit compatible test from the REPL.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow came the issue with customizing the output. I decided to put that<br/>\noutside the TestCase completely. It feels like a runtime decision. This is<br/>\nwhen &quot;run&quot; changed to really mean &quot;select&quot; (but the method on interaction is<br/>\nstill called run). Basically, the run method just returns a list of<br/>\nCallable[Result]-instances and the BriefReport calls the one by one and<br/>\nprints out the result. This way, the running and the reporting is nicely<br/>\nseparated and which testing style you choose has no bearing on the output<br/>\nyou see. The brief method could be paired with a verbose method if one<br/>\nwishes more verbose output.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow came the color/no color issue. Color feels like an aspect of reporting.<br/>\nThis might be a case of golden hammer but to represent this aspect as a<br/>\nstackable trait felt quite nice. Especially when creating instances of a<br/>\nreport: new Brief with Color. One could easily imagine expanding in this<br/>\ndirection: new Brief with Color with Summary with SourceDump with<br/>\nStackTraceFiltering with LongRunningTestTopList ExecutionTimeStatistics ...<br/>\n<br/>\nThe only problem (ok there are several probably by the obvious problem<br/>\nanyway) is keeping the default as elegant as ScalaTest&#39;s spec.execute hence<br/>\nthe package object in the poju4s package that allows me to write brief(spec)<br/>\ninstead.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I want to run just a few tests that can be done like this (here I assume<br/>\nI have already renamed the run-method to select):<br/>\nbrief(spec.select(&#39;example1, &#39;example2))<br/>\n<br/>\nThe fun part comes when I add glob:<br/>\n<br/>\nbiref(glob(&quot;package/*/*Spec&quot;)) or with an implicit:<br/>\nbrief(&quot;package/*/*Spec&quot;).<br/>\n<br/>\nI agree that named parameters also makes sense, or a combination:<br/>\nspec.execute(color=FunkyScheme, options=List[StackTraceFiltering,<br/>\nSourceDump, ExecutionTimeStatistics])<br/>\n<br/>\nI also tought about some sort of parameter dsl:<br/>\n<br/>\nspec.select(&#39;example1, &#39;example2) &gt;&gt;: StackTraceFiltering &gt;&gt;: Color &gt;&gt;:<br/>\nSourceDump &gt;&gt;: StdOut<br/>\n(not sure that would work or that I would like it but... as long as we&#39;re<br/>\ntossing up ideas)<br/>\n<br/>\nAs you say, when something fails what one really wants to see is which tests<br/>\nfailed. That is a missing part from my output, just effectively managed to<br/>\nclear those pesky succeeding tests out of the way while still mantaining<br/>\nsome feedback that they were actually run. I intend to address that as you<br/>\nsuggested, list the failing pending and ignored tests in the summary. I also<br/>\nintend to let the run return some sort of Gist or Summary object that allows<br/>\none to poke around a bit more in the result (after all it is a REPL so why<br/>\nshouldn&#39;t one be able to interact with the result?). Examples of what one<br/>\ncould do &quot;post&quot;-running is to dump captured std-out, stacktraces,<br/>\nexecutiontimes etc, list all the names of all tests of a given status or<br/>\nwhat have you. I think the best is to leave the information sort of naked<br/>\nand then scalas excellent collection API can do it&#39;s magic of filtering,<br/>\ngrouping and mapping to the users desire. Why not conveniently allow rerun<br/>\njust failed tests in this way?<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is really no reason why these things need to be isolated to just<br/>\nJUnit, in fact it feels like my original idea is much less interesting then<br/>\nto actually explore running and reporting from the REPL in general. For now<br/>\nit is convenient to focus on just one framework but perhaps in the future<br/>\nthe good parts can be distilled into a more framework agnostic run/report<br/>\nframework or the most sensible thing is to just leave the ideas out there<br/>\nwith a liberal license so that the ones that work can be adopted by<br/>\nframework-vendors as they please... I&#39;m not sure what is best yet but the<br/>\nlicense is chosen to not be an issue for this to happen :).<br/>\n<br/>\nLong story short: one import seems to be a good idea, separating running and<br/>\nreporting seems to be a good idea, and there seems to be some room for<br/>\ninnovating when running tests from the REPL...<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for listening to my ramblings! It&#39;s so much fun to play with these<br/>\nthings without the worries of actually maintaining it for years and years :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----------------------------------------------------<br/>\nJoakim Ohlrogge<br/>\nAgical AB<br/>\nV�sterl�nggatan 79, 2 tr<br/>\n111 29 Stockholm, SWEDEN<br/>\n<br/>\nMobile: +46-708-754004<br/>\nBlog: johlrogge.wordpress.com<br/>\nE-mail: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:joakim.ohlrogge@...\">joakim.ohlrogge@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Sat, Mar 12, 2011 at 1:25 AM, Bill Venners &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:bill@...\">bill@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Hi Joakim,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; On Fri, Mar 11, 2011 at 3:18 PM, Joakim Ohlrogge &lt;<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:joakim.ohlrogge@...\">joakim.ohlrogge@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; If anything useful comes out of it it can be contributed for sure.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; I&#39;ve chosen a quite liberal license (Beerware :)) in case someone else<br/>\n&gt;&gt; feels inspired to borrow/steal or contribute.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; I&#39;m a bit inspired. I&#39;m sure you&#39;re aware that there&#39;s a lot of stuff in<br/>\n&gt; ScalaTest to make writing JUnit tests in Scala more productive. And perhaps<br/>\n&gt; you&#39;re aware you can run ScalaTest tests in the Scala interpreter by<br/>\n&gt; invoking execute on them. So for example given this test:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; import org.scalatest.junit.JUnitSuite<br/>\n&gt; import scala.collection.mutable.ListBuffer<br/>\n&gt; import _root_.org.junit.Test<br/>\n&gt; import _root_.org.junit.Before<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; class HowSuite extends JUnitSuite {<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   var sb: StringBuilder = _<br/>\n&gt;   var lb: ListBuffer[String] = _<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   @Before def initialize() {<br/>\n&gt;     sb = new StringBuilder(&quot;ScalaTest is &quot;)<br/>\n&gt;     lb = new ListBuffer[String]<br/>\n&gt;   }<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   @Test def verifyEasy() {<br/>\n&gt;     sb.append(&quot;easy!&quot;)<br/>\n&gt;     assert(sb.toString === &quot;ScalaTest is easy!&quot;)<br/>\n&gt;     assert(lb.isEmpty)<br/>\n&gt;     lb += &quot;sweet&quot;<br/>\n&gt;   }<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   @Test def verifyFun() {<br/>\n&gt;     sb.append(&quot;fun!&quot;)<br/>\n&gt;     assert(sb.toString === &quot;ScalaTest is fun!&quot;)<br/>\n&gt;     assert(lb.isEmpty)<br/>\n&gt;   }<br/>\n&gt; }<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; You could run it in the interpreter like this (both ScalaTest and JUnit<br/>\n&gt; need to be on the classpath):<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; user-64-9-237-191:scalatest-1.3 bv$ scala -cp<br/>\n&gt; scalatest-1.3.jar:junit-4.4.jar<br/>\n&gt; Welcome to Scala version 2.8.0.final (Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM,<br/>\n&gt; Java 1.6.0_22).<br/>\n&gt; Type in expressions to have them evaluated.<br/>\n&gt; Type :help for more information.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; scala&gt; :load HowSuite.scala<br/>\n&gt; Loading HowSuite.scala...<br/>\n&gt; import org.scalatest.junit.JUnitSuite<br/>\n&gt; import scala.collection.mutable.ListBuffer<br/>\n&gt; import _root_.org.junit.Test<br/>\n&gt; import _root_.org.junit.Before<br/>\n&gt; defined class HowSuite<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; scala&gt; (new HowSuite).execute()<br/>\n&gt; Test Starting - line5$object$$iw$$iw$HowSuite: verifyEasy<br/>\n&gt; Test Succeeded - line5$object$$iw$$iw$HowSuite: verifyEasy<br/>\n&gt; Test Starting - line5$object$$iw$$iw$HowSuite: verifyFun<br/>\n&gt; Test Succeeded - line5$object$$iw$$iw$HowSuite: verifyFun<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Just create a new instance and call execute on it and it will run. (This is<br/>\n&gt; a JUnit 4 test class, so JUnit can run it jut fine. In this case you&#39;re<br/>\n&gt; asking ScalaTest to run it, though what ScalaTest does is turn around and<br/>\n&gt; ask JUnit to run it, capturing and displaying the results.) If you want to<br/>\n&gt; run just one of those tests you can specify it by name:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; scala&gt; (new HowSuite).execute(&quot;verifyFun&quot;)<br/>\n&gt; Test Starting - line5$object$$iw$$iw$HowSuite: verifyFun<br/>\n&gt; Test Succeeded - line5$object$$iw$$iw$HowSuite: verifyFun<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; And you can pass in config map of configuration information to execute if<br/>\n&gt; you want.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; It works, but it is ugly. The output has two problems. One is that because<br/>\n&gt; I loaded the class with :load into the interpreter, instead of compiling it,<br/>\n&gt; I get very long names for the class name with lots of dollar signs. So one<br/>\n&gt; enhancement would be to drop everything to the left of the first dollar<br/>\n&gt; sign. I&#39;m pretty sure I&#39;m doing that somewhere else in ScalaTest, so I could<br/>\n&gt; do it here.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The other annoyance is you get info on both TestStarting and TestSucceeded,<br/>\n&gt; two lines of info for each test. What I originally did was only format the<br/>\n&gt; output of BDD style test traits, because BDD was in part about output that<br/>\n&gt; looks like a spec, and TDD was not. But I&#39;ve gotten clear feedback that<br/>\n&gt; people using the non-BDD traits would like pretty output too, so I&#39;ve<br/>\n&gt; already decided to change that. So it should soon look something like:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; scala&gt; (new HowSuite).execute()<br/>\n&gt; HowSuite<br/>\n&gt; - verifyEasy<br/>\n&gt; - verifyFun<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Another thing I did originally was not show color when you use execute(),<br/>\n&gt; because I wasn&#39;t sure how to let people turn color off, and I felt it was<br/>\n&gt; worse to force color on people whose terminals didn&#39;t support it than the<br/>\n&gt; other way around. But people really like color. It is pretty and makes it<br/>\n&gt; more readable. So what I&#39;d like to do is figure out some way to let people<br/>\n&gt; configure color, full stack traces, and durations when using execute. Now<br/>\n&gt; that Scala has default params, that&#39;s probably the right way to do it. So<br/>\n&gt; color would be the default, and to turn it off you&#39;d say:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; scala&gt; (new HowSuite).execute(color = false)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; And lastly, your dots idea is interesting. Whenever I run with a standard<br/>\n&gt; out reporter, I get lots and lots and lots of green test names that passed.<br/>\n&gt; And what I really care about is the ones that failed. So I think it may make<br/>\n&gt; sense to add one more option to the standard out/err and file reporters that<br/>\n&gt; just shows one dot for each passed test. And then that could possibly be the<br/>\n&gt; default for execute, maybe.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; And lastly lastly, maybe execute should show a summary line at the end,<br/>\n&gt; like the runner does.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; As far as getting JUnit to do something like pending and pendingUntilFixed,<br/>\n&gt; that will be tough until JUnit can treat some kind of exception specially.<br/>\n&gt; Be nice to have a TestIgnoredException that gets reported as an ignored test<br/>\n&gt; in JUnit someday.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Bill<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;  Lets see where it goes. Right now it&#39;s mostly for fun.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; /J<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; -----------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Joakim Ohlrogge<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Agical AB<br/>\n&gt;&gt; V�sterl�nggatan 79, 2 tr<br/>\n&gt;&gt; 111 29 Stockholm, SWEDEN<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Mobile: +46-708-754004<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Blog: johlrogge.wordpress.com<br/>\n&gt;&gt; E-mail: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:joakim.ohlrogge@...\">joakim.ohlrogge@...</a><br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; On Fri, Mar 11, 2011 at 8:13 PM, David Saff &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:david@...\">david@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Joakim,<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Not silly at all.

I sort of thought that AssmptionError would be logical to be<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; displayed as ignored instead of succeeding hence the title.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Ideas?<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; -----------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Joakim Ohlrogge<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Agical AB<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; V�sterl�nggatan 79, 2 tr<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; 111 29 Stockholm, SWEDEN<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Mobile: &lt;%2B46-708-754004&gt;+46-708-754004<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Blog: johlrogge.wordpress.com<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; E-mail: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:joakim.ohlrogge@...\">joakim.ohlrogge@...</a><br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; ------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Yahoo!
