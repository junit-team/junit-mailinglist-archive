My reason seems to be different<br/>\n&gt; from any of the others I&#39;ve seen.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I don&#39;t give a hoot about the total number of assertions for whatever<br/>\n&gt; metrics purposes.  I do care about doing test-first coding appropriately.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; That means: code some context, code an assert.<br/>\n&gt; Make sure the assert fails.  Fix the assert.<br/>\n&gt; Add another assert to the same test method.<br/>\n&gt; Repeat until done with all things that assert against<br/>\n&gt; the given context for the test method.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; My problem is that my memory is poor, and I get<br/>\n&gt; distracted.  I just coded an assert and compiled.<br/>\n&gt; Or did I really compile?<br/>\n&gt; Drat, I forgot.<br/>\n&gt; Did I just add a new assert to the body of tests or did I not?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The count of assertions would be something visual that would change so I<br/>\n&gt; could get *feedback* and not have to trust myself.  It&#39;s part of<br/>\n&gt; the reason<br/>\n&gt; there is a count of tests, anyway.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; What if instead of being a count, it was a simple visual symbol<br/>\n&gt; that showed,<br/>\n&gt; for a given test class, that there is now a new assert that is<br/>\n&gt; being run for<br/>\n&gt; the first time?<br/>\n&gt; (could be a royal pain to figure out... consider if asserts are changed<br/>\n&gt; or deleted)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Or am I just slower than the majority of developers?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\">junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
