Our\n&gt; growing body of DBUnit-based tests are taking longer and longer to run\n&gt; and I feel it&#39;s hurting quality.\n&gt; \n&gt; Cavaet: I am not a database/SQL expert\n&gt; \n&gt; I installed hsqldb and tried to run our DDL file that creates our\n&gt; unit-test database against it.  We use Oracle for test/production now.\n&gt; The DDL is riddled with Oracle-specific cruft: NUMBER instead of\n&gt; INTEGER, VARCHAR2 vs VARCHAR, etc.\n&gt; \n&gt; Is there an easy way to take a DDL file like this and convert it into a\n&gt; format that HSQLDB will grok?  We currently use TOAD to generate the DDL\n&gt; file BTW if that matters.\n\nI personally wouldn&#39;t bother. The differences in behaviour between Oracle \nand HSQLDB would make the tests somewhat worthless...\n\nWhat I would do instead is aim at having a core number of integration tests \nwhich test a well-defined facade over the database, along with lots of unit \ntests which use an in-memory version of the facade. For bonus points: make \nthe unit tests have a pluggable facade, so you can run them against the \ndatabase instead overnight.\n\nRobert.\n\n-- \n                &quot;Software is too expensive to build cheaply&quot;\nRobert Watkins         http://twasink.net/          robertdw@...\n\n",
