For\n&gt;example, somewhere a private long variable becomes 0 because of some\n&gt;heavy computation and loss of precision (due to / or * for example).\n&gt;Your unit test may still be ok (first iteration of your methods) but it\n&gt;may be difficult to simulate the 10,000th iteration, or 1,000,000th\n&gt;iteration.  Accessing private fields may help you to quickly reset your\n&gt;classes into some state (like in a debugger).  But maybe JUnit is not\n&gt;the right tool for this kind of problems.\n\nHm. Not a good answer, but if you&#39;re losing precision after 1M iterations of \na loop, then you simply gotta have a test for that. If that test takes \nminutes to run, then it&#39;s entirely possible that your calculation needs to \nbe broken down into something less costly to test. Without a concrete \nexample, I can&#39;t say more. :)\n\n&gt;- when testing, you should ensure that the state of your object is valid\n&gt;(pre and post conditions).  If you use private variables and don&#39;t\n&gt;expose them via getters, it&#39;s difficult to assert their values (assert\n&gt;in Jdk1.4 is nice, inner classes are ugly)\n\nARGH! This violently breaks the beautiful encapsulation property that helps \ndefine OO programming. If you want to know whether an object is valid, send \nit the message &quot;isValid()&quot;. Let the object itself figure that out. If you \nwant to know whether an object satisfies its pre- and postconditions, the \nobject itself is the best judge. Send it &quot;verifyPrecondition()&quot; or \n&quot;verifyPostcondition()&quot;. There is no reason to break encapsulation, which is \nthe single most well-known anti-OO-pattern out there.\n\nOf course, it&#39;s annoying to add those methods to every object, so judge \nwhether it&#39;s important. In this one instance, it&#39;s a pity that Java isn&#39;t \nmore like Eiffel.\n\nWe routinely add isValid() methods to our model objects. It&#39;s especially \nuseful when populating a model object from a ResultSet and from parameters \nin an HTTP request.\n\nJ. B.
