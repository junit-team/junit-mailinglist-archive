And, by\n&gt; practiced I me=\r\nan, SERIOUSLY practiced.  I talk with a lot of groups who\n&gt; say they *do* u=\r\nnit testing but have just a handful of test, rarely run,\n&gt; and no consisten=\r\ncy, idea of code coverage, etc.\n&gt; \n&gt; I gave talks on JUnit and the develope=\r\nr testing revolution at two\n&gt; JavaOne conferences (2004 and 2006) where I t=\r\nalked about the three\n&gt; possible outcomes for the future of developer/unit =\r\ntesting:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Long-Term Defeat:  Theidea of developer testing was a nobl=\r\ne, notable,\n&gt; but ultimately short-lived blipin the history of software dev=\r\nelopment.\n&gt; Almost all developers went back to the old way of thinking: tes=\r\nting\n&gt; isfor QA.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Minor Victory: Developer testing does not disap=\r\npear, but it remains a\n&gt; nicheactivity.  Practiced only by a devoutminority=\r\n of test-infected\n&gt; developers.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Major Victory: Developer testing=\r\n becomes a standardsoftware development\n&gt; practice.  The rule,instead of th=\r\ne exception.  Releasingsoftware without\n&gt; unit/developer testing is as unth=\r\ninkable as releasing softwarewithout\n&gt; QA.\n&gt; \n&gt; I am rooting, of course, fo=\r\nr the major victory, but I am starting to\n&gt; have my doubts, and wondering w=\r\nhy progress is so slow.  Below is my\n&gt; analysis of what I believe is happen=\r\ning and I&#39;d be very interested in\n&gt; your opinion.\n&gt; \n&gt; In the past few year=\r\ns, I&#39;ve noticed that some developers are easily\n&gt; &quot;test-infected&quot;, others r=\r\nequire longer exposure and some encouragement\n&gt; but eventually &quot;get it&quot; , a=\r\nnd one group seems to have a built-in\n&gt; immunity.\n&gt; \n&gt; It&#39;s as if there are=\r\n 3 basic types of test genes:\n&gt; \n&gt; T1 - Very susceptpible to test infection=\r\n.  Show them a single JUnit\n&gt; example and they get it immediately - and sta=\r\nrt using it regularly and\n&gt; with great fervor.  When time pressure hits, th=\r\ney fight hard for enough\n&gt; time to test and would rather quit than produce =\r\ncode without tests. \n&gt; They often have framed pictures of Kent Beck on thei=\r\nr desk :-).\n&gt; \n&gt; T2 - Somewhat susceptible to test infection.  Show them ho=\r\nw to use\n&gt; JUnit/TDD, give them some encouragement and time to appreciate t=\r\nhe\n&gt; benefits and rewards; eventually they will become regular users.  When=\r\n\n&gt; time pressure hits, however, they often revert to no-test mode without\n&gt;=\r\n too much kicking and screaming.\n&gt; \n&gt; T3 -  Immune to test infection. There=\r\n&#39;s no amount of showing and\n&gt; convincing that will get them to practice dev=\r\neloper testing on their own\n&gt; with any regularity - if at all.  Many of the=\r\nm would rather quit than\n&gt; have to write tests on a regular basis.\n&gt; \n&gt; I w=\r\nould love to be able to say that these genes are somewhat evenly\n&gt; distribu=\r\nted.  A rough Gaussian distribution.  Something like this:\n&gt; \n&gt; T1: 30%\n&gt; T=\r\n2: 40%\n&gt; T3: 30%\n&gt; \n&gt; But my experience is that developers with the T3 gene=\r\n outnumber the\n&gt; combined number of those with T2 and T1 gene.\n&gt; \n&gt; This sp=\r\nells trouble because I have also found that when developers\n&gt; become manage=\r\nrs they bring with them their attitudes toward developer\n&gt; testing.  And a =\r\nT3 manager is not going to provide an environment where\n&gt; the T2 (the ones =\r\nthat require some time and encouragement) can become\n&gt; test infected.   And=\r\n this might explain why developer testing is still\n&gt; practiced by a minorit=\r\ny of developers in a minority of organizations.\n&gt; \n&gt; Feedback?\n&gt; \n&gt; Alberto=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; http://www.junitfactory.com\n&gt; Generate JUnit tests.
