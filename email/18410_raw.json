I don&#39;t usually associate &quot;clever&quot; with &quot;keep is\nsimp=\r\nle stupid&quot; but maybe that&#39;s just me.  I think a beautiful JUnit test\nwould =\r\nbe one that uses both inheritance and the &quot;parameterized test\ncase&quot; pattern=\r\n to be as short and sweet (and therefore maintainable) as\npossible.

The \n&gt; &quot;catch&quot; is that I have to contribute testi=\r\nng-related examples \n&gt; - in other words: beautiful test code.  \n&gt; \n&gt; I alre=\r\nady have some ideas of what to cover, but I thought \n&gt; some of the people i=\r\nn this group might have some examples of \n&gt; tests that they consider partic=\r\nularly &quot;beautiful&quot; or clever \n&gt; in their approach.\n&gt; \n&gt; I think it&#39;s great =\r\nthat developer testing has reached the \n&gt; point that some authors/editors t=\r\nhought of including testing \n&gt; in such a book, and I want to make sure I pi=\r\nck the best \n&gt; possible example(s) to pick from.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt; \n&gt; Alberto\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; Yahoo!
