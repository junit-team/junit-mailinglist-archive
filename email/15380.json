What I mean is this. I tried using<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the batchtest task which is severely limited. It only does a directory<br/>\n&gt; &gt; scan over my test source to pick up the test classes. The problem is<br/>\n&gt; &gt; sometimes I may include abstract classes under that umbrella for<br/>\n&gt; &gt; conveniece methods and they get picked up too. Also there is no<br/>\n&gt; &gt; garauntee that the source and class files will be one for one. (Eg.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; nested classes would go unnoticed as well as source files that<br/>\n&gt; &gt; don&#39;t/can&#39;t compile to a equivalent named class.) I would feel alot<br/>\n&gt; &gt; better if I could filter the .class files instead of the source and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; pull out only the classes that are TESTABLE. That is, classes that<br/>\n&gt; &gt; begin or end with &quot;Test&quot; and have at least one public no-arg method<br/>\n&gt; &gt; beginning with &quot;test&quot;.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; So I plugged in DirectorySuiteBuilder from the junit addons project<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and added some custom code to accomplish this. My custom code, a class<br/>\n&gt; &gt; named DirectoryScannerSuiteBuilder, is included below. The problem<br/>\n&gt; &gt; with that approach, while it is a lot more accurate, is that the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; junitreport task now lumps all tests under my custom<br/>\n&gt; &gt; DirectoryScannerSuiteBuilder class name without separating out the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; detail. So my question is what would the best approach be? Should I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; stop being anal and just go with the batchtest approach and stop<br/>\n&gt; &gt; including abstracts under the test source directory? (Incedentally<br/>\n&gt; &gt; that&#39;s what I&#39;m resoting to now.) Or is there a more elaborate<br/>\n&gt; &gt; solution sort of like a best of breed between the two approaches I&#39;ve<br/>\n&gt; &gt; tried so far?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;  &lt;CLIP&gt;a bunch of code&lt;/CLIP&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;  ------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>",
