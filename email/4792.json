So simply use both <br/>\nmethods in a test to be sure that you can read back what you have just <br/>\nsaved.  It will be very helpful if your database or object model changes.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother solution can be to use Mock objects, but I personally think that <br/>\nit is overkilling for databases.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf your database tests take too long to execute, you can just execute <br/>\nthem each night, instead of every time.  Search for &quot;Continuous <br/>\nIntegration&quot; on Sourceforge.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; 2) &lt;b&gt; How can you verify the execution path that a<br/>\n&gt; program is taking unless its output returned is unique<br/>\n&gt; for that path? &lt;/b&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>So you mean that your program is unpredictable?  So when you do the same <br/>\nthing twice with your program, you have two different results... really <br/>\neasy to learn ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nMore seriously, if you have a random program (let&#39;s say a roulette) it&#39;s <br/>\nalways possible to change the random mechanism so that the generation of <br/>\nnumbers is predictable (1, 2, 3, 4...).  Use Mock objects for that purpose.<br/>\n<br/>\nhth<br/>\n<br/>\n-Vladimir<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nVladimir Bossicard<br/>\nwww.bossicard.com</div>",
