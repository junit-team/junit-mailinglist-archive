Write a test to manifest each reported bug before\ndoing anythi=\r\nng to fix it.  These will often be of the end-to-end or\nintegration variety=\r\n already recommended.  \n\nBesides accumulating a regression suite, this has =\r\na couple of other\nbenefits.  First, bugs tend to occur in clusters, so you&#39;=\r\nll tend to\naccumulate the most tests for the most problematic code.    Seco=\r\nnd,\nthe code that is the most problematic will probably also be the\nhardest=\r\n to test, encouraging refactoring.  Again, focusing on bug\nhot-spots tends =\r\nto focus your efforts where they&#39;re needed most.\n\nGood hunting,\nLance\n\n--- =\r\nIn junit@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Nat Pryce&quot; &lt;nat.pryce@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; On 15/01/2=\r\n008, Chris Dollin &lt;chris.dollin@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; On Tuesday 15 January 2008 =\r\n09:47, csabcsi.szucs wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; I meant the following:\n&gt; &gt;  &gt;  I can=\r\nnot do a TDD this time, because I have already an existing\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; project w=\r\nith about 100 production classes (and some time to\nlearn and\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; exercis=\r\ne JUnit tests).\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  Read Michael Feathers&#39; book /Working Effectively w=\r\nith Legacy Code/.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; So which class shall I start with to write JUn=\r\nit tests for? Perhaps\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; it is worth starting with a class that does no=\r\nt have any\ncollaborators\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; or only ones that are already tested in a p=\r\nrevious &quot;test phase&quot;.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  I&#39;d suggest classes which are likely to be w=\r\norked on &quot;soon&quot;.\nThose are,\n&gt; &gt;  after all, the ones which you might otherw=\r\nise break, and for which\n&gt; &gt;  unit tests will add most value.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  It&#39;s=\r\n tempting to start with &quot;easy&quot; ones, but you run the risk of\nwriting\n&gt; &gt;  t=\r\nests for things that won&#39;t change and won&#39;t break, and you&#39;d gain an\n&gt; &gt;  u=\r\nnrealistic view of how easy it is(n&#39;t) to add tests post-hoc.\n&gt; \n&gt; All good=\r\n advice.\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;d also cover the code with end-to-end tests.\n&gt; \n&gt; Unit test=\r\ns give you a lot of feedback about the internal quality of\n&gt; your code (is =\r\nit maintainable, readable, decoupled, cohesive etc.),\n&gt; but less feedback a=\r\nbout the external quality of the code (is it good\n&gt; enough for purpose).\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; End-to-end and integration tests give you more feedback about the\n&gt; exte=\r\nrnal quality of your code, but less feedback about its internal\n&gt; quality. =\r\n E.g. the tell you whether all the pieces work together, but\n&gt; not whether =\r\nthe pieces are well structured and easily (un)pluggable.\n&gt; \n&gt; If you&#39;ve alr=\r\neady got a lot of code, feedback about its internal\n&gt; quality now is a bit =\r\nlate in the day.  I expect you&#39;re concerned about\n&gt; regressions as you add =\r\nbehaviour.  So, I would concentrate on\n&gt; integration and end-to-end tests t=\r\no ensure correct system behaviour.\n&gt; \n&gt; It&#39;s worth adding unit tests for ne=\r\nw classes as you add new behaviour.\n&gt; They will also help you to discover w=\r\nhere the code is difficult to\n&gt; maintain and help you introduce flex points=\r\n.  At that point you can\n&gt; start refactoring the existing code, where it to=\r\nuches the new code, to\n&gt; make it more testable and more easily surround the=\r\n refactored with\n&gt; unit tests.  You&#39;ll feel more confident that you aren&#39;t =\r\nbreaking\n&gt; anything because the end-to-end tests will help detect any regre=\r\nssions\n&gt; the changes cause.\n&gt; \n&gt; --Nat\n&gt;\n\n\n\n",
