We are using an in-house developed code generator that uses an xml file and an 4 xsl files and transform them into four Java classes.  The Java classes serve as the data abstraction layer.  I would like to maintain some tracebility from the customer who describes the business process and the code that makes the calls to the database.  Has anyone had experience with this type of thing?  If so, please offer suggestions on how to use Junit to do this and the tests that I might use.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\nDavid</div>",
