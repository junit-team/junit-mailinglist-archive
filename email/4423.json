I got tied up really bad with the project I am working on.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyhow, I finally got the problem fixed. Initially I had some <br/>\nproblems with it because I am using ANT, but I figured out WHY I was <br/>\nhaving the problem and resolved it. Here&#39;s what I did:<br/>\n<br/>\n1) Installed ANT and configured accordingly (remember to install the <br/>\n   option tasks jar as well).<br/>\n2) Installed JUnit.<br/>\n   2.1) Copied junit.jar to $ANT_HOME/lib so that &lt;junit&gt; optional<br/>\n        task would work.<br/>\n   2.2) Copied junit.jar to $APP_HOME/lib, which is where I store all<br/>\n        of my 3rd party jars, that way JUnit would work with forked<br/>\n        processes from ANT.<br/>\n   2.3) Extracted the file excluded.properties from junit.jar into <br/>\n        $APP_HOME/lib and added entries for org.w3c.dom.* and <br/>\n        org.xml.sax.*<br/>\n3) Updated my ANT scripts to make sure that my &lt;junit&gt; task had <br/>\n   fork=&quot;yes&quot; in its attributes.<br/>\n4) Updated my ANT scripts so that the &lt;classpath&gt; referenced by my <br/>\n   &lt;junit&gt; task included $APP_HOME/lib/excluded.properties before <br/>\n   anything else.<br/>\n<br/>\nI like this approach because it means I can leave the original <br/>\njunit.jar intact and I can add new elements to the file without <br/>\nhaving to constantly update the JAR file. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe gotcha I was running into was with the fork=&quot;yes&quot; attribute on <br/>\nthe &lt;junit&gt; task. I think this may have been caused by ANT having <br/>\nalready loaded the XML bits so running JUnit in the same JVM instance <br/>\nmay have been problematic. Before I added that attribute I could <br/>\noutput the excluded property&#39;s contents and would see the entries for <br/>\norg.w3c.dom.* and org.xml.sax.*, but I kept getting the same error... <br/>\nNow that I&#39;ve added that attribute the only exceptions I&#39;m getting <br/>\nare from my own code.... which means.... I&#39;m back to the grind... :)<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\n<br/>\nSam W.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In junit@y..., &quot;numbsafari&quot; &lt;numbsafari@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; Another idea would be to update the FAQ so that this particular <br/>\n&gt; problem could be more readily associated with the FAQ that provides <br/>\n&gt; the answer.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Right now the title is: &quot;I get a ClassNotFoundException when I use <br/>\n&gt; the LoadingTestRunner&quot;.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The title should be: &quot;Why do I am I having problems with Third <br/>\nParty <br/>\n&gt; JAR files (ClassNotFoundException/LinkageError)?&quot; Or something <br/>\n&gt; similar.

I know, I know... if I don&#39;t like it I should <br/>\ndo <br/>\n&gt; better... Well, I&#39;ve only been using J/Unit for a couple of days <br/>\nnow <br/>\n&gt; so I&#39;m not prepared yet to write docs. As I get more involved with <br/>\nit <br/>\n&gt; I definately plan on putting together a couple of HOWTO&#39;s.. until <br/>\n&gt; then, I&#39;d just like to say that the docs are horrible. Great <br/>\nproduct <br/>\n&gt; (from what I&#39;ve seen so far), horrible documentation.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Sam W.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --- In junit@y..., Scott Stirling &lt;sstirling@m...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Holy FAQ, Batman!

[mailto:qingfenglin@y...]<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I was trying to use Junit to test a simple XML program as <br/>\n&gt; following:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>\n=================================================================<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; public void testNewInstance() throws Exception{<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;        DocumentBuilderFactory dbf = <br/>\n&gt; DocumentBuilderFactory.newInstance<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ();<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;        DocumentBuilder db = dbf.newDocumentBuilder();<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;        Document doc = db.newDocument();<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;        doc.createElement(&quot;test&quot;);<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;    }<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ==============================================================<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; If I used the Text interface to run the use case, the test is <br/>\nOK, <br/>\n&gt; but <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; if I use GUI interface, I got the exception as following:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; java.lang.LinkageError: Class org/w3c/dom/Document violates <br/>\n&gt; Loader <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; constraint<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ..<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ..<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ..<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; at junit.runner.TestCaseLoader.loadClass<br/>\n(TestCaseClassLoader.java <br/>\n&gt; 104)<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ..<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Is that consider as a bug of JUnit? </span></blockquote></div>",
