In southeast MI a future for =\r\nautomotive manufacturing is not a\nforegone conclusion.  (Today:\nhttp://www.=\r\ndetnews.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=3D/20060914/AUTO01/609140365/\n1148 ) =\r\n\n\nA quote from the above article as it relates to Ford Motor Company (not m=\r\ny\nemployer):\n\n&quot;They&#39;ve got to get 40 to 50 percent of the people out the do=\r\nor. It&#39;s just\ngot to be a lot smaller company.&quot;\n\nIn this climate, it is dif=\r\nficult for me to be proponent of a new technology\nunless it absolutely (une=\r\nquivocally) demonstrates business value, a.k.a\n&quot;payback&quot;.  For every hour i=\r\nnvested in presenting, clarifying, documenting,\ncascading organizational (o=\r\nften hidden) effort - there absolutely must be\nmore than an hour of effecti=\r\nveness derived.\n\nI&#39;m not at the point where I can in good faith encourage a=\r\n (large)\norganization to change from using &quot;test&quot; to &quot;@Test&quot; to declare a t=\r\nest method\n- while being aware of many (but certainly not all) of the casca=\r\nding costs\nof this position.  We can not promote a technology because it is=\r\n new,\npopular or &quot;better&quot;.  It has to be more effective in a business conte=\r\nxt.\n\nThat&#39;s my opinion - and I&#39;m sticking to the &quot;business value&quot; assertion=\r\n.  I&#39;m\nwilling promote change from &quot;test&quot; to &quot;@Test&quot; if someone appreciatin=\r\ng (the\nmagnitude of) hidden costs associated with large organization techno=\r\nlogy\nchange can establish a compelling business case.  \n\nAt the moment, I&#39;m=\r\n not seeing the value of the change in my own tests.\n\n_Marvin (MDT)\n\n\nPoste=\r\nd by: &quot;Mark Levison&quot; mlevison@... =A0 marklevison \nThu Sep=A014,=A020=\r\n06 5:53=A0am (PST) \n\n\nOnce JUnit 4.xxx is back ported it would be possible =\r\nfor you to write your\nown base class implementation just as you describe.\n\n=\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt; MDT - agreed.\n\n...\n\nFrom experience in the .NET world there is some rea=\r\nl advantage to declaring\ntests using Attributes/Annotation. It makes it pos=\r\nsible to  derive your test\nclass from some other class.\n\n\nMarvin it sounds =\r\nlike what you want is an upgraded Junit 3.8.1 with better\nsupport for fixtu=\r\nre setup/teardown. Is that the case?\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt; MDT - yes.  That sounds like the =\r\nmost cost effective approach.\n\nWhat I want is the declarative approach for =\r\nbuilding tests (pioneered by\nNUnit, used by MBUnit and TestNG) made availab=\r\nle to for Java 1.4.\n\n...\n \nCheers\nMark\n\n-----------------------------------=\r\n----------------------\n|=A0 USA Cell: 248.866.4897 (free incoming)\n|=A0 Mes=\r\nsage: 2488664897@...\n|=A0 Email: MarvinToll@...\n|=\r\n=A0 Web: http://www.gtcGroup.com\n------------------------------------------=\r\n---------------\n\n\n\n\n",
