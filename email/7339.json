I just<br/>\n&gt; found it non-intuitive that JUnit gave each test method invocation its<br/>\n&gt; own instance, especially when they also provided the setUp() method. I<br/>\n&gt; used JUnit a long time before I realized this object wrapping was going<br/>\n&gt; on. In a previous post to this list, I asked if anyone could help me<br/>\n&gt; understand what benefit I get for that wrapping. I mentioned that the<br/>\n&gt; only benefit I could see was that if I screw up my  setUp() and<br/>\n&gt; tearDown() methods and don&#39;t actually initialize and clean up the<br/>\n&gt; fixture correctly, the wrapping of method invocations may let me get<br/>\n&gt; away with it. Vladimir Bossicard agreed that that was a benefit, and no<br/>\n&gt; one else offered any others.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Having grown up with JUnit - and vice versa - I don&#39;t find the<br/>\ninstance-per-test approach unintuitive any more. It gives me the maximum<br/>\nseparation between two tests, and that&#39;s a good thing.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother benefit is that you can build suites with just selected test cases<br/>\nfrom a given test class.<br/>\n<br/>\nJohannes</div>",
