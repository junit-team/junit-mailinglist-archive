I just want that manager to SAY IT. To me, that&#39;s <br/>\nimportant. I won&#39;t be complicit in an unspoken scheme to go slower, <br/>\nbecause at the end of the day, when we don&#39;t go fast enough, the <br/>\nexecutives will rain on the managers will rain on me. No thanks.<br/>\n<br/>\nPROGRAMMER: &quot;As long as we&#39;re clear that the corporate standard is more <br/>\nimportant than how productive I can be as a programmer, I&#39;m fine with <br/>\nthat. By the way, I won&#39;t be working any unpaid overtime this year. <br/>\nSorry about that.&quot;<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJ. B.
