As pa=\r\nrt of the testing, I want to keep a log of the responses from the code for =\r\ndebugging purposes.  It would be really helpful to have some simple process=\r\n to print out the tests name and other properties into the log.  Since ther=\r\ne are hundreds of tests, I would like to make this a common step (ie call a=\r\n method) to do this.  Problem is finding the name of the test itself (witho=\r\nut having to pass it into the logging method or hacking the stack).\n\nI see =\r\nthere is a Description class in the runner.  Is there any way to access the=\r\n runner (i.e. a singleton or static getter) from the test case?\n\n\n",
