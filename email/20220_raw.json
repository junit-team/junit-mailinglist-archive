The  cross-product of all the\npossible arguments and data can become very large very quickly.  For\nexample, let&#39;s say the method1()  could take arguments like  this:\n\nArg1.... 8 possible options.\nArg2..... 12 possible options\nArg3.........yes or no...2 options\nArg4...... 4  possible options\n\n\n  So at first  glance, to test this completely with all permutations of\ndata, you might think of the cross-product of the arguments  ....8 x 12\nx 2 x 4  .... =  768.  Wow....that is a lot of tests to write!\n\n\nSo ...yes, there is code coverage for answering questions of\ncompleteness ....but I just found maybe another approach as well.\n\nThe .pdf below the article in the link describes  an approach for\ndetermining the number of tests required for testing an  application\nthat is apparently almost as complete and thorough as the \ncross-product, but much more manageable from a testing perspective.  The\narticle  discusses 3 approaches.  I actually tried the 2nd approach on\nthe  example above...using a free download discussed in the essay called\n&#39;allpairs&#39; .\n\nRather than 768 tests in the cross-product of all the arguments ...the\nprogram  defined a mere 58 tests using specific combinations of data . \nOr so says this this theory.\n\nInteresting.\nMike\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n",
