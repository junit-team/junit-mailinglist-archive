At no costs I want to manually\n&gt;exclude the test classes during shipment. Addiditonally I simply find\n&gt;this approach more structured - in our last project we had for each\n&gt;package a .test package.\n&gt;The separate package however has the main drawback for me that I cant\n&gt;test package private methods. This forces me to make more methods\n&gt;public than I want just for testing purposes.\n&gt;\n&gt;What are your experiences and preferences in this area ?\n\n\nI have them in the same package, and use ant to exclude them when I do a \nfull build.\n\nThis does force you to use a consistent naming scheme for the classes, but \nI don&#39;t find that to be too much of a problem.\n\n\n\n\n--\n\n                           *   Jim Cheesman   *\n             Trabajo: \njchees@... - (34)(91) 724 9200 x 2360\n  In retrospect it becomes clear \nthat hindsight is definitely overrated\n\n\n\n",
