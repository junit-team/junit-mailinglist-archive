So, sure, you can use JUnit for this sort of simple<br/>\nperformance testing, but you should at least run the tests enough times to<br/>\nbuild statistical confidence in the results.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt didn&#39;t show up in these few runs, but I believe that I have noticed<br/>\nbefore that the first test reported a much longer than normal time --<br/>\nseconds rather than milliseconds.  So the order in which tests are run<br/>\nmight introduce an effect large enough to render the results useless.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJim Dixon  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jdd@...\">jdd@...</a>   tel +44 117 982 0786  mobile +44 797 373 7881</div>",
