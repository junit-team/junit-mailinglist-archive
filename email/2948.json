It appears that many <br/>\n&gt;people think there are &quot;magic formulas&quot; for working with JUnit. <br/>\n&gt;As a result, they ask silly questions like, &quot;How do I test an <br/>\n&gt;EJB with JUnit????&quot; The people who know the answer get so <br/>\n&gt;tired of writing, &quot;Search this list. Try it. What are you<br/>\n&gt;having trouble testing?&quot; that they simply stop responding. <br/>\n&gt;As a result, questions are not being answered.<br/>\n................<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t agree with these opinions. I think there has been <br/>\nvery good questions and answers (discussions) here. Of course <br/>\nit is good if the answers can already be found in a FAQ<br/>\nbut remember that the FAQ is something that is maintained<br/>\nusually by one person as on a list like this you can have several<br/>\nviews. Take as an example the answers yesterday of why you should use <br/>\nJUnit. I am sure you can find data on this already somewhere else. <br/>\n<br/>\nJUnit is a new thing for many people and this list must also be<br/>\navailable to new users and not only to those who have already<br/>\ngot an answer to all questions.<br/>\n<br/>\nKaarle Kaila </span></blockquote></div>",
