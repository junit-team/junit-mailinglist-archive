If Ant can do what make can do, when why is Ant any less<br/>\n&gt;&gt;suited to building the JDK/JVM than make?<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;So said Timothy Wall on 4/27/2003 --------------------<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;Aside from neither of these existing when they originally set up the <br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;build and test processes, ant is less suited than make to managing a <br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;large, complex project that consists of a wide range dependencies and<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;tasks.  Can you imaging trying to use ant to build a VM?<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;In short, because ANT doesn&#39;t have built-in, precompiled and configured <br/>\n&gt;dependency rules and flags for things like &quot;cc&quot;, &quot;ld&quot;, and so on.  These<br/>\n&gt;are things that <br/>\n&gt;are trivially constructed in a shell call or make dependency rules, but<br/>\n&gt;rather complex, <br/>\n&gt;verbose, and circuitous when wrapped in XML.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>So am I correct to paraphrase you this way? &quot;There aren&#39;t the proper Ant tasks to support building native applications written in C/C++&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf so, then Ant&#39;s not the problem. I&#39;m just trying to understand, so don&#39;t feel like I&#39;m contradicting you for the sake of it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Yes, ant *can* do other things besides compile sets of java files for use<br/>\n&gt;by javac and <br/>\n&gt;jar, but it&#39;s not necessarily well-suited to do so.<br/>\n&gt;It is one thing to say ant can do what make can do (after all, you can<br/>\n&gt;always write <br/>\n&gt;more Java code, right?).  It is another to actually do it.  <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>&quot;make&quot; was built to support the environment of the day. Ant is also built that way. You&#39;re right: Ant doesn&#39;t support &quot;make&quot;&#39;s native environment very well, but that&#39;s just because no-one has wanted to do it, I guess.<br/>\n<br/>\nTake care.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nJ.
