These Adapters modify the\nbehavior of the Engine, but are=\r\nn&#39;t directly related to it&#39;s main\nfunction, so aren&#39;t part of it&#39;s API. The=\r\n first Adapter is a Lock\nobject with lock, unlock and isLocked methods, whe=\r\nn the Engine is\nlocked is prevents write and delete operations. The other A=\r\ndapter is a\ngeneric Control object for other operations. The Adapter object=\r\ns have\nno meaning without reference to an Engine object.\n\n** It is these Ad=\r\napter classes that I want to test. **\n\nEach Adapter Class has its&#39; own Adap=\r\nterTest TestCase class set of\ntests. The thing is, that I want to perform e=\r\nach set of test four\ntimes, using an Adapter &quot;hitched&quot; to each of the diffe=\r\nrent Engine\nconfigurations. Initially I thought to extend the two basic\nAda=\r\npterTest classes, leaving the derived classes to create the Engine\ninstance=\r\n to run the tests with, and then run those extended classes,\nbut that gives=\r\n me [at least] ten classes with much duplicate code and\nseems rather clunky=\r\n. Is there any way to refactor the Engine creation\nor whatever, in order to=\r\n achieve a more elegant solution, or a perhaps\ncompletely different solutio=\r\nn to this repeat-test issue?\n\nThe following is a much simplified code listi=\r\nng. The problem is, that\nthis code, only tests one of the four variations o=\r\nn the Engine object,\nwhile I need to test all four. In order for the tests =\r\nto be\nautomatically runnable, I can&#39;t pass in any parameters to the test\ncl=\r\nasses. So I&#39;m looking for another way to do this, other than having\nto crea=\r\nte four derived classes for each Adapter TestCase, with a\ndifferent impleme=\r\nntation of setup().\n\nAnd ideas or pointers, folks?\n\nclass EngineLock {\n    =\r\nprotected Engine m_engine;\n\n    public EngineLock      (Engine engine) {...=\r\n}\n    public boolean lock    () {...}\n    public boolean unlock  () {...}\n =\r\n   public boolean isLocked() {...}\n}\n\nclass EngineControl {\n    protected E=\r\nngine m_engine;\n\n    public EngineControl       (Engine engine) {...}\n    p=\r\nublic boolean doSomething () {...}\n    public boolean doOtherThing() {...}\n=\r\n}\n\nclass Engine {\n    protected final boolean m_persistent;\n    protected f=\r\ninal boolean m_redundant;\n    protected EngineLock    m_lock;\n    protected=\r\n EngineControl m_controller;\n\n    public Engine (boolean persistent, boolea=\r\nn redundant) {\n        m_lock       =3D new EngineLock (this);\n        m_co=\r\nntroller =3D new EngineControl (this);\n        //...\n    }\n    public boole=\r\nan read   (Object template) {...}\n    public boolean write  (Object templat=\r\ne) {...}\n    public boolean delete (Object template) {...}\n\n    EngineLock =\r\n    getLock    () { return m_lock; }\n    EngineControl  getControl () { ret=\r\nurn mcontroller; }\n}\n\nAnd then we have the TestCase classes, which both cre=\r\nate Engine\ninstances as part of their setup, and then use the Adapter of th=\r\nat\nengine in the tests.\n\nclass TestEngineLock extends TestCase {\n    protec=\r\nted Engine     m_engine;\n    protected EngineLock m_lock;\n\n    protected vo=\r\nid setUp() {\n        m_engine =3D new Engine (true, true); // &lt;&lt;=3D=3D engi=\r\nne for test.\n        m_lock   =3D m_engine.getLock();      // &lt;&lt;=3D=3D test=\r\n object.\n    }\n\n    public void testEngineLock() {...}\n    public void test=\r\nLock      () {...}\n    public void testUnlock    () {...}\n    public void t=\r\nestIsLocked  () {...}\n}\n\nclass TestEngineControl extends TestCase {\n    pro=\r\ntected Engine        m_engine;\n    protected EngineControl m_controller;\n\n =\r\n   protected void setUp() {\n        m_engine =3D new Engine (true, true); /=\r\n/ &lt;&lt;=3D=3D engine for test.\n        m_controller =3D m_engine.getControl();=\r\n // &lt;&lt;=3D=3D test object.\n    }\n\n    public void testEngineControl() {...}\n=\r\n    public void testDoSomething  () {...}\n    public void testDoOtherThing =\r\n() {...}\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
