Back to the original question.. it really varies. I&#39;ve\nvisited teams that have a pretty good handle on cohesion and coupling,\nand adding tests isn&#39;t that hard for them. Other teams have a very hard\ntime, their code is so mangled, it&#39;s difficult even to start. If I had\nto offer advice in a nutshell, it would be to look at dependency\ninjection and either use it or use it as an idea. You can get a lot of\nmileage out of the technique of taking dependencies and passing them in\nthrough the constructor so that they can be mocked in test and real in\nproduction code.\n\nMichael Feathers\nwww.objectmentor.com\nmichaelfeathers.typepad.com\n\nMatthias Schmidt wrote:\n\n&gt;Hello all,\n&gt; \n&gt;Here&#39;s what I would like to add:\n&gt;It is often very hard to implement unit tests after coding the application, because the programmer did not have UNITS in mind when coding. So it is not so easy to have a look at at one code unit at a time.\n&gt; \n&gt;So it could easily be the case that writing the tests afterwards will take a lot more time because you have to refactor your whole code before you can even start to implement the actual tests. Or to put it the other way round: TDD makes you write more modular, easier to read and maintain code.\n&gt; \n&gt;Best regards,\n&gt;Matt\n&gt;\n&gt;________________________________\n&gt;\n&gt;From: junit@yahoogroups.com [mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com] On Behalf Of C��dric Beust ? \n&gt;Sent: Friday, February 16, 2007 5:48 PM\n&gt;To: junit@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;Subject: Re: [junit] additional expenses\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Hi Felix,\n&gt;\n&gt;This is an interesting question, and I don&#39;t think it&#39;s been brought up here\n&gt;before.\n&gt;\n&gt;In my experience, this is a bit hard to quantify, but it&#39;s probably fair to\n&gt;say that while the cost appears a bit on the high side initially (especially\n&gt;if the developers on your team are not used to writing tests and that there\n&gt;is no existing testing infrastructure), it tends to decrease over time as\n&gt;programmers become more experienced in writing tests, reuse or create test\n&gt;base classes and tend to write solid tests in their first iteration.\n&gt;\n&gt;Although it&#39;s obviously hard to prove or disprove, I would probably say that\n&gt;at the very beginning, it&#39;s not rare to spend as much time writing a test as\n&gt;it is to implement the corresponding feature. That first test is always\n&gt;very expensive, especially if it&#39;s an area of your product that has no tests\n&gt;at all. It all gets better after that.\n&gt;\n&gt;Hope it helps, and looking forward to other people&#39;s answers.\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\n\n",
