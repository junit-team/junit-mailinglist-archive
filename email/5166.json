See <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://abbot.sourceforge.net\">http://abbot.sourceforge.net</a><br/>\n<br/>\nI tried developing programmatic extensions to java.awt.Robot to use for <br/>\ntests, and using JFCUnit.  Both resulted in a real pain writing code, <br/>\nand something developers only used if I forced them and QA certainly <br/>\ncouldn&#39;t use.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I abstracted the layer of user actions to be invoked from a <br/>\nhand-editable XML script, which also supports assertions for testing <br/>\npurposes.  I still have to push the developers, but now QA is writing <br/>\nsome of the tests.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe result is the abbot testing framework.  Each script encapsulate <br/>\nsemantic user actions mixed with testing assertions to verify GUI <br/>\nstate.  The scripts can be invoked from a JUnit Test case (one is <br/>\nprovided) and the failures/errors will show up as in any other JUnit <br/>\ntest.  There&#39;s also a script editor which provides recording capability <br/>\n(which is far easier and quicker than painstakingly programming &quot;move <br/>\nhere, click here, move here, click here, move here, click here&quot;.  Also, <br/>\nsince it&#39;s a script, there is no extra compile step when building and <br/>\ndebugging tests.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Tuesday, June 11, 2002, at 10:38 AM, Luca Sfarzo wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The main fact stil remains: do you all have successfully used JUnit in <br/>\n&gt; order<br/>\n&gt; to make GUI testing?<br/>\n&gt; If yes at which level have you ever did it (with JUnit)?
