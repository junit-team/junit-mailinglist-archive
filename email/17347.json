I have been<br/>\n&gt; using it for only one year now but in that short space of time you<br/>\n&gt; have all helped me not only to write better tests but to also be a<br/>\n&gt; better developer.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Now to my problem :-) I searched for a solution to this but all in<br/>\n&gt; vain. Essentially I want to execute a JUNIT test on a unix box<br/>\n&gt; remotely while connecting to the JVM using eclipse on my windows<br/>\n&gt; machine with the intention of debugging.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; How do I launch my JUNIT with a debug option on the command line? I<br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t want to use ANT. The problem I have is that we develop on<br/>\n&gt; windows but the application is designed to run solely on some<br/>\n&gt; different flavours of unix (mostly HP-UX). <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; All our tests run automatically at night after the daily build but<br/>\n&gt; sometimes the tests will fail on unix and pass on windows. Ideally,<br/>\n&gt; the solution would be to develop and test on unix but this is not<br/>\n&gt; permitted due certain limitations beyond my control.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Any help would be very much appreciated. <br/>\n&gt; regards,<br/>\n&gt; David.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; Yahoo!
