It might be necessary to write explicit tests of private methods in<br/>\nsuch a way as to invoke this code.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, if you are like me, and advocate a parallel and separate test<br/>\narchitecture (ala McGregor et. al.) for test classes, how has JUnitX worked<br/>\nfor you?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\nLauren<br/>\n<br/>\n=====<br/>\nLooking for an experienced Java/C++ Software Engineer?<br/>\nSee: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://developerdude.mystarband.net/resume.html\">http://developerdude.mystarband.net/resume.html</a></div>",
