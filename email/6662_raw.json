B. Rainsberger &lt;jbr@...&gt;&quot; &lt;jbr@...&gt;\n&gt; Subject: Re: Digest Number 739\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; A generator could put fail(); in any empty tests very easy.\n&gt; &gt; But there is a major downside too, especially for regenerating \n&gt; &gt; tools loke JUnitDoclet. I don&#39;t want to copy/paste half \n&gt; &gt; a page to this email, please see:\n&gt; &gt;   http://www.junitdoclet.org/faq.html#fail_not_default \n&gt; \n&gt; This is all definitely worth knowing, but my immediate guess is that \n&gt; the JUnitDoclet user is (re)generating far too many tests at once, \n&gt; irrespective of whether those tests say fail() or not.\n\nIf you mean, that in a non-TDD environment, there are many \nempty test methods in the beginning, that is true. (The next \nversion of JUnitDoclet will at least count them and print that\nnumber as warning.) But as a coach I actually have seen a \nremarkable thing: \n\n  Because it is so easy to write a test _then_ (once there is \n  a place for it) they get written naturally. Developers know \n  the importance of tests, the just need help to get started. \n   \nA generator is lowering that step, a regenerating tool is helping\nlater too. (Keeping the structure of the generated tests in \nsync with the application is very important, I believe. Refactoring \nis very important too, so the tools should provide help.) \n\nAn additional note on generating test skeletons: \nNot every test can be related to a specific unit of code. In \nmy experience, often there is a need for some functional \nTestCases too. This TestCases have to be coded manually.\n(I just wanted to say that, to prevent some of the usual \ncomments.)\n\n&gt; It is important for us to remember our TDD bias. :)\n\nBTW: Did you ever consider to generate a test from an empty \nbut compilable application method? Still the test can be \n_implemented_ before the tested method does something. \n \nRegards,\n\nSteffen Gemkow\n\n\n\n",
