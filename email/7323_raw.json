Not sure how you could close the connection at \n&gt; the end of the last test method executed, though. Has anyone used \n&gt; static variables to share fixture objects among multiple test methods?\n\nI did this very thing by accident - as I&#39;m new to JUnit testing.\n\nI have legacy DB code I have to test and the original author used a static anonymous class to\ncreate the connection cache.  I use setup() to instantiate the underlying class and get/close my\nDB connections in each test.  I pay the penalty for the connection creation in the first test, but\nevery other test is fairly fast.\n\n\nSo far, I&#39;ve found JUnits testing of each test method to be low level in design and nature...  I\ncreate a method in an object and my test methods exercise my method - checking for validity of\nexecution.  I&#39;ve found JUnit assumes I&#39;m interested in assuring the tested method executes and\nprovides some specific result.  \n\nMaybe I&#39;m still too new to JUnit to know what I&#39;m missing with SuiteRunner - but I&#39;ve always\nthought the first test I must *always* perform is the validation of my code against the\nspecifications - that what I&#39;m writing is performing to expectations.\n\nYour right, if I write code that modifies a part of my object in some way, I need to insure that I\nhaven&#39;t created an artifact that can damage some other part of the code.  Isn&#39;t that the basis of\nperforming lots of different asserts in each of your tests?  If I can alter some part of my object\nthru my code, then after my code runs, don&#39;t I want to verify the contents of the underlying\nobject?  All within one test? (Not Suite of tests - but an individual test...)\n\nIf I&#39;m too far off topic, please forgive me.\n\nBob\n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
