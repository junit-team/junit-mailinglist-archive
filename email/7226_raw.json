Agiletest differs from \nother mock object implementations in that it operates at the bytecode \nlevel. Other implementations are generally based on either \nstraightforward source-code generation, or the insertion of a dynamic \nproxy. The former approach increases the number of artefacts in your \ndevelopment project (which must also be kept in synchronisation with \ndevelopment) whilst the latter is limited to the mocking of \ninterfaces. The upshot is that, using AgileTest, it is possible to \ncreate mocks (or Imposters) of classes as well as interfaces, without \nrequiring source code for the class under test and without generating \na pile of additional source files. \n\nAgileTest also includes another neat feature - Interlopers - which \nallows for dynamic object substitution at any point in the class \nunder test, allowing for comprehensive mock-based testing of non \nparameterized object collaborations. This means that common \nprogramming idioms like static factory calls, or JNDI InitialContext \ncalls in EJBs, can now be successfully mocked. \n\n\n",
