Errors <br/>\nnormally point me toward unexpected couplings and dependencies whereas <br/>\nfailures tend not to. With an error my reaction is normally, &quot;Why the <br/>\nhell did *that* break?&quot; whereas with a failure, I normally have a pretty <br/>\ngood idea why the piece that broke is the piece that broke. Sometimes an <br/>\nerror indicates something that wasn&#39;t tested as well as it should have <br/>\nbeen, and shows me that I need to add another test case to cover it.<br/>\n<br/>\nSince I rarely get very far before running the test suite, it&#39;s rare <br/>\nthat I have multiple unrelated errors and failures. However, sometimes <br/>\none change does cause both, and I normally do look at the errors first. <br/>\nThey seem to more reliably point me at the bug.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n﻿Elliotte Rusty Harold  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:elharo@...\">elharo@...</a><br/>\nXML in a Nutshell 3rd Edition Just Published!<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.cafeconleche.org/books/xian3/\">http://www.cafeconleche.org/books/xian3/</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0596007647/cafeaulaitA/ref=nosim\">http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0596007647/cafeaulaitA/ref=nosim</a></div>",
