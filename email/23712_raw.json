In https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NUTCH-672, you\ngive=\r\n the example:\n\nlewis@lewis-01:~/ASF/branch-1.4/runtime/local$ export\nCLASSP=\r\nATH=3D$CLASSPATH:~/ASF/branch-1.4/src/test\nlewis@lewis-01:~/ASF/branch-1.4/=\r\nruntime/local$ echo $CLASSPATH\n:/home/lewis/ASF/branch-1.4/src/test\nlewis@l=\r\newis-01:~/ASF/branch-1.4/runtime/local$ bin/nutch junit\norg.apache.nutch.fe=\r\ntcher.TestFetcher\nClass not found &quot;org.apache.nutch.fetcher.TestFetcher&quot;\n\nT=\r\nhis appears to indicate that you are pointing CLASSPATH to a folder\nof sour=\r\nce files.  If that&#39;s true, you&#39;re likely to be happier if you\npoint CLASSPA=\r\nTH to a folder of .class files, or to a compiled .jar.\nGood luck,\n\n   David=\r\n\n\nOn Mon, Sep 26, 2011 at 3:48 PM, lewismc2 &lt;lewis.mcgibbney@...&gt; wro=\r\nte:\n&gt; Hi list,\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;m embarking on a pretty monumental JUnit test writing =\r\njourney as part of a larger vision of improving code integrity as well as e=\r\nxpanding our testing activities. Before I begin writing the tests I have be=\r\nen working (frustratingly) on this particular Jira issue [1]. In summary, t=\r\nhe issue attempts to add the functionality to a script [2] that will enable=\r\n us to test individual test cases from the command line rather than have to=\r\n run every JUnit test case when we wish to review changes or review perform=\r\nance of new test cases. I am however not getting very far with setting the =\r\ncorrect environment variable and could do with some guidance. The patch whi=\r\nch I&#39;m trying to apply would allow us to run\n&gt;\n&gt; bin/nutch junit org.apache=\r\n.nutch.testCase\n&gt;\n&gt; This would then run the specified test case class. I&#39;m =\r\npositive that my problem is the export classpath environment variable which=\r\n should point to the test case directory. I&#39;m just not able to add the clas=\r\ns =A0paths, therefore I get an exception and stack trace error (NoClassDef)=\r\n whenever I try to run a test case.\n&gt;\n&gt; Finally, just to clarify, I&#39;m using=\r\n the TestRunner class to run the tests.\n&gt;\n&gt; Any help, guidance etc would be=\r\n greatly appreciated as it will enable me to progress with writing and fixi=\r\nng some 20-30 test classes. If I can provide any more information please ad=\r\nvise.\n&gt;\n&gt; Thank you in advance\n&gt;\n&gt; Lewis\n&gt;\n&gt; [1] https://issues.apache.org/=\r\njira/browse/NUTCH-672\n&gt; [2] https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/nutch/trunk/sr=\r\nc/bin/nutch\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
