Any\n&gt; suggestions?\n\nWell, the first thing to suggest is that its no different from testing any\nother application (as Bob Koss points out). To expand on that, the thing\nwhich makes an application is just its main method. Everything else is\njust a collection of objects and classes which can be unit tested.\nSimilarly, what makes an applet an applet is just the fact that you have\nan Applet implementation which ties all the rest of your classes together\ninto a working whole. The rest is just objects and classes which you can\neasily test.\n\nIt is relatively straight forward to write an applet in such a way that\nyou can actually run it either as an applet or standalone. You do that by\nseparating all of the function of the applet into other classes which are\nsimply delegated to by a very thin Applet implementation. Even your main\nPanel can be separated out easily. You can then instantiate that Panel\neither inside the Applet or inside a Frame created from your application.\nIf your applet runs in its own Frame, this is even easier. This type of\nmodularization will also make the code much easier to unit test.\n\nYou don&#39;t, therefore, need to run your unit tests in a web browser. They\nare run standalone from one of the junit testrunners, just like with\neverything else. You can change security settings around testcases to\nsimulate the default restrictions of a browser. It *is* possible to\nautomate testing of applets running in browsers for purposes of\nportability testing, for instance, but this is non-trivial and should be\navoided unless/until really necessary. (It&#39;s really functional testing,\nnot unit testing)\n\n[Aside: Has anyone thought about creating an Applet based TestRunner? This\nwould make it significantly easier for folks (like us) that do portability\ntesting across a gagillion VMs. When I did some of this sort of work for\nIBM (Orion/On Demand Server), we had to write the browser based test\nautomation pretty much from scratch and it was not fun to get it to run in\nthe various browser targets. Changes in the security API and better\nconformance since then plus the very modular nature of junit should make\nit *almost* trivial now. Is anyone else interested?]\n\n-- \nEric Vought\nChief Technical Officer - QLUE Consulting, Inc.\n\nevought@... toll-free: 888-771-3538  RTP area: 919-816-9901\n\n\n\n\n",
