    "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-532975796\">A problem with your terms. A &quot;coverage measure&quot; is a measure -- it does not cover anything.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are different kinds of test coverage, measured by the aspects of the program they cover. 100% line coverage seems to be the most definite of the ones you list, although it does not take into account different data sets. It is possible to have 100% line coverage and still have a defect because you have not written code to handle a particular case.<br/>\n<br/>\nI do not like test coverage measurement. It is not smart enough. Obviously, 90% coverage is much better than 50% coverage, but the return on investment goes down considerably up over 90%. My opinion.<br/>\n<br/>\nTake care.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;So said javainsel on 2003-05-04 --------------------<br/>\n&gt;I read about Line Coverage, Branch Coverage, Condition Coverage, <br/>\n&gt;Path Coverage, Call Coverage, Loop Coverage, Linear Code Sequence <br/>\n&gt;and Jump (LCAJ) Coverage and Data Flow Coverage. And also I read <br/>\n&gt;something about Data Chains (same as Data Flow?).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Is there a coverage measure which covers 100%?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;And is there a ranking of coverage measures in terms of how much <br/>\n&gt;they cover compared to the other measures?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Yahoo!
