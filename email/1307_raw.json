This gives the inner class full access to the outer\n&gt; class&#39;s private methods and members, while allowing the inner\n&gt; class to be an\n&gt; instance of a JUnit test case.  I sent an example of this to\n&gt; this list a few\n&gt; weeks ago.  Another handy thing is that when you compile the\n&gt; outer class,\n&gt; the inner test case is produced in a separate class file\n&gt; which can be safely\n&gt; deleted when packaging the outer class for production\n&gt; (because the outer\n&gt; class makes no references to the static inner class).\n\nI have recently used a similar technique for legacy code I wanted to test\nbut had no chance to refactor. Because my tests reside in their own packages\nand I didn&#39;t want to break this pattern, I decided to implement a test\ninterface as an inner class:\n\npublic class ClassToTest {\n  private void methodToTest() {\n    ...\n  }\n\n  public class TestInterface {\n    public void testMethod() {\n      methodToTest();\n    }\n}\n\nThis way I can call the private method via\n\n(instanceToTest.new TestInterface()).testMethod();\n\nI have to admit that this code is somewhat ugly, but I am happy with this -\nafter all I think it *is* a code smell... ;-)\n\nciao, Ilja\n\n\n",
