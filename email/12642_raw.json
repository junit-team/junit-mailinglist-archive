There was one thread that seemed \nto be in the right vein, but didn&#39;t actually have an answer.\n\n=============\n\nFinally - my question:\n\nIs there an automated way to output the summary data (#tests, \n#errors, #failures) from my JUnit Report to an external file \n(possibly xls, or a file accessible by spreadsheet) in order to \nmaintain a history of our results?\n\nIn the ideal world, there would never be any errors or failures, but \nthe point of the testing is to make us confident in making code \nchanges.  We run a nightlybuild regression, so the next morning I \ncan see if I missed anything (sometimes the failures are well \nremoved from the actual class that was changed).\n\nSo, we would like to be able to record historical data of the \nfluctuations.  In the past, manually, we have found that the \nerrors/failures go up when we get above a certain velocity.\n\nThanks for any insight that can be provided.\n\nDianne Doss\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
