The developers add methods to these classes continuously. All <br/>\ntest classes are combined in a testsuite, which runs with <br/>\njunit.textui.TestRunner in a batch script.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I would need to see in the output of that script is the name of <br/>\neach test method which was executed. I want to avoid, that each method <br/>\nshould printout its name, but solve it automatically.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat could I do here?<br/>\n<br/>\nAlex</div>",
