I planned to delegate the\n&gt; running completely to other frameworks and just be flexible about what they\n&gt; can report back. So it becomes more of a presentation-issue (it seems to me\n&gt; that you are also focusing on running the tests, especially being clever\n&gt; about ordering the run sequence for high probability of catching failing\n&gt; tests fast).\n\nYes, I&#39;m focusing on running the tests. From a testing framework&#39;s point \nof view, Jumi provides a similar interface as JUnit&#39;s @RunWith \nannotation and the related APIs.\n\nJumi will also include things such as test discovery and starting up the \nJVM instance, which previously have been taken care of build tools and \nIDEs. There will also be a graphical UI, so that it would be usable even \nwithout IDE integration. My goal is to solve some cross-cutting concerns \nwhich affect the full tool chain of running tests. It will also try to \nminimize the small differences between running tests in a build tool vs \nIDE, and protect from the effects of bugs in IDEs&#39; support for running \ntests (I&#39;ve encountered many such issues).\n\n&gt; It also looks very promising with focus on performance. Have you looked into\n&gt; incremental running al� SBT or is that left to tools like SBT?\n\nI know about SBT&#39;s incremental compiler. Does it also do something smart \nrelated running tests?\n\nSBT and FSC were my inspirations for class loader caching: Jumi will use \na separate class loader for library JARs and cache it, so that when \nrunning tests there would not be the overhead of loading a large \nlibrary&#39;s classes (for example on my C2Q6600 it takes over 200ms to load \nGuice the first time). With Java 6 and before, class loading is single \nthreaded (Java 7 will have parallel classloading), so that has been a \nbottleneck for running tests in parallel.\n\nJUnit Max&#39;s way of reordering tests, so that those which fail the most \nlikely are run first, is also one thing that I&#39;ll include. I have a \nhabit of waiting for the tests to finish executing before typing more, \nso the UI will also give some feedback about when the \nmost-likely-to-fail tests have been run, so that I could resume typing \nfaster. And running tests in parallel is of course a must - finally some \nuse for my 4 CPU cores. :)\n\nThe above optimizations are especially aimed for speeding up test suites \nwhich run in a matter of seconds. If it takes 3 seconds to run all \ntests, a speedup of 0.5 seconds is big.\n\nI&#39;ll also provide something for big companies which are full of mediocre \ndevelopers writing slow tests. Running tests in a cluster is outside the \nscope of Jumi&#39;s core functionality, but I&#39;ll create a commercial plugin \nfor that. (Who wouldn&#39;t want to get a living from writing open source? \n;) I&#39;m not sure how much running tests in a cluster would speed up \nalready fast test suites, because of network latency, but I&#39;ll try and \nsee what I can do about it.\n\n-- \nEsko Luontola\nwww.orfjackal.net\n\n",
