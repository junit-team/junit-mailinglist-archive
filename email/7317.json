By  using  a  common  base<br/>\n&gt;    TestCase,<br/>\n&gt;    I could set up the TLS easily enough without overburdening the unit<br/>\n&gt;    tests, I think.<br/>\n&gt;    David<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I think was you are sensing is a &quot;code smell.&quot;  I don&#39;t have an opinion<br/>\nabout the TLS you mentioned but I would suggest using this &quot;pain&quot; to<br/>\nforce yourself to refactor some more.  For instance, you could use<br/>\nFactories, Delegators|Facades, or Proxies instead polluting your API with<br/>\nunneeded args.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne really good question to ask yourself is &quot;Who can I get to do &#39;this&#39;<br/>\nfor me?&quot; as opposed to &quot;How could I do &#39;this&#39;?&quot;  It&#39;s a subtle, but<br/>\nprofound, difference.  It pushes the issue off as far as possible of what<br/>\nobject will answer &#39;this&#39; question or provide &#39;this&#39; behavior.<br/>\n<br/>\nYour test (via TDD) is saying, &quot;I want XYZ to do ABC for me.  What will<br/>\nit need to do that?  InterfaceA, InterfaceB, InterfaceC... Ok -- I will<br/>\ngive those things to it.&quot;  In some cases, that may be the thing to do, in<br/>\nothers however it makes more sense for the object you are testing to have<br/>\nthose things implicitly available -- your situation sounds a lot like the<br/>\nlatter.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope that helps.<br/>\n=jason<br/>\n=jason<br/>\n[:question | ^One]</div>",
