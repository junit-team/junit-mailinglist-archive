At times I asked myself, =\r\nif I was right \n&gt; when many gurus here were arguing against my opinion.

Maybe you are=\r\n interested in \n&gt; what he has to say in favor of Contract-Driven Developmen=\r\nt. I like \n&gt; the idea of Design by Contract. And I think that it could make=\r\n \n&gt; traditional JUnit tests obsolete, since the test cases could \n&gt; automat=\r\nically be generated from the Contracts. I think this is what \n&gt; Parasoft JT=\r\nest already does.\n&gt; \n&gt; Don&#39;t misunderstand me. I like JUnit. But I always l=\r\nook for better \n&gt; ways to solve my problems.
