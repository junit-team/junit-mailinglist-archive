So, framework should provide some way to\n&gt;&gt;supply test data lazily.\n&gt;&gt;=\r\n\n&gt;&gt;From other hand if you think of IDE it should be possible to run\n&gt;&gt;just =\r\nspecific test or only selected test cases. o, it seems that there\n&gt;&gt;should =\r\nbe some random-acess API, which iteterator just does not provide.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;Also=\r\n note that one would be interested to know how many test cases\n&gt;&gt;in the giv=\r\nen data provider as well as a readable name for each test.\n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;I exc=\r\nhanged a few emails with JB about that, and my take on &quot;data names&quot; is\n&gt;bas=\r\nically: I don&#39;t see the need.\n&gt;\n&gt;If a test method being fed by a data provi=\r\nder fails, it will clearly say\n&gt;something like &quot;Expected 42 but got 41&quot;. Fr=\r\nom that point, it&#39;s pretty easy\n&gt;to trace which data from the data set caus=\r\ned this error and act on it.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n  That is exacly the case I&#39;m talking ab=\r\nout. In more or less complicated \nexample test data may include number of i=\r\nnput parameters and failed \nexpectation on primitive value (such as numeric=\r\n os string assertion) is \ncompletely unrelated to these parameters. Moreove=\r\nr it is quite possible \nthat you&#39;d have a side effect and test is failing o=\r\nn some other reason \n(like internally swallowed runtime exception or someth=\r\ning similary weird).\n\n&gt;Actually, I would probably not even care about that =\r\nmyself: I would rerun my\n&gt;tests, put a breakpoint on any assertion thrown a=\r\nnd let the IDE show me\n&gt;exactly where and when the test fails. Whether this=\r\n test method was fed data\n&gt;from a DataProvider or from somewhere else is ir=\r\nrelevant to fix the test.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n  Don&#39;t you think it would be a mistake to =\r\ntell the users how they \nshould work? :-)\n  Besides, if the test failed on =\r\nbuild or continuous integratino server \nyou would have to rerun test locall=\r\ny with your breakpoint, which would \nbe quite waste of time in my opinion, =\r\nbecause you should know that is \nfailed from the report.\n\n  Another quite p=\r\nractical use case for test names is that they can be \npotentially used to g=\r\net better understanding what part of the \nfunctionality is broken. Especial=\r\nly if this feature is used for some \nintegration-level regression tests tha=\r\nt may potentially cover wide range \nof functionality.\n\n  regards,\n  Eugene\n=\r\n\n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n",
