The development team has created test cases for each object,\nbut has hardcoded parameters into each test case.  The actual objects\nessentially take a hash as a parameter specific to that object as\ninstructions for what to do.  \n\nMy problem is this.  Before development moves along much further, I\nwould like to take the test harnesses for each object and remove the\nhardcoding from them.  Each test harness should still be able to be\nrun individually as it&#39;s own test, but I&#39;m looking to the future as\nwell, when we have the potential to do nightly builds and will want to\nrun all of the test harnesses as a suite together.  This definitely\ncannot happen if any hardcoding exists, but there needs to be some\nexternal way to pass each object the information specific to it only\nto test.  I don&#39;t want to create a properties/configuration file for\neach object, as many of of the objects can re-use the same sdf file,\nlogger, and other config files.  \n\nAny suggestions?\n\nThanks,\nAllen Reinmeyer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
