If <br/>\nyou want to see something more than just dots ..........F.....F.... <br/>\nlike behaviour - if that is what your question is - I would recommend <br/>\nto extend the TestRunner class and use it. Serach through this class <br/>\nto see which method you would like to override to get the output the <br/>\nway you want. I dont want to give a complete solution and you may use <br/>\nyour own judgement to decide what is best suited for you.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Nilesh<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In junit@y..., Eric Vought &lt;evought@q...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; You can also add logging to your code. We have a testcase which<br/>\n&gt; automatically collects and organizes the log output from the<br/>\n&gt; class-under-test. You can just tail the log file or add some<br/>\n&gt; code to the GUI testrunner to display it. Apache/Jakarta has a nice<br/>\n&gt; logging system. We also have our own package <br/>\n(http://qcijutils.qlue.com)<br/>\n&gt; whcih includes a LoggerTestCase base class. If you use our package,<br/>\n&gt; check out the latest source.
