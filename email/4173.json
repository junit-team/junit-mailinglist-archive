For <br/>\n&gt; &#39;public&#39; and &#39;protected&#39; methods, I&#39;ll attempt first to make <br/>\n&gt; the method cohesive and give it a signature that&#39;s as <br/>\n&gt; expressive as possible .  If the signature still isn&#39;t <br/>\n&gt; completely obvious as to the intent of the method, or there&#39;s <br/>\n&gt; something particularly interesting about the method behavior, <br/>\n&gt; then I&#39;ll add JavaDoc.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I agree - But I try and javadoc all public as its the company coding style..<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 2. Tests do show intention of the method, just the <br/>\n&gt; implementation (we&#39;re<br/>\n&gt; &gt; back to the &quot;the implementation is not the design argument&quot;).<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Rather, they show the intention, and _not_  the implementation.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Is that what you meant to say?<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n </span></blockquote>What I meant to say was:<br/>\n2. Tests do *not* show intention of the method, just the *current*<br/>\nimplementation.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat is, if the tests document the method, what they are documenting is the<br/>\ncurrent implementation of that method, not the intention.<br/>\nThen it follows that order to find and fix a bug, you must admit the<br/>\n&quot;documentation&quot; is incorrect, not the implementation.<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess that it depends on how much design you wish to express in the<br/>\ndocumentation? If you just want to express the implementation than we are<br/>\njust pushing the gap between documentation/implementation back up to the<br/>\ndesign/implementation division.<br/>\n<br/>\nokay .. getting a bit deep here - back to hacking away with vi ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\ncheers<br/>\njoe<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThis e-mail and any attachment is for authorised use by the intended recipient(s) only.
