It means \n&gt; that there may be areas where an object needing to be mocked has taken \n&gt; too much control in the system.  I can&#39;t speak to your system of \n&gt; course, but here&#39;s something I see regularly:\n\nIf you mean lots of mocks with complicated set up, then I agree there&#39;s \na problem, but there are other ways to look at it.\n\n&gt; Say we have a method that takes a BigObject and does something with a \n&gt; subset of the data in that object:\n&gt; \n&gt;     public void doSomething(BigObject o) {\n&gt;        String s = o.getStringValue();\n&gt;        int i = o.getIntValue();\n&gt;        // do something with &#39;s&#39; and &#39;i&#39;\n&gt;     }\n&gt; \n&gt; There are several other methods like doSomething() in the system, so \n&gt; the initial reaction is to mock BigObject so that we can pass it into \n&gt; doSomething() and the other methods.  BigObject has a lot of setup \n&gt; involved to put it into a test state, but with some effort we can \n&gt; create a MockBigObject.\n\nThe problem here is not the mocking of BigObject, but the complex setup \nthat requires, because it&#39;s doing too much work or is too tightly \ncoupled, or something. What if BigObject were an interface which would \nmake mocking up trivial?\n\n&gt; But the doSomething() method is really trying to tell us that it \n&gt; doesn&#39;t want a BigObject.  It just wants a String and an int:\n&gt; \n&gt;     public void doSomething(String s, int i) {\n&gt;        // do something with &#39;s&#39; and &#39;i&#39;\n&gt;     }\n&gt; \n&gt; OK, now we only have to initialize a String and an int to pass into \n&gt; doSomething() during the test.  Can we do the same thing with other \n&gt; methods that take a BigObject?  Or do those methods share the need for \n&gt; a subset of data we can package in a SmallerObject?\n\nExtracting subtypes is exactly the right thing to do, normally I&#39;d \nprefer to do this with an interface. I have doubts about unpacking \nindividual fields because that&#39;s a loss of information. The type system \nno longer tells us about the relationships between whatever the string \nand int represent, and I find myself increasingly distrusting the use of \nbasic types in Java.\n\nAgain, once you have an interface, mocking becomes trivial.\n\n&gt; I would suggest mocking as a last resort as often times it&#39;s a band-aid \n &gt; for what the system really wants. I find that if I reach for mocking\n &gt; first, then I miss those design opportunities.\n\nThat makes sense to me only if you&#39;re talking about mocking unpleasant \nexisting featuers. On the other hand, struggling to do so often \nhighlights the dependencies you need to untangle.\n\nS\n\n",
