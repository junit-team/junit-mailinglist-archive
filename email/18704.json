But then, I<br/>\nwonder if this is much better than<br/>\n<br/>\n@Test public void pythagoreanDistance() {<br/>\n  assertEquals(5.0, new Point(0.0).distanceTo(new Point 3,4));<br/>\n}<br/>\n<br/>\nAs I see it, the advantages of generation from comments, as you&#39;re<br/>\nproposing are:<br/>\nG1) The validation code sits close to the implementation code, making<br/>\nit easier to look at both and reason about them<br/>\nG2) Specific behavior examples can sit next to general statements<br/>\nabout correct behavior, with the same syntax<br/>\nG3) A custom domain-specific language can reduce typing.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe advantages of the JUnit approach are:<br/>\nJ1) Java is actually usually a pretty good language for describing the<br/>\nbehavior of Java programs (this is not entirely tongue-in-cheek.  For<br/>\nexample, bash is a rather poor language with which to describe the<br/>\nbehavior of shell scripts)<br/>\nJ2) When it&#39;s hard to write Java to validate my implementation code,<br/>\nsometimes that means my code has a bad design.<br/>\nJ3) Not having to learn a custom domain-specific language reduces cognitive load<br/>\n<br/>\nI currently believe that it&#39;s easier to improve tooling around a<br/>\nJUnit-like framework to get the advantages of code generation than<br/>\nvice-versa.  I think that G1, looking at tests and implementation<br/>\nsimultaneously, is something that IDE&#39;s can still improve upon<br/>\ntremendously when using JUnit.  Ideally, when a test failed, I would<br/>\nautomatically be able to see the failure log, the test, and the<br/>\nimplementation code in side-by-side windows.  My Theories work is<br/>\ndesigned to bring the G2 advantages to people using JUnit, allowing<br/>\ngeneral statements to be written and evaluated in a JUnit style.  As<br/>\nto G3, I&#39;ve yet to see a domain-specific language (DSL) for tests that<br/>\nreally excites me*, but I believe that someday I might.<br/>\n<br/>\nNone of this touches on the idea of generating characterization tests,<br/>\nas with junitfactory.  What I&#39;m getting at is the best way for a<br/>\ndeveloper to write down what the implementation code should do, to get<br/>\nautomated support for verifying that it does.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\n<br/>\n   David Saff<br/>\n<br/>\n* (esoteric side comment) especially since I&#39;m a firm believer that<br/>\nevery external DSL maintained long enough eventually becomes a poorly<br/>\nimplemented general-purpose OO language.
