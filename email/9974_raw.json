Each invocation of runTest() occurs\n&gt; in its own instance of TestCase.\n&gt;\n\n\nThen my guess was wrong.  :-)\n\n\n&gt;&gt; At any rate, it\n&gt;&gt; seems to be reaching fairly deep in the trick bag and I&#39;m wondering\n&gt;&gt; what I&#39;m missing with the obvious approach.\n&gt;\n&gt; I avoid this constructor:\n&gt;\n&gt;        public CalculateAgeTest(String testName, int expectedAge,\n&gt;                Date futureDate) {\n&gt;\n&gt;            super(&quot;testCalculateAge&quot;);   &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;\n&gt;            this.expectedAge = expectedAge;\n&gt;            this.futureDate = futureDate;\n&gt;        }\n&gt;\n&gt; Also with the &quot;obvious&quot; approach, I can&#39;t tell one test from another:\n&gt; all the test names look the same. Which one failed?\n\n\nThe one that fails with &quot;expected 10 but was 20&quot;?\n\n\n&gt; By making the test name different from the test method name, I can use\n&gt; the test name to report specifically which line of data led to a \n&gt; failing\n&gt; test.\n\nUnderstood.\n\nI agree that this solution works well when you want to externalize the \ndata for a data-driven solution.  I guess externalizing data is my last \nresort.  I start with individual test case methods with common code \nrefactored into a custom assertion.  I start there partly because it&#39;s \neasier for me to see the data and the assertion side by side in a test \nmethod.  And I name the test methods according to why the specific \npiece of data is important to test.  So if a test fails, I know by \nlooking at the method name what went wrong.\n\nRarely do I find that I have enough permutations of data to justify \nexternalizing the data.  But when that does happen, I externalize it.  \nEven in that case I don&#39;t use a parameterized test case.\n\nI&#39;ve seen the parameterized test case used.  I&#39;ve never had occasion to \nuse it myself.  Perhaps it&#39;s my testing style.  I&#39;m using this as an \nopportunity to question why I don&#39;t use parameterized test case, not as \nan opportunity to caution you not to use it.\n\nMike \n    \n\n\n",
