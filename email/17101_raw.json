The\n&gt; &gt; constructor of each test instance is called just before @Before.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; So my question - is this a designed behaviour? Can I assume that  \n&gt; junit 4 runners will have\n&gt; &gt; this behaviour, allowing me to use the constructor instead of  \n&gt; @Before, allowing fields to\n&gt; &gt; be final, etc?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Yes, this is designed behavior (as is, in your second message,  \n&gt; releasing\n&gt; each test object for potential garbage collection after the test\n&gt; completes). You can trust the runners that ship with JUnit 4 to\n&gt; preserve it. If you invoke a custom runner, you&#39;re currently at the\n&gt; mercy of that runner&#39;s writer.\n&gt;\n&gt; In my own code, I use constructors in JUnit 4 tests, unless I&#39;m doing\n&gt; something that I want to be visually matched with a particular @After.\n\nExcellent, thank you.\n\nIt wasn&#39;t something that I had seen mentioned in the JUnit 4 write- \nups, and for our suite of 700-odd tests, many of which are functional  \ntests which fire up the GUI, talk to the database, play media with  \nQuickTime etc, it should increase stability significantly.\n\nJust waiting now for a decent ant task...;-)\n\nDuncan\n\n\n",
