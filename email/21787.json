The system under test is then configured to<br/>\nconnect back to the stub service in the test, and the test can prime<br/>\nit with responses to drive the test scenario.<br/>\n<br/>\nI usually write some builder classes to create those responses, to<br/>\nshield the tests from the on-the-wire format used by the third party<br/>\nservice.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut I also test against responses captured from the real service to<br/>\nmake sure that the stub service and builders aren&#39;t giving me a false<br/>\nsense of security.<br/>\n<br/>\nFinally, I&#39;ll plan some integration testing against the service using<br/>\nan environment or account that is provided by the third party for<br/>\ntesting.  I try to get that integration testing started as early as<br/>\npossible (during development, not in a final testing phase) so that<br/>\nthere&#39;s as much time as possible to deal with any misunderstandings<br/>\nand defects it raises.<br/>\n<br/>\n--Nat<br/>\n<br/>\n2009/6/29 angeshwar &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:angeshwar@...\">angeshwar@...</a>&gt;:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hi,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I have a client server application. The client connects with a remote server<br/>\n&gt; (3rd party) and sends/receives different kinds of messages.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; For my Junit test cases I am implementing my own server which simulates the<br/>\n&gt; behavior of the 3rd party server.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Whats the best approach to test this.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; - Where do I include the code that actually launches my local test server<br/>\n&gt; (should this part of Junit test package)<br/>\n&gt; - For each message type (exchanged b/w client and my test server) that I<br/>\n&gt; will be testing, do I kick start / shut down the server (seperately for each<br/>\n&gt; test case)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>-- <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.natpryce.com\">http://www.natpryce.com</a></div>",
