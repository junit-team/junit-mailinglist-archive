I&#39;m in the<br/>\nunfortunate situation of having to write tests for an existing<br/>\napplication(I haven&#39;t been involved in the development). <br/>\n<br/>\nI found tons of information about test-driven development and<br/>\ntest-first, but hardly anything about writing tests after the<br/>\napplication has been developed. Any experiences? <br/>\n<br/>\nIt still isn&#39;t determined yet on which level the tests should take<br/>\nplace. &quot;Real unit-tests&quot; (&quot;test everything that could possibly break&quot;)<br/>\nwould be too much work for the given time(~6 weeks), I guess. So it<br/>\nmight be more something like acceptance tests. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe SUT is a middleware-API running on an application server, using<br/>\nwebservices and RMI to get and set customer data from several remote<br/>\ndatabases (lots of getters for about 10mio customers). =&gt; no user<br/>\ninterface/gui etc. <br/>\n<br/>\nSince we still have to exactly figure out what we want to test, I<br/>\nwould appreciate some information about whether or not JUnit is the<br/>\nright choice in general (alternatives?) and some advices for my &quot;test<br/>\nlast&quot; approach. <br/>\n<br/>\nThanks in advance,<br/>\nThomas</div>",
