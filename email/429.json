Write a mock (or stub) File class that can be setup to simulate system<br/>\n&gt; &gt; failures. This one sounds like too much effort, especially since File is<br/>\n&gt; &gt; not an interface. Also this approach only tests the system style failure<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and not the jvm failure.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;It&#39;s not easy to provide a sensible stub for the File class since File is<br/>\n&gt;only an encapsulation of the file name. You have to write stub streams as<br/>\n&gt;well which do the real input/output stuff.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You are absolutely correct - in my zeal to simplify (and in my early <br/>\nmorning caffeine-free haze) I replaced references to our internal class <br/>\nXmlFile with File and it lost a lot in the translation !<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;My suggestion would be to<br/>\n&gt;introduce an interface which covers only your special requirements, e.g.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;public interface MyFile {<br/>\n&gt;     PrintWriter getWriter();<br/>\n&gt;     BufferedReader getReader();<br/>\n&gt;     boolean exists();<br/>\n&gt;}<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;That way you can easily introduce a mock implementation which provides you<br/>\n&gt;with the mock writer and reader instances.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>That was my thought exactly.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;However, it might not be worth the effort.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Ditto.<br/>\n<br/>\nRobert</div>",
