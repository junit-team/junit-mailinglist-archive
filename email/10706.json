The problem I have is on the first failure, the tests <br/>\ndiscontinues and the rest of the array is not checked.  This makes <br/>\nsense because of the exception that is thrown and handled by JUNIT.  <br/>\nIs there a away I can keep the loop running until it finishes all the <br/>\nstrings.  I can catch the exception but how do I add it to the <br/>\ncurrent aggregate test results that JUNIT is keeping track of.  Also, <br/>\nis this the best way or proper way to do this?  I don&#39;t think it <br/>\nmakes very much sense to write a test method for each string in the <br/>\narry, it wouldn&#39;t be very scalable or dynamic.  Thanks in advance for <br/>\nany help or advice.  <br/>\n<br/>\nKent</div>",
