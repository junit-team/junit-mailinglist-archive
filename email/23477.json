There are quite many different reasons for having a<br/>\n&gt; skipped/ignored/pending test, and also with some testing frameworks they<br/>\n&gt; are marked pending during the execution of the test (e.g. ScalaTest&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; pendingUntilFixed) whereas some mark them before executing any test code<br/>\n&gt; (e.g. JUnit&#39;s @Ignore).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I think this is where my idea was different. I planned to delegate the<br/>\nrunning completely to other frameworks and just be flexible about what they<br/>\ncan report back. So it becomes more of a presentation-issue (it seems to me<br/>\nthat you are also focusing on running the tests, especially being clever<br/>\nabout ordering the run sequence for high probability of catching failing<br/>\ntests fast).<br/>\nBeing the requester for pending until fixed in scalatest I often miss the<br/>\nexplicit pending in test-frameworks. The inspiration here is rspec. As you<br/>\nsay, the difference between pending in this sense and just ignoring is that<br/>\npending tests are run anyway but failures do not give a &quot;red bar&quot; since they<br/>\nare expected, it works well for &quot;mockless to down&quot; where you can flesh out<br/>\ntests from the top and pend until you can get something working. Once one of<br/>\nyour initial tests work they change status from pending to fixed (or in<br/>\nscalatest, fail because a successful test is marked as pending)<br/>\n<br/>\nIt also looks very promising with focus on performance. Have you looked into<br/>\nincremental running al� SBT or is that left to tools like SBT?<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m watching your repo now, got a bit tempted to support Jumi in poju4s (but<br/>\nfirst change the name of that project).<br/>\n<br/>\n/J<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; --<br/>\n&gt; Esko Luontola<br/>\n&gt; www.orfjackal.net<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",
