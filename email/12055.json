I have downloaded a<br/>\nfew smaller ones and will take on a few larger ones later (my modem<br/>\nconnection is a little slow for everything  beyond 2MB or so). As soon<br/>\nas possible - but that may take some time - I&#39;ll build and test and<br/>\ncover them :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks also for the general remarks on coverage - I have had some<br/>\nexperience with this myself long ago, when I wrote a coverage<br/>\nprecompiler - source level - for C++ about 10 years ago and forced a<br/>\nmedium-sized project to go to 100% branch coverage. I also read Brian<br/>\nMarick&#39;s book and a few of his articles back then. My raw gut feeling is<br/>\nthat there is more to code coverage than an arbitrary number (&quot;85%&quot;; or<br/>\n&quot;current level is 37%&quot;) and/or Marick&#39;s concept of &quot;manual hot spot<br/>\ndetection&quot; (if I remember it correctly; which is important!) and/or<br/>\nimpossible goals (the claim - also still mine - &quot;only 100% feasible(!? -<br/>\nhow to determine?) is ok&quot;) and/or statistics showing how much/how little<br/>\ncorrelation there is between some sort and level of code coverage and<br/>\nfunctional correctness (does anyone know recent research/pracitcal<br/>\nexperience of such statistics - i.e., what is [some specific] coverage<br/>\n&quot;worth&quot; on the &quot;TCO curve of quality&quot;, so-to-speak?). <br/>\n<br/>\nWorking in real teams with real time-pressure and real chaos and real<br/>\nerrors (also mine - I&#39;m oftentimes a lazy guy who falls for &quot;code first<br/>\nand then dont test&quot; the first moment I get under pressure ...), I&#39;m<br/>\nstill (or again - after those 10 years) looking for the place where XP<br/>\nand TDD concepts on the one hand; and code coverage on the other fall in<br/>\nsync ... I also have a rough idea, but it&#39;s too early to talk about it -<br/>\nI&#39;ll first try it out on my unsuspecting team ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nRegards<br/>\nHarald</div>",
