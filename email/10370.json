Each<br/>\n&gt; suite should contain all tests of its package and all suites of the<br/>\n&gt; direct subpackages. Furthermore it should be able to update the<br/>\n&gt; relevant suites, if anywhere a new test was added.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I seek for such a tool, because i am going to intigrate TestCases one<br/>\n&gt; by one to an existing large project. For now only a few tests exist,<br/>\n&gt; but they are spread over all the packages. To be able to execute these<br/>\n&gt; tests i want a root-suite which contains all existing tests. But i<br/>\n&gt; don´t want to write suites for each package by hand.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>When you say &quot;write suites&quot;, what do you mean? What specifically do you <br/>\nexpect such a tool to do? It sounds like you want something to collect a <br/>\nnumber of test case classes together to execute as a single suite.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnt (http://ant.apache.org) already helps collect all the TestCase <br/>\nclasses from a certain part of the file system (matching by filename <br/>\npatterns) and execute them as a large test suite. Look at its <br/>\n&lt;batchtest&gt; task.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, look at JUnit-addons&#39; DirectorySuiteBuilder, which you can start <br/>\nusing more quickly than Ant, but which /only/ does what the Ant <br/>\n&lt;batchtest&gt; task does.<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJ.
