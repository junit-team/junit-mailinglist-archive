I then had test case filters that collects all tests that <br/>\nimplemented a given interface, like DatabaseTest, AcceptanceTest, <br/>\nPerformanceTest, and so on. After about 3 months, I noticed that I <br/>\nwasn&#39;t running the &quot;Database&quot; tests, and that only a handful of test <br/>\ncase classes implemented more than one interface. I also noticed that I <br/>\nwas running all the tests most of the time, anyway.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt;  &gt; Tests sometimes naturally divide themselves along the axis of &quot;how<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; often we run them&quot;.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; That&#39;s certainly *one* aspect of how they divide themselves. However,<br/>\n&gt; there&#39;s more than that.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &lt;snip&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I separate production source from test source, but currently all our<br/>\n&gt; test cases are in one tree (per project).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The main problem I see with your solution (other than it not keeping<br/>\n&gt; all the tests for one class in a single easily findable place) is that<br/>\n&gt; it only works while you&#39;ve only got one axis you want to divide the<br/>\n&gt; tests up by. Another axis which is relevant for us is which area of<br/>\n&gt; functionality is involved - and that may not always be feasible on a<br/>\n&gt; package/namespace basis. For instance, if all db-schema-sensitive<br/>\n&gt; tests are categorised as such, then after making a schema change I can<br/>\n&gt; run all those tests, whether they&#39;re also performance tests or not.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Why can&#39;t you run all the /unit/ tests before a check-in? Don&#39;t they <br/>\nmostly all run in memory, anyway?<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, since database-related tests are usually slower than tests that <br/>\nrun entirely in memory, is there /really/ a big difference in execution <br/>\ntime between running all the database-related tests and running /all/ <br/>\nthe tests. In my experience, the difference is usually measured in tens <br/>\nof seconds, and not tens of minutes. After all, 1000 in-memory tests <br/>\nusually run in 10-30 seconds. What&#39;s 10-30 seconds more, compared to a <br/>\ntest run that takes 20-30 minutes? For that matter, what&#39;s 1-2 minutes <br/>\nmore? Why not just run all the tests, rather than spend the extra time <br/>\ncategorizing them just so?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">  &gt; In<br/>\n &gt; the situation where running *all* unit tests just isn&#39;t feasible<br/>\n &gt; before every check-in, being easily able to choose which tests are run<br/>\n &gt; (across both NUnit and JUnit, by the way) to verify that nothing&#39;s<br/>\n &gt; been broken requires more flexibility than a single axis would<br/>\n &gt; provide.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>In a configuration that complex, I would probably not have enough <br/>\nconfidence to ship code without running every single test. If the system <br/>\nis really that big, and test runs take hours, then I would immediately <br/>\nevaluate the benefits of splitting that system into loosely coupled <br/>\nparts and evolving them in separate source trees. My hunch is that the <br/>\nresult would be easier to manage and would have much faster tests, on <br/>\nthe whole.<br/>\n<br/>\nDo bear in mind how much I&#39;m speculating. It&#39;s possible that you&#39;ve <br/>\nalready considered all this and rejected it; but I&#39;ve simply never found <br/>\nmyself in such a situation, so I&#39;m imagining how I would deal with that <br/>\nsituation if I found myself in it.<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJ.
