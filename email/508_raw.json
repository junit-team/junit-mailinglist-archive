I have been using JBuilder 4 and have only successfully been able to\nhit break points in the main method (which just ends up taking you to\nunderlying JUnit code).  In debugging I would like to be able to step\nthrough the individual tests and step into the actual class that is being\ntested to see what is going on.\n\nAny thoughts?\n\nThanks,\nBob\n\n",
