The developers add methods to these classes continuously. All \ntest classes are combined in a testsuite, which runs with \njunit.textui.TestRunner in a batch script.\n\nWhat I would need to see in the output of that script is the name of \neach test method which was executed. I want to avoid, that each method \nshould printout its name, but solve it automatically.\n\nWhat could I do here?\n\nAlex\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
