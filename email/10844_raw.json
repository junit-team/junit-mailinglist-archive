In my\n&gt; &gt;&gt;little Junit-misuse experiment I don&#39;t have such pre-defined hierarchy \nbut\n&gt; &gt;&gt;only decide which tests need to be run when running them (so one test\n&gt; &gt;&gt;might dynamically add 3 other tests that need to be run).\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; I have no idea as to whether or not this would work, but I have to ask \n&gt; why you would want to structure your tests in this fashion - aren&#39;t \n&gt; tests better designed as independent as possible of one another?\n\nGenerally I agree, but bear in mind that I&#39;m not talking of normal \nunit-tests here.\n\nI&#39;m testing object hierarchies and configurations for errors here (not \ncode) so for example I have 5 objects of type A where each has zero to \nfive associated objects of type B. I want to run some tests on all objects \nof type A and some tests on all objects of type B. Now I could traverse \nthe whole hierarchy in advance to get a complete overview of the test \nhierarchy needed, but it is much simpler to just let the tests themselves \nregister test-able objects whenever they come across one (additionally the \nhierarchy can be much larger and exist in persistent storage, traversing \nit twice would be terrible for performance).\n\nBtw, I&#39;ve finally decided that JUnit is not my tool here, &#39;cause it makes \nsome assumptions that I can&#39;t/don&#39;t want to meet. (Most of these \nassumptions can be broken without breaking JUnit itself, but tools that \nwork with JUnit like Eclipse become confused as hell, when a test returns \nmore than one error/failure). I&#39;m using many of the design decisions made \nfor JUnit as a guide, &#39;though.\n\nregards\nJoachim Sauer\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\n",
