Think of the EJB model as a host, an environment for your\napplication to run in. The benefits\nhere is resource pooling versioning, handling lots of transactions,\nthreading issues and generally things you\ndon&#39;t want to care about. Your business logic should be testable outside\nthat model. When you&#39;re unit testing\nyou have no need for handling lots of simultanious requests so leave that\nout of the picture until you write system\ntests, system tests are different in nature and requires different tools (I\nthink this is where EJBUnit comes in I might be wrong\nabout that I haven&#39;t used it)\n\nWe use Spring, with the spring model, a session bean becomes an empty shell\nthat delegates to your business objects defined within your spring-context.\n\nWether you use spring or not, the same pattern still applies, let the\napplication\ncontainer take care of the application container stuff (life cycle events,\npooling, etc), trust\nyour container to do that well and test your business objects outside of the\nsession beans.\n\nIf you are using CMP:s beans (look carefully at the alternative persistance\nsolutions here if you havn&#39;t already picked one)\nyou can inject mock home interfaces to your business logic classes which\ngives a quite nice abstraction to the hairy details.\n\nOnce again, Spring provides quite a lot of goodies in the EJB-context so do\nhave a look at it, it is well worth the small effort.\n\nI hope this helps, ask if anything is not clear.\nRegards\nJoakim Ohlrogge\n\n\nOn 6/7/06, saibabu_valluripalli &lt;saibabu_valluripalli@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;   Hi,\n&gt;\n&gt; I started exploring on JUnit, Can any one help me on unit testing EJB?\n&gt; Thank you very much in advance.\n&gt;\n&gt; Regards,\n&gt; Sai\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n",
