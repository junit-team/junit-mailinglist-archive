The library \n&gt; supplied by the vendor presented an API that contained only non-virtual \n&gt; functions.  The code that used the library could not be tested because \n&gt; there was no way to make sure that it was making the right calls. \n\nYou&#39;re going to have to elaborate on that case. I don&#39;t doubt you had a \nproblem, but I don&#39;t understand what it was. How do non-virtual \nfunctions imply that you couldn&#39;t tell  if it was making the right \ncalls? You say &quot;non-virtual&quot;. Was this a C++ library?\n\n&gt;  I used a DOM parsing \n&gt; library a few months ago which, by all appearances, didn&#39;t let you \n&gt; create a document in memory.  You had to either point it to a URL or the \n&gt; disk.  So, to write tests that could otherwise easily be written in \n&gt; memory, you needed either a server or a scattering of files on disk.\n&gt; \n\nThat seems OK to me. If the library doesn&#39;t need a means of creating \ndocuments in memory for its own purposes, then it shouldn&#39;t add those \njust for testing. Had it done so, you would have used those functions. \nHowever, because it didn&#39;t you tested the code in a more realistic \nfashion that is more likely to expose bugs. That&#39;s a good thing.\n\nNow if the library had a legitimate need to create documents in memory \nfor reasons other than testing, then I would add such functions. However \nI wouldn&#39;t do it just for testing.\n\n-- \n﻿Elliotte Rusty Harold  elharo@...\nJava I/O 2nd Edition Just Published!\nhttp://www.cafeaulait.org/books/javaio2/\nhttp://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0596527500/ref=nosim/cafeaulaitA/\n\n",
