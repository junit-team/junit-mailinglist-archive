When I asked\n&gt; for &quot;more modern license&quot; I did not know how close I =\r\nwas. Proliferation of\n&gt; various open source licenses is bad and I am glad u=\r\npgrading to EPL1.0 is\n&gt; allowed by CPL1.0. It can safe a lot of troubles.\n&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; Now, when it is clear that EPL1.0 is the natural evolution step, I can\n&gt;=\r\n offer some help. Kent mentioned that he has no capacity to change the\n&gt; li=\r\ncense himself. I can help changing all the JUnit sources and create a\n&gt; pat=\r\nch. The rest would be just a matter of incorporating my changes into main\n&gt;=\r\n source line and releasing binaries for under the new license...\n&gt;\n&gt; Shall =\r\nwe walk this path?\n&gt; -jt\n&gt;\n&gt; [1] The license would rather be called CPL1.1 =\r\nif &quot;the superceeding&quot; was the\n&gt; plan from begining...\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In junit@yaho=\r\nogroups.com &lt;junit%40yahoogroups.com&gt;,\n&gt; &quot;milestravisparker&quot; &lt;milesparker@.=\r\n..&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The following posts might be helpful..\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; http://=\r\ndev.eclipse.org/blogs/mike/2009/04/16/one-small-step-towards-reducing-licen=\r\nse-proliferation/\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; http://forums.pentaho.com/showthread.php?69944-Lice=\r\nnse-upgrade-from-CPL-to-EPL\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; IANAL either but the section 7 language=\r\n does appear to give any\n&gt; contributor the right to release under a success=\r\nor license, and EPL is a\n&gt; successor.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Hope you guys can get it sort=\r\ned out!\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; --- In junit@yahoogroups.com &lt;junit%40yahoogroups.com&gt;, Ken=\r\nt Beck\n&gt; &lt;kentb@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Dear Jaroslav,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Thank you f=\r\nor the message.
