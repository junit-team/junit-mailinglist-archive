If you have 100<br/>\n&gt;tests failing on a typical night, something needs to change about the<br/>\n&gt;process!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Our current project has 1040 &quot;regular&quot; JUnit tests that run in about 10<br/>\n&gt;seconds.  So the developers run all of them all day long after everything<br/>\n&gt;they do.  As soon as one of them breaks, we fix it right away.  There are<br/>\n&gt;another 200 or so tests that take a little longer (some use Catcus on the<br/>\n&gt;server side, some use database connections).  These run automatically when<br/>\n&gt;anyone checks in (kicked off by Cruise Control) , so within 10 minutes of<br/>\n&gt;submiting code to the repository, you know whether you have broken any of<br/>\n&gt;these &quot;integration level&quot; tests.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>We did this too: one set of fast tests that run always and one set of slow tests that CruiseControl runs. Very effective.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Once the norm becomes all of the tests passing (rather than 100 failing),<br/>\n&gt;the nature of your problem may change.  This is a much more scalable<br/>\n&gt;approach than trying to manage/distribute failure reports.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Absolutely. Don&#39;t treat the symptom; treat the problem.<br/>\n<br/>\nTake care.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nJ. B.
