The plublicized class action<br/>\n&gt; lawsuit against a software company because of a major defect (security,<br/>\n&gt; logic, whatever) will open the floodgates especially since membership in<br/>\n&gt; the ABA Law Group has experienced exponential growth.  Lawyers have to<br/>\n&gt; do something, right :)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Hi Joe,<br/>\n<br/>\nVery interesting points.<br/>\n<br/>\nI believe that a lot of people in the testing field and industry have<br/>\nbeen waiting for that big event that will change testing<br/>\nattitudes/practices/laws/etc.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI am very surprised it hasn&#39;t happened yet and I am no longer holding<br/>\nmy breath waiting for it :-).<br/>\n<br/>\nYour other point about risk/reward is also very good.  There are too<br/>\nmany examples of software companies that are very successful despite<br/>\nvery buggy code.<br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; You started an interesting thread, and I look forward to the other<br/>\n&gt; responses.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I am surprised at the very few responses we go so far. I guess<br/>\neveryone here has the T1 gene in spades.  There has been much more<br/>\ndiscussion on this very same topic on my Artima blog.
