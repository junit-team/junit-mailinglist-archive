I&#39;m wondering what is the right way to set up<br/>\n&gt; some random tests?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Should I just put into my tests a loop runs the test multiple times?<br/>\n&gt; This seems to imply that the test needs to call setUp() to get some<br/>\n&gt; fresh objects (&quot;test fixture&quot;) each time through the loop, which seems<br/>\n&gt; somehow wrong (at least I&#39;ve seen no examples like this).  Is there<br/>\n&gt; some better way to ask for a test to be run N times?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I got turned on to JUnit from the book<br/>\n&gt;   Building Parsers with Java™ by Steven John Metsker<br/>\n&gt; however it seems that he does not use JUnit for random tests.  He has<br/>\n&gt; a section extolling JUnit, but then a section immediately after about<br/>\n&gt; random testing that doesn&#39;t use JUnit at all.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Perhaps random testing is not considered part of unit testing?  If so,<br/>\n&gt; why?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Thanks for the help.<br/>\n&gt; --Erik N<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Yahoo!
