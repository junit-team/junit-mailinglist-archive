This is an<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; important trait of any good test, and not just tests<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; that use a database.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I preface this question with &quot;I know very little about<br/>\n&gt; EJB&#39;s&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Is it possible to implement the findAll logic in a<br/>\n&gt; POJO which is then easier to test?  Or is the code<br/>\n&gt; likely to be just a call to an EJB API?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It&#39;s certainly possible. Typically all one needs to do is pass in the <br/>\nDataSource or Connection to the POJO and off you go.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have found in general, though, that when someone asks a question like <br/>\nthis, it&#39;s more effective to nudge them in the right direction, rather <br/>\nthan tell them they&#39;re doing it all wrong. :) For that reason, I suggest <br/>\nsmall, useful improvements, rather than overhauling the approach.<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes the person comes back and tells me that what they have is <br/>\nbetter, but they want something even better than that. At that point, I <br/>\ntalk about decoupling database client code from the database.<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJ. B.
