I really have to thank you for not using this as an opportunity to<br/>\ndistract. Right after I sent this I feared I&#39;d be told &quot;integration not<br/>\nunit&quot; and have the whole thread thrown out (or get side tracked) for that<br/>\none thought. That would be a shame on one example.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat all said, I half wonder if you are being tongue in check or<br/>\nsomething -- seriously -- because if you aren&#39;t joking, you said &quot;this test<br/>\nis best if it depends upon that test&quot;. Further, you said use a side effect<br/>\n(saved result) of one test for the next. [If you are saying store it in a<br/>\nfile, check that file in and test against it, then aren&#39;t we risking that<br/>\nthe output changes and the test isn&#39;t truly valid?] This all confuses me,<br/>\nsince it seems to go against so much of what you said.<br/>\n<br/>\nBeing more practical than purist I just need to know that my code works, I<br/>\ndon&#39;t care too much what is an internal-to-my-code-integration test, or not.<br/>\nAs such, I concur with what you are saying -- but I&#39;d have my second test<br/>\nuse the class in the first, not us stored results or mock objects. I need to<br/>\nknow that the solution I provide works as a unit (irrespective of user<br/>\ninput/others) that is my goal for using junit. If not we could never junit<br/>\nanything above the JDK &#39;cos we&#39;d be doing &quot;integration&quot; test.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, do we have a valuable concept of a dependency? If this is the best way<br/>\nfor me, the user, is to test my code -- ought I be able to want it to stop<br/>\nif the walker failed?<br/>\n<br/>\nregards,<br/>\n<br/>\nAdam</div>",
