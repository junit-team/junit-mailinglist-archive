But I have a followup\nquestion.  Again, I&#39;m pretty new to java so this is a bit of a brain-teaser for\nme.\n\nIn your example, I think you are assuming a class variable &#39;Connection&#39; in the\nMyTestSetup class, as follows:\n\nclass MyTestSetup extends TestSetup {\n  Connection connection;\n  public MyTestSetup( Test t ) {\n    super(t);\n  }\n\n  protected void setUp() {\n    connection = DriverManager.getConnection(&quot;jdbc:url&quot;);\n  }\n\n  protected void tearDown() {\n  }\n}\n\nSo in the MyTest class there is a unit-test called &#39;testOne()&#39;.  To extend your\nexample, this unit-test needs a reference to the Connection instance saved in\nthe &#39;MyTestSetup&#39; class.  How does it get it?  I am guessing that class\nvariables are also needed in the MyTest class just like in the MyTestSetup\nclass, and maybe the &#39;MyTest.setup&#39; method needs to initialize the\nMyTest.connection class variable before each test starts.  But how does the\nMyTest find a reference to the MyTestSetup instance?\n\nthanks\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncharliehubbard76@... on 12/26/2000 10:13:04 AM\n\nPlease respond to junit@egroups.com\n\nTo:   junit@egroups.com\ncc:    (bcc: Stephen P Peterson/CT/Unitedmail)\nSubject:  [junit] Re: newbie question: how to avoid rerunning fixture code on\n      every test\n\n\n\n\n--- In junit@egroups.com, &quot;Stephen P Peterson&quot;\n&lt;stephen.peterson@i...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; What if the setup logic involves connecting to databases and\n&gt; running queries that tends to be a bit slow for doing on every\n&gt; single test?  Is an explanation available anywhere on the web\n&gt; telling how to get tests to run faster by executing slow\n&gt; initialization code only once before all the tests?\n\nStephen,\n\nWhat you want to do is create a class that extends TestSetup.\nTestSetups allow you to do some initilization/de-initilization around\na test suite just as you described.\n\nclass MyTestSetup extends TestSetup {\n  public MyTestSetup( Test t ) {\n    super(t);\n  }\n\n  protected void setUp() {\n    Connection = DriverManager.getConnection(&quot;jdbc:url&quot;);\n  }\n\n  protected void tearDown() {\n  }\n}\n\nclass MyTest extends TestCase {\n  public MyTest( String name ) {\n    super( name );\n  }\n\n  public void testOne() {\n  }\n\n  public static Test suite() {\n     return new MyTestSetup( new TestSuite( MyTest.class ) );\n  }\n\n  public static void main( String args[] ) {\n     TestRunner.run( suite() );\n  }\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nTo unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\njunit-unsubscribe@egroups.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
