When you&#39;re an API writer, it behooves you to make your<br/>\n&gt; library<br/>\n&gt; &gt; general enough that it can be used for cases you didn&#39;t envision, or<br/>\n&gt; you&#39;ll<br/>\n&gt; &gt; make the life of your users harder<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m sorry, but I flat out disagree. You should put in what is currently<br/>\n&gt; needed, no more. Do not try to support use cases you do not envision and<br/>\n&gt; do not understand. The bottom line is that if you leave something out,<br/>\n&gt; you can always add it later. However, once you&#39;ve shipped API it becomes<br/>\n&gt; impossible to take it away<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Exactly, which is exactly why you should be humble when you ship your code<br/>\nand open it up.  Assume that people will use it in ways you didn&#39;t think of,<br/>\nand make it possible for them to do so in ways that you control (always an<br/>\ninteresting exercise, by the way, it forces you to think out of the box and<br/>\nto break your habits).<br/>\n<br/>\nMichael showed a pretty compelling case where the vendor forgot to make<br/>\ntheir methods virtual, and I&#39;ve seen this mistake and more general ones so<br/>\nmany times in dozens of API&#39;s and libraries I wish people locked down their<br/>\ncode a lot less.<br/>\n<br/>\nReal life example:  a programmer on my team once had to do &quot;#define private<br/>\npublic&quot; in order to use a certain functionality.  There was simply no other<br/>\nchoice.  That&#39;s exactly what I meant above by &quot;keeping control&quot;: if you open<br/>\nyour code in ways that you choose, you, the library author, remain in<br/>\ncontrol and remove the need for this kind of ugly hack.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAdding functionality without a clear use case is a recipe for bloated<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; APIs that don&#39;t work particularly well.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t see why, if they are carefully designed.  Document the extension<br/>\npoints, and draw a clear line between what is exposed and will be supported<br/>\nand what might change from one release to the next.<br/>\n<br/>\nWithout this mindset, frameworks such as Spring or Eclipse would never<br/>\nexist.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Same thing if your API will be reading data:  make it possible for this<br/>\n&gt; data<br/>\n&gt; &gt; to come from virtually any possible source:  file, stream, iterator,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; network, database, etc...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; In Java this is usually no big deal because it&#39;s all just streams (or<br/>\n&gt; readers). There&#39;s enough abstraction built into the core libraries to<br/>\n&gt; handle this. How this tends to work in C++, I don&#39;t know.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yes, the Java libraries support the &quot;open open principle&quot; very well in<br/>\njava.io, at the cost of some added verbosity (a small price to pay in my<br/>\nopinion).<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nCédric<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://testng.org\">http://testng.org</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",
