Most\ndev=\r\nelopers have experience already about tests they should have\nwritten: they&#39;=\r\nre the tests that would have prevented the bugs that\nhave hurt you worst.  =\r\nAs you get more experienced, the maxim of &quot;test\nuntil fear turns to boredom=\r\n&quot; is wise.  If you have a good\ntest-coverage tool, that can help generate f=\r\near, when you ask yourself\n&quot;I don&#39;t have a single unit test running this me=\r\nthod.  Am I OK with\nthat?&quot;\n\nOne of my personal favorite ways to bootstrap e=\r\nxperience is\ntest-driven development: every time all your tests pass, and y=\r\nou&#39;re\nsatisfied with the design of your code so far, write a test for your\n=\r\nnext feature, which will break, and then make it pass.\n\nDoes that help?\n\n  =\r\n David Saff\n\nOn Wed, Dec 9, 2009 at 6:21 AM, loicmidy &lt;loicmidy@...&gt; =\r\nwrote:\n&gt; Hello,\n&gt;\n&gt; I have read severals books about Junit. The books expla=\r\nin well how to design a unit testable code and how to use stub and mock BUT=\r\n I found few explanations about which unit test should we write.\n&gt;\n&gt; The on=\r\nly references I found were :\n&gt; 1 : in pragramtic unit testing (summary free=\r\n here http://media.pragprog.com/titles/utj/StandaloneSummary.pdf )\n&gt; 2 : a =\r\nessay too simple to break on junit faq and in Junit book.\n&gt;\n&gt; do you have f=\r\nuther guidance? The question which unit test to do is as important as the q=\r\nuestion how to do unit test because if we don&#39;t do the good unit tests then=\r\n the ROI will be low (or even negative) and the practice won&#39;t last long wi=\r\nthin the programmers teams.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; yours sincerely\n&gt; lo=EFc midy\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; -=\r\n-----------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
