I&#39;m using <br/>\nJProbe Coverage from Sitraka software to get the code coverage <br/>\ninformation.<br/>\nJPCoverage calls ant which in turn runs my unit tests. I&#39;ve been <br/>\ncareful to set &quot;fork=&quot;no&quot; in my junit ant task so that my tests run <br/>\nin the same jvm as ant.<br/>\nDespite this, and despite the fact that it&#39;s clear my tests are <br/>\nexecuting, jpcoverage is still reporting 0% coverage of my code.<br/>\nDoes anybody have any experience with this? I&#39;m wondering what I <br/>\ncould be doing wrong.<br/>\nI realize that there&#39;s also a jpcoverage ant task which would then <br/>\nrun JProbe inside my ant project (rather than vice versa); would this <br/>\nbe a superior approach? I suspect I would have the same problem.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\nMT</div>",
