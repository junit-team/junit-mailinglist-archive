I will explain the situation and was\nhoping that may=\r\nbe someone could point me in the right direction.\n\nI have written a SQL par=\r\nser which parses a SQL query and builds an\nobject model representation of s=\r\name which it returns as the result of\na parse.  The object model has the ab=\r\nility to print itself and so long\nas the parser works correctly what it pri=\r\nnts will be very close to the\ninput query.  A single test case then consist=\r\ns of parsing a query,\ncalling printMe( ) on the resultant tree and comparin=\r\ng it&#39;s output to\nwhat was expected, which again, is very similar to but not=\r\n identical\nto the original query.\n\nSo, first a general question: I know tha=\r\nt his is closer to end to end\ntesting than it is to the sort of fine graine=\r\nd class level tests JUNIT\nis designed for.  Is JUNIT even appropriate?  Ass=\r\numing the answer is\nyes, I&#39;ll continue.\n\nThe pseudo code for a single test =\r\ncase would look like this:\n\nString orgnlQry =3D &quot;Select * from MyTable.MyCo=\r\nlumn&quot;;\nString expectedQry =3D &quot;Select * from MyColumn&quot;;\nParser myParser =3D=\r\n new Parser( );\n// A bunch of code to construct Parser and connect to data =\r\nstore\nmyParser.parse(orgnlQry);\nSQLTree tree =3D myParser.getTree( );\nStrin=\r\ng outQry =3D tree.printMe( );\nassertEquals(outQry, expectedQry);\n\nI&#39;d like =\r\nall of my test cases to use the same parser instance so that\nI only have to=\r\n initialize it once.  The only variables for each test\nthan are the orgnl/e=\r\nxpectedQry pairs of which I&#39;ve got about 120.  \n\nI&#39;m able to get a single t=\r\nest case running but I can&#39;t figure out how\nto eliminate duplicate code.  I=\r\n&#39;m also no sure how to organize the\ntests.  Shold there really be 120 diffe=\r\nrent test methods or is there\nsome way to call the same test method 120 tim=\r\nes with different input\nstrings?  \n\nThanks in advance for any suggestions a=\r\nnyone can provide.\n\n-ts1971\n\n\n",
