The\nJUnit site maintains a lot of use=\r\nful information and links to other\nresources. Many of the articles there ar=\r\ne directed towards the\nbeginner and will help you greatly as you learn abou=\r\nt JUnit. Google is\nuseful when there&#39;s something you need, but don&#39;t know w=\r\nhat it is.\nJust type a description in, press enter and see how much help it=\r\n can\nbe. I&#39;ve found quite a few useful things that way. Another tip with\nGo=\r\nogle is to search on the specific error message that you have, often\nyou&#39;ll=\r\n find forum discussions about that exact error, with a good\nchance of a sol=\r\nution being given as well.\n\nAs you learn and start having questions, you wi=\r\nll also find the JUnit\nFAQ very helpful. The questions that it answers real=\r\nly are the\nfrequent ones that most of us had asked or wondered about and Mi=\r\nke\nClark does a wonderful job of collating it. Here is a link:\n\nhttp://juni=\r\nt.sourceforge.net/doc/faq/faq.htm\n\nWhen you are ready to start asking more =\r\nquestions on the JUnit mailing\nlist, please consider following all of the a=\r\ndvice in Eric Raymond&#39;s\nvery helpful document: &quot;How to ask questions the sm=\r\nart way&quot;, available\nat his website. Here is a link:\n\nhttp://www.catb.org/~e=\r\nsr/faqs/smart-questions.html\n\nAs far as books are concerned, I recommend Pr=\r\nagmatic Unit Testing by\nHunt and Thomas for beginners. JUnit recipes by Rai=\r\nnsberger is good\nonce you&#39;re past the basics. There are other good books ou=\r\nt there, but\nthese are my recommendations.\n\nI hope that this helps.\n\nSimon\n=\r\n\n--\nwww.simonpeter.com\n\n\nOn 9/28/05, Jagadish Sreedevi &lt;jsreedevi@dharbor.c=\r\nom&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Hi All,\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; I am a new member to this group, new to work w=\r\nith Junit And new for\n&gt; testing also.\n&gt;\n&gt; Can anyone suggest me  good books=\r\n or documents which have many examples\n&gt; of testcases, testsuites.\n&gt;\n&gt; And =\r\nplease suggest me, what more things do I need to understand about\n&gt; junit a=\r\ns a beginner.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Regards,\n&gt;\n&gt; Sreedevi.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; [Non-text portions of =\r\nthis message have been removed]\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
