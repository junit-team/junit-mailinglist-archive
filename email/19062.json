(TestNG has more &quot;test grouping&quot;<br/>\nfeatures so you may want to look into it.)<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for automating the testing, I&#39;d suggest that you look into a real<br/>\nContinuous Integration server like CruiseControl or Continuum. Cron is<br/>\ngreat for simple stuff but most people benefit from real CI.<br/>\n<br/>\nWayne<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On 3/7/07, niklassaers &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:niklassaers@...\">niklassaers@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; Hi guys,<br/>\n&gt; for our project me and a friend are using JUnit heavily. Our<br/>\n&gt; application is a client that collects data and a backend that<br/>\n&gt; organizes and analyses it. Lately we have started to use JUnit tests<br/>\n&gt; to ensure that our database is sane, and these tests take quite a<br/>\n&gt; while. Now, I don&#39;t actually need to know that the database is still<br/>\n&gt; sane every time I recompile, so I&#39;d like to ignore them. But adding<br/>\n&gt; and removing @Ignore&#39;s will fill up our CVS repo quickly. Besides,<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve also set up a box to run tests from cron, and I&#39;d like to i.e. do<br/>\n&gt; most tests every 15 minutes (gives me a nice little pop-up when<br/>\n&gt; something breaks) and only run the DB sanity every four hours. How can<br/>\n&gt; I make a testing schedule? Should I do this through ANT? Can I make a<br/>\n&gt; property-file for JUnit that checks if a certain time has elapsed? At<br/>\n&gt; the moment my fileset is just &lt;include name=&quot;**/test/**/*.java&quot;/&gt;  I<br/>\n&gt; hope I don&#39;t have to make individual ant targets and list the files<br/>\n&gt; manually! :-) What are my options?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Cheers<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   Nik<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Yahoo!
