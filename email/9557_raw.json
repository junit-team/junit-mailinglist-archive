Would you\n&gt; say it&#39;s an interpreted language?\n\nYes, to a degree.  However, C++ deals with much of this at compile time.\nThink template metaprogramming.  Typical benchmarks show C++ running at\n97% or so of the speed of C.  As you add interpretation, the speed goes\ndown.\n\nThis is an old issue.  About 20 years ago, Intel had two candidate\nfuture CPUs.  One was the 386, and the other was the iAPX 432, a machine\ndesigned to run object-oriented languages, Smalltalk in particular.\nThis was an exciting project.  Books and papers were written on the\nsubject; people knew that this was the way of the future.\n\nBut after a bright beginning, the 432 project was destroyed by benchmarks\npublished by a team at the University of California at Berkeley.  These\nshowed the 432 being easily beaten by, as I recall, an Intel 8080 (8086?),\na commodity 8-bit processor.\n\nThe benchmarks were biased; they had been set up by the RISC team at\nBerkeley, who had a vested interest in seeing complex architectures fail.\nHowever, the point proven was that object-oriented programming techniques\nand run-time interpretation have a high overhead.\n\nPlease bear in mind when considering these remarks that I was one of those\nexcited by the 432 ;-)\n\n--\nJim Dixon  jdd@...   tel +44 117 982 0786  mobile +44 797 373 7881\n\n\n",
