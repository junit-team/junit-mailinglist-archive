The capability is \nexactly what I need.  \n\nI am having a bit of a problem implementing it. If you could give me\nan short example, I would appreciate it. Here is an outline of what I \nhave tried so far.\n\nIn the original post you requested an assert that would take two file \nnames and return a boolean. So, before reading .java files, I tried \nthe following and was told that there were not enough arguments:\nassertFile(&quot;file1&quot;, &quot;file2&quot;);\n\nThen being stubborn I tried:\nassertFile(&quot;file1&quot;, &quot;file2&quot;, null);\n\nThis ran fine, however, file1 and file2 did not exist.\n\nIf you could provide an example of the diff parameter that needs to \nbe passed, I would appreciate it. The html mentioned a \njunit.diff.SimpleDiff.  I would like to use this.  However, I cannot \nfind it in the package.\n\nOnce again, I would like to say that this is an excellent idea.  It \nwould be nice to see the documentation expanded.\n\nFaith\n\n--- In junit@y..., Vitezslav Stejskal &lt;vitezslav.stejskal@c...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Dear All,\n&gt; \n&gt; couple of days ago I asked for available file-diff capabilities in \nJUnit.\n&gt; Jim answered me and posted code snippet, which I found useful, but\n&gt; not sufficiently for my task. Thus I developed simple extension of\n&gt; JUnit framework which allows to use file-diff in more convenient \nway.\n&gt; \n&gt; Hopefully it could be useful for others as well, I would like to \ncontinue\n&gt; in this work and will be pleasured to see it integrated in next \nversions of\n&gt; JUnit framework. Please, let me know if this is possible.\n&gt; \n&gt; Sorry for the attachement, but it&#39;s very small, it contains the \ndescription\n&gt; of announced extension as well as source codes and compiled classes.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt; Vita\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Jim Jackl-Mochel wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; I will simply repost the code that was sent to me originally when \nI posted\n&gt; &gt; the same question:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I don&#39;t have one coded up in a base class, but here is the code \nI use...\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;         public void assertFilesEqual(File fileOne, File \nfileTwo) {\n&gt; &gt; &gt;                 assertEquals(readFile(fileOne), readFile\n(fileTwo));\n&gt; &gt; &gt;         }\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;         private static String readFile(File fileToRead) {\n&gt; &gt; &gt;                 StringBuffer fileContents = new StringBuffer\n(&quot;&quot;);\n&gt; &gt; &gt;                 try {\n&gt; &gt; &gt;                         BufferedReader in = new BufferedReader\n(new\n&gt; &gt; FileReader(fileToRead));\n&gt; &gt; &gt;                         String line;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;                         while ((line = in.readLine()) != null) {\n&gt; &gt; &gt;                                 fileContents.append(line+&quot;&#92;n&quot;);\n&gt; &gt; &gt;                         }\n&gt; &gt; &gt;                         in.close();\n&gt; &gt; &gt;                 } catch (Exception e) {\n&gt; &gt; &gt;                         System.err.println(e.toString());\n&gt; &gt; &gt;                         return &quot;&quot;;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;                 }\n&gt; &gt; &gt;                 return new String (fileContents);\n&gt; &gt; &gt;         }\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Good luck.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Jim JM\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; &gt; From: Vitezslav Stejskal [mailto:vitezslav.stejskal@c...]\n&gt; &gt; Sent: Tuesday, February 13, 2001 7:55 AM\n&gt; &gt; To: junit\n&gt; &gt; Subject: [junit] File Diff in JUnit\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Hi All,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I am the Netbeans developer working on integration\n&gt; &gt; of JUnit test framework to Netbeans IDE. I would like to\n&gt; &gt; ask, if there are plans to have file-diff capabality included in \nJUnit.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; My idea is to implement assertFile(file1, file2)  method,\n&gt; &gt; which will compare two files and produce the file containing\n&gt; &gt; differences (if there will be some).\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; As long as this is crutial for netbeans internal tests, I am able\n&gt; &gt; to spend some time by the developement on that field. I would\n&gt; &gt; like to know if there is already some work done or if there is\n&gt; &gt; anybody willing to cooperate.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Thanks for your response,\n&gt; &gt; Vita\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; --\n&gt; &gt; Vitezslav Stejskal, Software engineer\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; SUN Microsystems Czech s.r.o.\n&gt; &gt; e-mail: vitezslav.stejskal@c...\n&gt; &gt; tel:    +420 2 3300-9232\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; &gt; junit-unsubscribe@y...\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; &gt; junit-unsubscribe@y...\n&gt; \n&gt; --\n&gt; Vitezslav Stejskal, Software engineer\n&gt; \n&gt; SUN Microsystems Czech s.r.o.\n&gt; e-mail: vitezslav.stejskal@c...\n&gt; tel:    +420 2 3300-9232\n\n\n",
