B. Rainsberger wrote:\n&gt; In many cases, when programmers don&#39;t test their own code, they deliver\n&gt; such low quality work that testers spend their time writing and running\n&gt; trivial test cases, driving out silly bugs, rather than being allowed to\n&gt; spend their time writing interesting tests, driving out the kinds of\n&gt; bugs that drive customers crazy.\nBob Bondi wrote:\n&gt; As a professional QA person with over 20 years hand-on experience it \n&gt; is my sad duty to report that the schema for testing being discussed \n&gt; is a set-back to quality. [...] The problem is (especially in Agile \n&gt; methods) the time for QA has been cut drastically. The need for \n&gt; integration testing is greater than ever before, but the time QA has \n&gt; for that activity is reduced to such short periods that that type of \n&gt; testing is relegated to last, IMHO. \nBob,\n\nThank you for un-lurking.  I think I could learn something from your \nexperience.  I&#39;m not sure, though, if your response was directly to \nJ.B.&#39;s comment, or to the tone of discussion in general.  J.B. suggests \nthat if programmers don&#39;t test their own code, it wastes QA time.  Are \nyou saying that if programmers don&#39;t test their own code, they get it to \nQA quicker, giving more time for effective QA?\n\nThanks again,\n\n    David Saff\n\n",
