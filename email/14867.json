But maybe your experience differs?<br/>\n<br/>\nI must admit I don&#39;t have much experience testing applications in a ME<br/>\nsetting yet. I am, however, doing some testing of a java application which<br/>\nis supposed to run on both J2SE 1.3 and above and J2ME CDC/Foundation. So<br/>\nfar, I have not tested this on J2ME platforms (or equivalent emulators). <br/>\n<br/>\nI agree totally that most most bugs are probably programming errors that<br/>\nare relevant to all J2ME devices. I also agree that testing on an emulator<br/>\nwould be convenient and beneficial. But when a suitable emulator is not<br/>\navailable, testing on a small device, or using a J2ME vm on a desktop<br/>\nmachine as I mentioned earlier, is probably better than no testing at all.<br/>\nThat is why I asked if there are any knwon issues using JUnit and/or<br/>\nTestNG on a J2ME CDC device.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJohn<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n__________________________________ <br/>\nYahoo!
