Is that what it&#39;s\ndoing?  If I had the source I&#39;d grep through it to see.\n \nAs Fergus noted, if you don&#39;t use JUnit&#39;s custom class loader, you have to\nrestart the test application after each recompile.  This causes a\nsignificant slowdown in the edit-compile-test cycle.  Since the vast\nmajority of applications don&#39;t have to play explicit games with the class\nloader, using the custom class loader for testing is a reasonable default.\nThe default used to be to use the system class loader, but that was changed\nin version 3.3 and noted in the README file.  You&#39;re probably right that it\nshould be noted in the FAQ, since it does seem to come up frequently.\nActually, looking at the FAQ, I notice the junit.util.excluded.properties\nnoted there.  Perhaps this is another solution to the problem; you could run\na test or check the source code.\n \nMy points are that Erich and Kent have done us all a big favor by releasing\nthis code.  This code is still evolving; it&#39;s not surprising that the user\ndocumentation lags behind the capabilities, especially since the authors\nderive no remuneration for it.  However, the question about class loading\nproblems has been answered as often as it&#39;s been asked, and the answers can\nbe easily found both on sourceforge (\nhttp://sourceforge.net/forum/message.php?msg_id=97007\n&lt;http://sourceforge.net/forum/message.php?msg_id=97007&gt; ) and here (I\nsearched the archives for &quot;loader constraints&quot;).  Searching the yahoogroups\narchive, I found the message http://groups.yahoo.com/group/junit/message/419\n&lt;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/junit/message/419&gt;  that verifies the\nexcluded.properties solution works.\n \nSo, it seems to me that you&#39;re whinging about losing time for which your\nclient is paying, and instead of thinking you should have determined the\nproblem quicker or thinking that solving such problems is part of\n&quot;delivering bullet-proof software,&quot; you&#39;re thinking that the authors of a\nfree test package (that saves you time) have failed you.  I&#39;m sorry to have\nto put it so bluntly, but you didn&#39;t get the hint in my previous message.\n(BTW, if you check the JUnit zip file, you&#39;ll find test cases that indicate\nthe authors DID test the program.)  As I see it, you&#39;re still looking a gift\nhorse in the mouth and you still haven&#39;t answered the question, &quot;how would\nyou have done it better?&quot;\n \n - George\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: Herrick, Chuck [mailto:chuck.herrick@...]\nSent: Tuesday, March 27, 2001 9:44 AM\nTo: &#39;junit@yahoogroups.com&#39;\nSubject: RE: [junit] cannot run testing with UI TestRunner?\n\n\n\nDid you not see this?

First of all, I find JUnit to be a\nwonderful help and I&#39;m very glad to have it.  Second, the JUnit classloader\nDOES work.  I don&#39;t know what&#39;s going on within org.w3c.dom.Document, but in\ngeneral, when the -noloading switch solves the problem it indicates that\nsome part of the software is using a different class loader and that results\nin an object mismatch.  The response to this is to disable JUnit&#39;s reloading\nclass loader and use the default one (which will not reload changed classes)\nthat the software under test is expecting.  Is this a bad design decision?\nDo you have a better solution to this problem?\n\n\t  \n - George \n\n\t-----Original Message-----\nFrom: Herrick, Chuck [ mailto:chuck.herrick@...\n&lt;mailto:chuck.herrick@...&gt; ]\nSent: Tuesday, March 27, 2001 8:37 AM\nTo: &#39;junit@yahoogroups.com&#39;\nSubject: RE: [junit] cannot run testing with UI TestRunner?\n\n\n\n\tTake a look at the security machinations that Java demands the\nclassloader undergo on behalf of the virtual machine. \n\n\tI would say that if JUnit can&#39;t complete some very fundamental piece\nof its business because the authors made bad design decisions regarding the\nclassloader, you&#39;d need to get someone to go back and refactor JUnit.\n\n\tPerhaps someone should have tested JUnit with some test software\nbefore rolling it out. \n\n\n\tYahoo!
