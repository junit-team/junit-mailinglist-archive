One of our projects runs daily against <br/>\nthe stock markets, so the data changes daily. In addition to new data <br/>\nfrom the daily trading, stock symbols change, and change back again <br/>\nweekly. So using the live data would result in constant breakage of test <br/>\ncases.<br/>\n   However, I agree that real data has exactly the kind of real-world <br/>\nanomalies that one needs to test against, and I know of no way to fake <br/>\nthose kinds of data.<br/>\n<br/>\n  So, we use several test databases, which are snapshots of the <br/>\nreal-world data from the live sites. This way we have static datasets to <br/>\ntest against, but we have all the kinds of data anomalies that our <br/>\nsoftware encounters in the real runs.  It requires a bit of storage, but <br/>\nonce we have a set of test cases to run against, we never have to touch <br/>\nthem again.  As the project has grown, and we have discovered new tests <br/>\n(to handle anomalies that we had not seen previously) we add a new test <br/>\nsuite that references a new snapshot of the real-world environment, <br/>\nwhile the older test cases continue to refer to their own snapshots.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis seems to work for us, in a fairly dynamic real world domain,<br/>\n<br/>\nJim<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJames P.

With &quot;test data&quot; <br/>\n&gt;I mean data which I create in my test program and which I persist in <br/>\n&gt;the database. After the test finished, I delete the test data (with an <br/>\n&gt;EntityGarbageCollector).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;But our new project leader thinks we should use only real data (&quot;one <br/>\n&gt;dataset for all tests&quot;). I don&#39;t think that this would work. We need <br/>\n&gt;both strategies I think, even if one solution seems to be redundant.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;To only use real test data has big disadvantages in my opinion:<br/>\n&gt;- if data changes (real data does), then tests break<br/>\n&gt;- you need much more real data than test data to cover all the <br/>\n&gt;boundaries and use cases<br/>\n&gt;- if you add real data or remove real data from the dataset, tests <br/>\n&gt;might break<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;What do you think about it?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>---------------------------------<br/>\nYahoo!
