But this can get messy when dealing\n&gt; &gt; with many files and packages. Is there a more graceful way of \ndoing\n&gt; &gt; this?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; a) Organize test cases in the same package as the class under test\n&gt; b) Change the accessibility of the class under test\n&gt; \n&gt; ------------------\nBut a and b are the things that I don&#39;t want to do, if you read my \noriginal message.  There are many reasons why I need it in a \ndifferent directory.  Also to change the production code just to \nsatisfy unit testing doesn&#39;t sound so good.  There is a reason why we \ndidn&#39;t want to make it public.  So do you know of any graceful way of \ndoing this besides a and b?\n\n\n&gt; Tag, you&#39;re it!   ;-)\n&gt; \n&gt; Mike\n&gt; \n&gt; --\n&gt; Mike Clark\n&gt; Clarkware Consulting, Inc.\n&gt; http://www.clarkware.com\n&gt; 720.851.2014\n\n\n",
