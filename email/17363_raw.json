I asked \nreaders and would-be readers of the book to join me and ask me questions \nabout testing, TDD and JUnit.\n\nOne person ventured that there &quot;wasn&#39;t much difference&quot; between writing \nthe test first and the code first, so he wondered why I stressed writing \nthe test first. Here is a rough approximation of my answer.\n\n&quot;Well, first, let me ask you what happens when you write the code first, \nthen test it. There are a few possibilities:\n\n  * write the code, write the tests, they pass, all is well\n  * write the code, write the tests, one fails, debug\n  * write the code, find it difficult to write the tests, rewrite the \ncode to be easier to test\n\n&quot;I&#39;m sure there are more, but that&#39;s good enough for now. I imagine \nyou&#39;ve experienced all three of these. [He had.] Now take a guess how \noften #2 and #3 happen. [He guessed around half the time for each.] Take \na guess how often #1 happens. [He guessed less than half the time.] Now \nlet&#39;s do a little computation.\n\n&quot;Suppose that 1/2 the time, you get happy path #1. That means that 1/2 \nof 1/2 the time, or 1/4 of the time, you write the code, then either \nhave to rewrite it to write the tests, or write a test that causes the \ncode to fail. If you had written the tests first, that 1/4 of the time \nwould disappear, and the 1/2 of the time you get happy path #1 wouldn&#39;t \nbe any different.\n\n&quot;Now that I think of it, that&#39;s wrong. Path #3 is like refactoring to be \nable to add the next feature. Suppose that that cost is the same. Now, \nsomewhere between a negligible amount of time and 1/4 of the time, TDD \nhelps you by reducing the likelihood you&#39;ll write code that fails a test \nyou know you need to write, because by writing the test first, you won&#39;t \nstop after writing code that fails the test.\n\n&quot;Now notice that this is a /best/ case scenario, based on your \nexperience. It&#39;s likely that you get happy path #1 less than 1/2 the \ntime, so the number of times you hit paths #2 and #3 is greater. This \nincreases the cost of test-second compared to test-first.&quot;\n\nLet&#39;s bring this back to your example.\n\n &gt;  &gt; &gt; With test first, you have something like: Test v1, Code v1, Test v2,\n &gt;  &gt; Code\n &gt;  &gt; &gt; v2, Test v3, Code v3. Check in.\n &gt;  &gt; &gt;\n &gt;  &gt; &gt; If you postpone your testing a bit, you have: Code v1, Code v2, Code\n &gt;  &gt; v3,\n &gt;  &gt; &gt; Test v3, Commit.\n\nIf you postpone your testing a bit, you have: Code v1, Code v2, Code v3, \nTest v0.1, Code v3.1, Test v0.2, Code v3.2, Test v1, Code v3.3, Commit. \nThis is because the act of writing the tests exposes flaws in the design \nthat make the test difficult to write.\n\nTake care.\n-- \nJ.
