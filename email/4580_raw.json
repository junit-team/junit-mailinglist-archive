Then again, they might just use the method that suits their needs.\nI&#39;m not sure.\n\nI would probably attempt to refine the the ItinBuilder a bit.  Let&#39;s take a\nlook...\n\n(I love flight management systems!  They were always so fun and challenging.  Of\ncourse, we didn&#39;t have Java back then.)\n\npublic class ItinBuilder {\n\n    public void buildItins(segment[] segs);\n    private sortByDptrDate();\n    private identifyDupeSegs();\n    private createUniqueItins();\n    private createAllItins();\n}\n\nPerhaps sortByDptrDate() could take an array of Segments(?) and return them in\nsorted order.  The buildItins() methods might then use that, but it&#39;s available to\nother clients as well.  It&#39;s probably even more testable that way, as you could\nmock up a collection of Segments and assert that they were returned in sorted\norder.\n\nI&#39;m not sure, but the code seems to want more parameters and return values.  You\nknow the implementation better than I, and there&#39;s no right or wrong answer here.\nIt&#39;s design, after all, and you are the world&#39;s leading authority on where you\nwant your design to go.\n\nThis is just what I do when faced with a private/protected method I want to test.\nI see if it really wants to be a public method to add more value from the client&#39;s\nperspective.  If it doesn&#39;t want to go public, I default to protected access and\nmy tests are in the same package (different directory).\n\nMike\n\n--\nMike Clark\nClarkware Consulting, Inc.\nhttp://www.clarkware.com\n720.851.2014\n\n\n\n",
