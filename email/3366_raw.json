When you want to run T with profiling you run Tp. When you want\n&gt; to run T without it you just run T. This is very similar to the way\n&gt; JUnitPerf works.\n\n\nThe question you have to ask yourself is where you want to add \ncomplexity.  If you want the user to do the work -&gt; 2nd proposition, \notherwise the 1st is IMHO better.\n\nI like to separate &quot;writing tests&quot; from &quot;running tests&quot; so IMO profiling \nis simply another way to run your tests -&gt; 1st proposition.\n\nFurthermore, the work of profiling is done by your runner (with Tp or T \n+ special runner) in every case so keep things as simple as possible for \nthe user and do all the work -&gt; 1st proposition.\n\n-Vladimir\n\n-- \nVladimir Bossicard\nwww.bossicard.com\n\n\n",
