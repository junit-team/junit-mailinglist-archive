I will look into it. I like Bill&#39;s suggestion.\n&gt; Since this concept is becoming more popular imho it would be nice if it is supported by junit.\n&gt;\n&gt; Lars\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In junit@yahoogroups.com, Bill Venners&lt;bill@...&gt;  wrote:\n&gt;&gt; Hi David,\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I usually see this concept called &quot;pending&quot; in other test frameworks. It is\n&gt;&gt; a useful concept, especially when testing in a BDD style. People like to\n&gt;&gt; sometimes &quot;flesh out their ideas&quot; by writing descriptive test names for\n&gt;&gt; which neither the test code nor the code under test as yet exists. I do\n&gt;&gt; support pending tests in ScalaTest, and when running through JUnit call them\n&gt;&gt; ignored tests. That&#39;s the closest thing to pending already understood by\n&gt;&gt; tools that integrate with JUnit. So if you add something called pending, you\n&gt;&gt; could still possibly report it as an ignored test. To see an example, look\n&gt;&gt; on line 80 of RunNotifierReporter:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; http://code.google.com/p/scalatest/source/browse/trunk/src/main/scala/org/scalatest/junit/RunNotifierReporter.scala\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Basically I do this:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; // Closest thing we can do with pending is report an ignored test\n&gt;&gt;        case TestPending(ordinal, suiteName, suiteClassName, testName,\n&gt;&gt; formatter, payload, threadName, timeStamp) =&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; runNotifier.fireTestIgnored(Description.createSuiteDescription(testDescriptionName(suiteName,\n&gt;&gt; suiteClassName, testName)))\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; So what you could do as a JUnit enhancement is for a pending test call\n&gt;&gt; fireTestIgnored with perhaps a subclass of Description called\n&gt;&gt; PendingDescription. So existing tools would still understand it is a\n&gt;&gt; Description, but newer versions could detect it is a PendingDescription and\n&gt;&gt; act accordingly. Or just add some state to Description that old tools would\n&gt;&gt; ignore and new ones could use to differentiate pending tests from ignored\n&gt;&gt; ones. Something like that would allow you to add the new functionality in a\n&gt;&gt; backwards compatible way.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; In ScalaTest, for example, I could later change the code above so it sends\n&gt;&gt; such a PendingDescription notification (though it would be a good long time\n&gt;&gt; before I did that because I wouldn&#39;t want to force people to upgrade their\n&gt;&gt; JUnit for a good while.)\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Bill\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; On Sat, Apr 16, 2011 at 1:13 PM, David Saff&lt;david@...&gt;  wrote:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; My current feeling is that the best thing to do is to somehow allow\n&gt;&gt;&gt; custom categories of test results. I&#39;m very reluctant to increase the\n&gt;&gt;&gt; number of built-in result categories, since such a change is one of\n&gt;&gt;&gt; the most likely to break, or at least be under-implemented, in IDEs\n&gt;&gt;&gt; and build frameworks.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; I&#39;m open to ideas about the best way to do this.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; David\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; On Thu, Apr 14, 2011 at 3:26 PM, lars.vonk&lt;lars.vonk@...&gt;  wrote:\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Hi,\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I would like to see progress in (acceptance) tests not yet implemented.
