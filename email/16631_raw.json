This is a wonderful feature given how hard it\nis to maintain test suites. However I&#39;m struggling to find documentation\nthat explains how to run these same tests from ant. So I have two questions\n\n1)       How do I run plain JUnit tests (without test suites) from Ant?\n\n2)       How do I run &quot;JUnit plug-in tests&quot; (without test suites) from Ant?\n\nConfused and feeling under documented\nMark in Ottawa\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n",
