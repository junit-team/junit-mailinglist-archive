Typically, the name of the test is enough<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; to describe what each test means. Why is that not the case for you?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;d like to share the result of my unit testing with upper<br/>\n&gt; management-type people.  testInsertTooLargeValue() doesn&#39;t mean much<br/>\n&gt; to them.  I&#39;d like a prose description like:  &quot;In this test, we try<br/>\n&gt; inserting a value into the table that is too large.  Depending on such<br/>\n&gt; and such, this should occur.  Or if not, then this should occur.  In<br/>\n&gt; either case, the code finally handlings this use case in blah blah<br/>\n&gt; blah manner.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Aha. I am wondering why upper management types are reading low-level <br/>\nprogrammer tests. Why do they want to read those tests?<br/>\n<br/>\nI am concerned with the expense of manually duplicating your test code <br/>\nin prose. If I knew what information they wanted, perhaps I could <br/>\nsuggest an alternative that is equally valuable to them, but much less <br/>\nprone to error than translating code into English by hand.<br/>\n<br/>\nHave you looked at Fit or FitNesse?<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJ.
