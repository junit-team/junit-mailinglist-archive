It would be helpful to have objective\nmeasures for the three factors I found. In my own practice I rely on\nintuition and experience to evaluate them.\n \nThinking aloud:\n  * Cost--you can certainly measure the runtime of tests, the number of\nlines of code required to set up the test, and the frequency with which the\ntest needs attention. These are all a posteriori measures, though. I&#39;m not\nsure how you would estimate them beforehand with any precision.\n  * Stability--again, this is possible to measure after the fact, but I\ndon&#39;t see how to estimate it objectively. Techniques like partial validation\nare helpful with interfaces that are likely to be unstable, like XML, PDF,\nor HTML.\n  * Reliability--and again, you could measure this after the fact by, for\nexample, tracing the execution of the code invoked by a test and counting\nthe number of conditionals and polymorphic messages. \n \nI&#39;ve given up on trying to objective about evaluating these factors. My gut\ngives me reasonable feedback in my daily work. If someone comes up with\neffective prediction, I&#39;d like to hear about it, though.\n \nRegards,\n \nKent Beck\nThree Rivers Institute\n\n  _____  \n\nFrom: junit@yahoogroups.com [mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com] On Behalf Of\nKamal Ahmed\nSent: Monday, September 22, 2008 5:52 PM\nTo: junit@yahoogroups.com\nSubject: Re: [junit] Where to test?\n\n\n\nKent,\n\nThis is fantastic. I could never put into words these concepts we struggle\nwith every day\nas eloquently.\nI would like to know though, how can we quantify all three factors.\nand do it in a fast and efficient way.\n\nThanks,\n-Kamal.\n\n----- Original Message ----\nFrom: kentb &lt;kentb@earthlink. &lt;mailto:kentb%40earthlink.net&gt; net&gt;\nTo: junit@yahoogroups. &lt;mailto:junit%40yahoogroups.com&gt; com\nSent: Monday, September 22, 2008 8:03:23 PM\nSubject: [junit] Where to test?\n\nAll,\n\nLast week on succeeding days I encountered two situations, one where\nsystem-level tests were valuable and unit tests would have been useless and\none where the reverse was true. Since simply the level of the tests is not\nsufficient to decide where to test, I thought a bit more about how I should\ndecide where to test. I came to three criteria:\n* The cost of writing and running the test\n* The stability of the interface the test is, errr..., testing\n* The reliability of the code satisfying the test\n\nI wrote this up in a little paper:\nwww.threeriversinst itute.org/ WhereToTest. html. Comments welcome.\n\nKent Beck\nThree Rivers Institute\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\n \n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n",
