Rainsberger wrote:\n&gt; David Saff wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Was your other piece of code going to be reused as heavily as JUnit is?\n&gt;\n&gt; Probably not. This was more about demonstrating a technique than\n&gt; anything else.\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Does that make a difference?\n&gt;\n&gt; I don&#39;t think it does. Do you?\n\nI think it does, but I&#39;m still figuring it out.  Cleverness in design \noften comes from metaphor: what if we could think of A as a kind of B?  \nWhat if we could think of a String as an iterable collection of lines?  \n(Ruby)  What if we could think of a flat panel as a spinnable wheel?  \n(iPod)  What if we could think of methods as test statements?  (JUnit)  \nWhat if we could think of basic blocks as runnable objects?  \n(Smalltalk)  By capitalizing on the similarity between something that \nlooks complex and something that we think we understand, we gain leverage.\n\nHowever, these metaphors are not without costs.  There are distinctions \nin the world, and the adaptations that must be made are not always \nintuitive.  If you look at all the Xunit descendants in the world, there \nare many different answers to simple questions: should one object be \ncreated for each method, or each class?  How can we identify _which_ \nmethods are tests?  Does it make sense to pass parameters to these test \nmethods?  All of these need answers to adapt the idea of &quot;test&quot; to the \nidea of &quot;method&quot;.  New users need time to &quot;get&quot; the basic metaphor, and \nthen additional time to learn, often by frsutrating trial and surprising \nerror, all of the gotchas.\n\nPluggable Selector, using reflection, is such a metaphor.  So, whether \nthe cost of this metaphor is worth it depends on the benefit each user \ngets, and how many uses that cost is to be amortized across.\n\nI&#39;m still figuring this out, and I&#39;m interested in your ideas.
