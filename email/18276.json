I guess<br/>\n&gt; you could code in all the skeleton of the class, with the methods &<br/>\n&gt; such (though this won&#39;t compile unless you really do return what you<br/>\n&gt; say you will), then write the tests, then add the rest of the code.<br/>\n&gt; But I don&#39;t see the great advantage of that, to be honest...<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I write the test, then use Eclipse to generate classes, interfaces and <br/>\nmethod stubs as I go. When the test compiles, I run it to watch it fail. <br/>\nThis way I know my test actually tests /something/. Only then do I make <br/>\nit pass.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I do this, I get the opportunity to see my code in black and white <br/>\non the screen. I get to ask myself, &quot;Is the design any good?&quot; or more <br/>\ncorrectly, &quot;Does the design suck in an obvious way?&quot; I&#39;m surprised how <br/>\noften it does. :) It&#39;s often not until I have to /use/ the API that I <br/>\nrealize it sucks.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo that&#39;s how I do it. I tried writing the skeleton code, then writing <br/>\nthe test, but I found I couldn&#39;t easily enough track in my head the code <br/>\nI needed for the test I wanted to write, so I decided to let the test <br/>\npull the code out of me. It works for me.<br/>\n<br/>\nTake care.<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJ. B.
