Here is the sitatution:\r\n&gt;&gt; \r\n&gt;&gt; \r\n&gt;&gt; \r\n&gt;&gt; Interface A   &lt;------implements---- GenericClassA\r\n&gt;&gt; \r\n&gt;&gt;      ^                                               ^\r\n&gt;&gt;      |                                                |\r\n&gt;&gt; \r\n&gt;&gt; extends                                     extends\r\n&gt;&gt; \r\n&gt;&gt;      |                                               |\r\n&gt;&gt; \r\n&gt;&gt;      |                                               |\r\n&gt;&gt; \r\n&gt;&gt; Interface B   &lt;------implements---- GenericClassB\r\n&gt;&gt; \r\n&gt;&gt; \r\n&gt;&gt; \r\n&gt;&gt; Given the above, I want to create a new class that extends\r\n&gt;&gt; &quot;GenericClassB&quot;, let&#39;s call it &quot;Foo&quot;.   \r\n\r\n&gt;I&#39;m going to use shorter names to make it easier for myself. :)\r\n\r\n&gt;Bad news: As far as I can see so far, no matter how you do this, you \r\n&gt;will have some runtime duplication in the tests. I would /really/ have \r\n&gt;to think about how to fix this.\r\n\r\n&gt;Foo extends BImpl implements B\r\n&gt;BImpl extends AImpl implements A\r\n\r\n&gt;Here&#39;s where I put the various tests:\r\n\r\n&gt;1. Tests for the contract of A go into Abstract Test Case ATestCase.\r\n&gt;2. Tests for the non-A behavior in AImpl go into Concrete Test Case \r\n&gt;AImplTest extends ATestCase. This way, AImplTest includes tests both for \r\n&gt;AImpl itself and how well it satisfies the contract of A.\r\n\r\n&gt;SIMILARLY...\r\n\r\n&gt;3. Tests for the contract of B go into Abstract Test Case BTestCase, \r\n&gt;which extends ATestCase to include the contract tests for both A and B.\r\n&gt;4. Tests for the non-B behavior in BImpl go into Concrete Test Case \r\n&gt;BImplTest which extends BTestCase.\r\n\r\n&gt;FINALLY...\r\n\r\n&gt;Tests for Foo-specific, non-B (and therefore non-A) behavior go into \r\n&gt;FooTest extends BImplTest. This way, FooTest inherits all the tests for \r\n&gt;the A and B interfaces.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn a quick review, this is what I&#39;ve identified as being missed.  If I have implemented tests for A in AImplTest, and BImplTest does not extend AImplTest, then I have to duplicate those tests in BImplTest.  Previously, I had BImplTest extend AImplTest and had an inner class in BImplTest (we&#39;ll call it BInnerTest) which extended BTestCase. \r\n\r\nOf course, that leads to my problem in FooTest as it extended BImplTest, but I didn&#39;t have a clean way to get the tests associated with BImplTest.BInnerTest.\r\n\r\nI should have included this in my previous message as it only took me a minute to figure out once I had my work laptop in front of me. :)\r\n\r\nIs there a way to further maximize the tests I&#39;m inheriting.  The problem above also leads me to the issue I spoke of related to overriding factory methods to return the right test fixture in FooTest.\r\n\r\nThanks again Joe,\r\n\r\nTom\r\n\r\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n",
