You can write all \nthe test cases here that should apply to any type of navigator.  And \nadd an abstract method to it such as:\n\n    public asbstract AbstractNavigator newTestInstance();\n\nNow, to test one of the concrete implementations (which I assume you \nplan to do! :-)), just write a test class as a subclass of \nAbstractNavigatorTest--mirroring the inheritance hierarchy. \nImplement \nthat method you declared and you&#39;re pretty much good to go!\n\nDoes that help?  I have an example which tests java.util.Set (an \ninterface) in this way--just ask and I will send it to you!\n\nKevin\n\n--- In junit@egroups.com, Coralee Allaby &lt;cvallaby@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; I&#39;ve been using JUnit to test my Java classes for a\n&gt; few weeks now.  I&#39;ve reached a problem that others\n&gt; have encountered as well.\n&gt; Here&#39;s the problem:\n&gt; I&#39;ve been asked, by my team leader, to write what&#39;s\n&gt; called an AbstractNavigator.  It doesn&#39;t matter what a\n&gt; Navigator is, the important point is that\n&gt; AbstractNavigator is an abstract class. This abstract\n&gt; class has a couple subclasses already (MDINavigator\n&gt; and TabbedPaneNavigator), and more will be written in\n&gt; the future.  \n&gt; We want to create unit tests (using JUnit, let&#39;s say\n&gt; AbstractUnitTest) which will apply to any\n&gt; AbstractNavigator.  Herein lies the problem.  I can&#39;t\n&gt; actually test the AbstractNavigator because I can&#39;t\n&gt; &quot;have a(n)&quot; AbstractNavigator since it&#39;s abstract. \n&gt; Therefore, I need to test a subclass of the\n&gt; AbstractNavigator, but currently, the only way I see\n&gt; of doing that (making the AbstractUnitTest &quot;have a&quot;\n&gt; MDINavigator) restricts the abstractedness of the unit\n&gt; tests.  The AbstractUnitTest could not be used without\n&gt; recompiling, a step to be avoided.\n&gt; Another method we&#39;ve thought of is to add a method\n&gt; &quot;getNavigator&quot; to the AbstractUnitTest which is called\n&gt; from the TestCase setUp() method.  This getNavigator\n&gt; method would only be implemented by subclassing the\n&gt; AbstractUnitTest class and would then return the\n&gt; specific type of AbstractNavigator to be tested (i.e.\n&gt; MDINavigator).  The problem with this solution is that\n&gt; the method of TestCase which returns the TestSuite is\n&gt; static and therefore cannot be overridden...where to\n&gt; go from here?\n&gt; \n&gt; If anyone can give us any more information about this\n&gt; kind of abstract unit testing, we would greatly\n&gt; appreciate it.\n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt; CJ\n&gt; \n&gt; __________________________________________________\n&gt; Do You Yahoo!?\n&gt; Yahoo!
