What I would like to do is use the Junit\n&gt; 4.1 annotation based testing and test suites. I have created several test\n&gt; classes and a test suite to run the test classes. Eclipse will run the\n&gt; annotation based Junit 4.1 test suite without error. When I try to run the\n&gt; new test suite on Anthill, they tests run correctly but the test names all\n&gt; appear as &#39;Unknown&#39;. I am at a loss to why.\n&gt;\n&gt; I have search Junit&#39;s and Anthill&#39;s documentation to no avail. Also I have\n&gt; initiated numerous searches on goggle, but I have not found anyone with a\n&gt; similar problem.\n&gt;\n&gt; Does anyone have any suggestions?\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks, -Michael-\n&gt; __________________________________________________________\n&gt; Check out the new AOL.
