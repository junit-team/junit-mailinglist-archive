Watch the eyes\n&gt; http://www.schuerig.de/michael/    --Ani DiFranco, Outta Me, Onto You\n\njUnit relies on a certain amount of implicit meta-data.  This is via\nthe naming of methods.  Making that meta-data explicit frees one from\nhaving to name tests in a certain way.  \n\nAlso, through annotations, one can test for exceptions without\ntry/catch/etc simply by declaring which exception(s) a test should return.\n\nBut the real reason is de-coupling.  With annotations you don&#39;t need\nto inherit from a framework (jUnit) class.  You simply annotate the\nclass and it becomes a TestCase.  This means you don&#39;t need to break\nout your tests into separate classes (though one is still free to do\nso).  To switch contexts entirely, its one of the reasons I like\nHibernate over Cayenne.  Both great, but Hibernate (unlike Cayenne and\nmost others) makes no requirements on the POJOs being persisted. \nThanks to annotations, nUnit has the same claim: any method in any\nclass can participate in unit testing.  This flexibility can lead to a\n more natural development style and more freedom for the developer.\n\n\n\n\n\n",
