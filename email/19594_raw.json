My point is just that I suspect you are\n&gt; only thinking of JUnit-based unit tests. And I would\n&gt; agree that 14 hours of unit tests seems pretty weird.\n\nThat&#39;s not quite what I&#39;m thinking, but it&#39;s closer. Certainly, I&#39;d be \nshocked to see 14 hours of fast tests, but even 14 hours of slow tests \non a single project is out of the ordinary. I can&#39;t envision a single \nproject that big. I&#39;d want to ask the people on that project two questions:\n\n1. Why such reliance on slow tests?\n2. Should we break this up into about four subprojects?\n\n&gt; But we&#39;re running JUnit-based system and acceptance\n&gt; tests. In my experience 14 hours of automated system\n&gt; testing isn&#39;t that unusual for a reasonably large and\n&gt; complex software system.\n\nI agree it isn&#39;t unusual (in the sense that it happens), but I would \nwant to look for improvement.\n\n&gt; Are they all valuable? Yes, I think so. They all have\n&gt; caught or could catch bugs. In fact, if we had time,\n&gt; we would write more tests that would take even longer\n&gt; to run, since I don&#39;t think we have the test coverage\n&gt; I&#39;d like.\n\nIs it really a good idea to have a test suite so long that you can&#39;t run \nit overnight between when people leave for work and when they come back \nin the morning? How do you do a daily build?\n\n&gt; As far as the speed of feedback for 14 hour tests, again\n&gt; these are system (&quot;QA&quot;) type tests. Comparing a 2 day\n&gt; feedback cycle to a 6 week feedback cycle (which is what\n&gt; we&#39;ve had on past projects) the 2 days is obviously a\n&gt; monumental step forward.\n\nNo question there. If you&#39;ve managed to reduce the feedback cycle from 6 \nweeks to 2 days, then that&#39;s great work. Still, I find a 2-day cycle \nquite long. I imagine you have bigger problems to face right now, so \nyou&#39;re right to face them and not this one, but all things being equal, \nI wouldn&#39;t be satisfied with a 2-day cycle, and I certainly wouldn&#39;t \ndesign JUnit to optimize for the case of the 2-day test cycle.\n\nBut that&#39;s great work. I&#39;m impressed. Have you written about what you do \ndifferently between the 6-week cycle and the 2-day cycle? I&#39;m sure \npeople would like to read about that.\n\nTake care.\n-- \nJ. B.
