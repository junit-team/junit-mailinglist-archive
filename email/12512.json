It has <br/>\na setAction() method which allows you to pass in a subclass instance for <br/>\ntesting purposes.  It still checks, however, that the object you pass in is <br/>\na valid subclass of whatever is specified in struts-config.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis seems to be a big need out there, since I have received no less than <br/>\n25-30 requests for this code since I posted something about in January.  So <br/>\nI guess I should put it up somewhere accessible.<br/>\n<br/>\nI just had our sysadmin post it.
