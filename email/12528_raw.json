It was pretty clear to me.\n\nE-mail can cause a lot of misunderstandi=\r\nngs, especially when one projects their\nown assumptions into what they are =\r\nreading.\n\n&gt; OK. Did you get the explanation you wanted? Sometimes the expla=\r\nnation \n&gt; takes pages and pages, and I don&#39;t have the energy to write that =\r\nout \n&gt; every time someone asks.\n\nThat is understandable.  But if you could =\r\npoint me to these pages then I would\nvoraciously consume them.  I have of c=\r\nourse read all the attached documentation\nthat comes with JUnit, and I have=\r\n been trying to make use of the JUnit-Addons\npackage.\n\n&gt; I apologize for my=\r\n tone. I was tired, and it seemed like you were asking \n&gt; for our advice, t=\r\nhen disregarding it anyway. You can understand how that \n&gt; might be enervat=\r\ning.\n\nSure, but it is also enervating when you are told to give it up when =\r\nyou know\nthat there is more to the story.\n\nI believe that I have found my o=\r\nwn answer.  At least here are my thoughts at the\nmoment.  Data driven testi=\r\nng in the way that I am trying to do it is not easily\nsupported in JUnit.  =\r\nThere is likely a reason for this, since a lot of thought\nhas gone into pro=\r\nducing JUnit.  I now believe that my approach is not in keeping\nwith JUnit.=\r\n  Since I am running the actual metadata from the application through\nthe t=\r\nest, I am doing more of a data driven functional type of testing.  A\nsoluti=\r\non that appears more consistent with JUnit and unit testing in general\nseem=\r\ns to be to make some mock metadata classes that are specially designed to\ne=\r\nxercise my code in the test.  This way my test is not dependent on any\nprod=\r\nuction code rather than the actual class that it is testing, and I am not\nt=\r\nrying to dynamically find all the production code and iterate through it al=\r\nl. \nInstead I am looking to carefully engineer my own metadata to exercise =\r\nmy tests.\n To implement this I basically wrote an abstract test class, and =\r\nthen made\nspecific subclasses that are each mainly concerned with building =\r\nspecific mock\ndata.  It is okay that this data is hardcoded rather than dyn=\r\namic because I am\nlooking to exercise the code by carefully building my own=\r\n data rather than\nrunning through all data that currently exists in the app=\r\nlication.  I was\nbasically being lazy by using data that already existed an=\r\nd not crafting my own.\nBut running actual production data does seem useful =\r\nat least a few times when\ntesting your own tests, just because there is som=\r\ne potential in catering to your\nown tests when writing your own data as wel=\r\nl.  Does that part make sense?  This\nis the only thing that feels strange a=\r\nbout my current ideas.  Am I on the right\ntrack?\n\nI know that there are man=\r\ny frustrations with dealing with a mailing list.  I\napplaud your taking the=\r\n time to answer people=92s questions, and feel very lucky\nto have the oppor=\r\ntunity to carry on a dialog with an expert.  Thanks so much for\nyour time g=\r\netting me past this hurdle.\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been =\r\nremoved]\n\n\n\n\n\n",
