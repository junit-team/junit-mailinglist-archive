And the latter also holds true for using classes from a <br/>\n&gt; com.sun package, or from a package that ends in &quot;.internal&quot;.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It&#39;s not at the same thing at all. Reflectively invoking methods is so <br/>\ninconvenient it discourages itself. By contrast you can use a class <br/>\nmarked internal or in the sun packages exactly like you use any other <br/>\nclass.<br/>\n<br/>\nLet me ask you this. How would you feel about making &quot;private&quot; just a <br/>\nsuggestion? i.e. why not allow anyone to invoke any private method from <br/>\nany class they want to? Of course, they would know when doing this that <br/>\nthey were doing something skanky. Would you be happy with such a <br/>\nlanguage? If not, why not? And why is a naming convention good enough to <br/>\nkeep packages and classes unpublished if it&#39;s not good enough to keep <br/>\nmethods unpublished?<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you think the private keyword should be just a suggestion, then I <br/>\nthink we will just have to agree to disagree at this point. But if you <br/>\ndon&#39;t think private is unnecessary, then I think there&#39;s a contradiction <br/>\nin your philosophy that&#39;s worth exploring further.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n﻿Elliotte Rusty Harold  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:elharo@...\">elharo@...</a><br/>\nXML in a Nutshell 3rd Edition Just Published!<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.cafeconleche.org/books/xian3/\">http://www.cafeconleche.org/books/xian3/</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0596007647/cafeaulaitA/ref=nosim\">http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0596007647/cafeaulaitA/ref=nosim</a></div>",
