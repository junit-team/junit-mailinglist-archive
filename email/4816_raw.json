Depends on how complex the files and\ndirectory structure needs to be, I suppose.  Having\nexplicit error messages about what is missing *is*\nvery helpful if you&#39;re relying on the files and/or\ndirectories being there already.\n\n-Eric\n\n--- Erik Hanson &lt;ehanson@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &quot;David V. Olivier&quot; &lt;dolivier@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; The rule of thumb is that unit tests should be as\n&gt; standalone as possible,\n&gt; &gt; and dependencies on external resources such as\n&gt; databases or files should be\n&gt; &gt; minimized or eliminated. [...] However, code does\n&gt; touch\n&gt; &gt; external resources at some point.  Shouldn&#39;t this\n&gt; be tested, and how?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Specifically, I have code that parses a xml\n&gt; catalog file and builds a\n&gt; &gt; catalog object structure.  I want to verify that\n&gt; the parsing works\n&gt; &gt; correctly.\n&gt; &gt; [...]\n&gt; &gt; But to do this test I do need some external\n&gt; resource, a simple catalog\n&gt; &gt; file.\n&gt; \n&gt; What I do in this case is embed the contents of the\n&gt; file in the test as a\n&gt; string constant and use that for testing.\n&gt; \n&gt; However, sometimes I think you do have to rely on\n&gt; external resources. For\n&gt; example, I wrote a Java class that iterates over all\n&gt; files in a directory and\n&gt; its subdirectories. To test it, I need to either\n&gt; have real files and\n&gt; direcotories, or somehow use mock objects to\n&gt; simulate the files and\n&gt; directories. But the class is simple enough that the\n&gt; thing I&#39;m really testing\n&gt; is that I understand correctly how Java&#39;s file I/O\n&gt; stuff works. So if I made a\n&gt; file I/O mock object, I&#39;d still want to write a test\n&gt; for it which uses real\n&gt; files and directories.\n&gt; \n&gt; My solution is to put really good error messages in\n&gt; my tests. &quot;Couldn&#39;t find\n&gt; file &#39;abc&#39;. (This test requires that the following\n&gt; directory structure exists:\n&gt; ...)&quot;.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Erik\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
