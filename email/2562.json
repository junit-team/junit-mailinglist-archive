As i&#39;ve dived into several specification documents (not comments about them), i&#39;ve discovered that OTS doesn&#39;t support directly nested transaction but only subtransaction (as you said). And JTS is based upon OTS. So it explains the &quot;nested transactions not required&quot;. About EJB 2.0 spec, it is written : &quot;no nested transactions supported&quot;. Authors explain that they want EJB spec to be implemented on any database system. They add that EJB spec could support nested transactions if databases support them [today, Oracle and Informix begin to do it via SavePoints].</font>\n<br>\n<br><font size=\"2\" face=\"sans-serif\">So a lot of my mail was wrong (shame on me :() but the conclusion :)) [Long live simple JDBC ! :)]</font>\n<br>\n<br><font size=\"2\" face=\"sans-serif\">Without enough &quot;normative oxygen&quot; to stay in spec documentation :) i&#39;ve discovered some research works that explains how to manage nested transaction with OMG database [http://citeseer.nj.nec.com/tesch97global.html (ODMG but works for OMG too)]. but it&#39;s another story...</font>\n<br>\n<br><font size=\"2\" face=\"sans-serif\">thanks Steven !</font>\n<br>\n<br><font size=\"2\" face=\"sans-serif\">regards,</font>\n<br>\n<br><font size=\"2\" face=\"sans-serif\">bruce.</font></div>",
