JUnit allows us change the approach of running testing (with JUnit 4 it supports annotation RunWith that allows you can change the runner of test). With the custom runner, you can load the remoting implementation by using URLClassLoader. Be sure that you use interface and appropriate code in test code for compiling and running test code.<br/>\n<br/>\nRegards,<br/>\nHai<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.haiphucnguyen.net/blog/\">http://www.haiphucnguyen.net/blog/</a><br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Bradley, Todd&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:todd.bradley@...\">todd.bradley@...</a>&gt; wrote:                                  Hi, we use JUnit to do some system testing (in addition to unit<br/>\n testing).  And even though I&#39;ve used JUnit every work day for the past 3<br/>\n years, I have a new problem I&#39;m not sure how to approach.<br/>\n <br/>\n I need to write some tests of a Java API that we&#39;re going to deliver to<br/>\n our customer.  And so my basic plan is to write some JUnit test cases<br/>\n that will interact with our product through this Java API, just as a<br/>\n customer would.  But I don&#39;t want to have any of our product source code<br/>\n checked out to do this.  Instead, I want my JUnit test case&#39;s setUp() to<br/>\n find the appropriate JAR file on a remote system, fetch it locally, and<br/>\n then start running tests against it.  That way, whenever the JAR file on<br/>\n the remote system (our system-under-test) changes, I know I&#39;ll be<br/>\n testing the latest API code.<br/>\n <br/>\n I&#39;ve got all the tools at hand to find and fetch the JAR file, but I&#39;m<br/>\n not sure what my approach should be to load the JAR at runtime AFTER my<br/>\n test (and thus the JVM it&#39;s running in) has already started.  Any advice<br/>\n for me?<br/>\n <br/>\n Todd.<br/>\n ----<br/>\n Todd Bradley - Polycom, Inc.<br/>\n ReadiVideo QA Lead<br/>\n <br/>\n     <br/>\n                       <br/>\n<br/>\n       <br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nLooking for a deal?
