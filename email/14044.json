The methods exposed by this class <br/>\ncannot be called randomly but by following some rules. For example, <br/>\nthere is a method &quot;Connect&quot; which must be invoked before any other <br/>\nmethod is called. There are additional calls that are related. For <br/>\nexample &quot;ChangeHeaders&quot; makes temporary change to some data (after <br/>\nsome business logic verification), however this must be followed by a <br/>\ncall to &quot;SaveChanges&quot; to persist this data. Whatever I have read<br/>\nabout <br/>\nJUnit seems to indicate that the test methods in my test class can be <br/>\ncalled in any order by the JUnit framework. Is there any way (a <br/>\npattern) to get around this issue ? Thanks much in advance..<br/>\n<br/>\nRegards,<br/>\nArnab.</div>",
