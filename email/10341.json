There seems to be a bug in the reporting of <br/>\nthose tests however, in that it will report a test run more than once even <br/>\nthough it really only runs it once.  I spent a few minutes stepping <br/>\nthrough the code to figure out where this behavior comes from but to no <br/>\navail (the truth is it wasn&#39;t worth my time).  I validated the tests <br/>\nweren&#39;t being run more than once though by putting breakpoints in the <br/>\ntests that were reported more than once -- the breakpoints only got hit <br/>\nonce.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Thu, 29 Jan 2004 12:25:31 -0000, ernsthlg &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ernsthlg@...\">ernsthlg@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Hello,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Is a tool out there, which generates suites for each package? Each<br/>\n&gt; suite should contain all tests of its package and all suites of the<br/>\n&gt; direct subpackages. Furthermore it should be able to update the<br/>\n&gt; relevant suites, if anywhere a new test was added.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I seek for such a tool, because i am going to intigrate TestCases one<br/>\n&gt; by one to an existing large project. For now only a few tests exist,<br/>\n&gt; but they are spread over all the packages. To be able to execute these<br/>\n&gt; tests i want a root-suite which contains all existing tests. But i<br/>\n&gt; don´t want to write suites for each package by hand.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thanks in advance,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Helge<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Yahoo!
