B. Rainsberger&quot; &lt;jbr@...&gt;\r\nReply-To: jbr@...\r\nX-Yahoo-Group-Post: member; u=89240252\r\nX-Yahoo-Profile: nails762\r\n\r\nIn the case of the sort method, let me say this: there are two\npossibilities: you wrote the sort methods or you didn&#39;t.\n\nSuppose you wrote the sort methods. That means that they have tests,\nand damn good ones. As a result, a method like this can&#39;t break on its\nown:\n\nif myCollection.size &lt; 20\n    myCollection.sortWith(SortAlgorithms.bubbleSort)\nelse if myCollection.size &lt; 100\n    myCollection.sortWith(SortAlgorithms.quickSort)\nelse\n    myCollection.sortWith(SortAlgorithms.mergeSort)\nend\n\nThis method does nothing except double-dispatch on myCollection, where\nI assume the sortWith method is defined like this:\n\ndef Collection.sortWith(sortAlgorithm)\n    sortAlgorithm.sortInPlace(myCollection)\nend\n\nThis method is clearly too thin to break *on its own*. It can only\nbreak if one of the SortAlgorithms is broken. As a result, don&#39;t test\nthis method. If you need to, test Collection.size, but otherwise,\nthere&#39;s nothing to gain from testing this method in particular.\n99.9999% of the time, the SortAlgorithms will work and you can&#39;t gain\nany more confidence by testing such simple use of the SortAlgorithms.\n\nOf course, you may not have written the Sort Algorithms. In that case,\nyou have a choice: assume they work, or write what I&#39;d call\nIDontTrustYou tests. These are tests of a third-party API that you\ndon&#39;t trust to work. Write tests that use representative samples of\ninput you expect to sort. Now that you know they work (or that they\ndon&#39;t), there is still nothing more to gain by testing the method up\ntop in this message. It&#39;s too thin to really break.\n\nEither way, I&#39;m suggesting you test the code that does the *real* work\nand not one-liners that simply call other code. (Notice that the if\nconstruct is essentially a one-liner calling three other one-liners.)\nWhen in doubt, try to dig down to find the class that does the\ninteresting stuff, and test *that* class the way you&#39;d test the current\nclass.\n\nHere&#39;s the acid test: ask yourself, can this method break on its own?\nIn other words: is it possible that everything this method calls can\nwork, while this method fails? What would have to happen for this\nmethod to break? If the logic of the current method is so simple that\nit doesn&#39;t end up on your list of ways the method could break, then\ntest the stuff your method calls, instead. This strategy reduces test\ncoupling and makes your code more refactoring-friendly without reducing\n(by much) your confidence in it.\n\n*********** REPLY SEPARATOR  ***********\n\nOn 2002-05-06 at 10:36 Daniel Barclay wrote:\n\n&gt;&gt; From: Berin Loritsch [mailto:bloritsch@...]\n&gt;&gt; ...\n&gt;&gt; * NEVER assume anything about the internals.
