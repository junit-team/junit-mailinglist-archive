I have multiple related tests and I am trying to execute them in a\nlogical flow. say\nTest1.run();\nif(Test1_result.wasSuccessful()){\n  Test2.run();\n  if(Test2_result.wasSuccessful()){\n    Test3.run();\n    Test4.run();\n    if(Test4_result.wasSuccessful()){\n      Test5.run();\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n#2. I wanted to call these test programmatically as mentioned above. \nSo I would like to give my own test name that are not starting with\ntest.  Since jUnit tester will pick up testXXX irrespective.\n\nHow to go about doing this? Have anyone encountered problem of this kind. \n\n~JAK\nPS: I can&#39;t use TestSuite becoz I wanted a logical flow in executing\nmy tests and not executing them in a specific order.\n\nOn 29 Mar 2005 16:49:46 -0000, junit Moderator\n&lt;junit-owner@yahoogroups.com&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Hello,\n&gt; \n&gt; Welcome to the JUnit group at Yahoo, a\n&gt; free, easy-to-use email group service.
