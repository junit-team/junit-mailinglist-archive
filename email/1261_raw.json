I&#39;ve been thinking that it might be handy to have\n&gt; assertGreater() and assertGreaterOrEqual() methods as well.  My first\n&gt; impulse is to subclass Assert and put them there.  Is there another\n&gt; (better) way to do this? Any ideas would be appreciated.  If anyone\n&gt; has done this before and would like to send me their code, that would\n&gt; be appreciated too ;)\n&gt; \n\nJust a thought... \n\nRather than using inheritance, you could define binary methods\n(functors) that are then used by the canonical assertion methods of the\nAssert class, as in\n\n    public class AssertRange {\n        public static boolean greaterThanOrEqual(int a, int b) {\n            return a &gt;= b;\n        }\n        public static boolean lessThanOrEqual(int a, int b) {\n            return a &lt;= b;\n        }\n    }\n\n    public void testSomething() {\n        assert(&quot;Test something&quot;, \n            AssertRange.greaterThanOrEquals(9, 10));\n    }\n\nThis may help promote pluggability of assertion behavior.\n\nThe other option would be to use composition rather than inheritance. \nThe AssertRange could delegate to the Assert class.\n\nMike\n\n=====\nMike Clark\nClarkware Consulting, Inc.\nCustom Software Architecture, Design, \nDevelopment, and Performance Consulting\nhttp://www.clarkware.com\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
