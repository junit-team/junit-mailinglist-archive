It is not practical to change the license for JUnit because of the difficult of identifying and notifying contributors. Commercial licenses are available and have been sold through Three Rivers Consulting, Inc. with terms crafted to meet your needs. Please have your lawyers contact me for details.<br/>\n<br/>\nBest regards,<br/>\n<br/>\nKent Beck<br/>\nThree Rivers Consulting, Inc.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Jan 13, 2011, at 12:49 AM, jaroslavtulach wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Hello JUnit guys.<br/>\n&gt; I know my post is going to sound silly, but I&#39;ll try anyway.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; We have new lawyers. Our new lawyers seem to be concerned about the JUnit license. True, JUnit&#39;s use of Common Public License is unique and sort of archaic. I don&#39;t know about any other (important) project using this license anymore.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Right now we are holding our release and getting ready to remove JUnit from our standard installation. Silly, I know, JUnit is necessary part of any serious Java development, but there is not much we can do. Except to ask:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Don&#39;t you want to relicense JUnit to some more commonly used license? EPL would be fine. At least I have not heard any complain about EPL from our new lawyers yet. Dual licensing to CPL & EPL probably too.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Thanks for reading my post and sorry for bothering. It just make me sad to see our software being crippled due to artificial licensing constraints.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; On behalf of about 800000 active users of NetBeans IDE,<br/>\n&gt; Jaroslav Tulach<br/>\n&gt; NetBeans Platform Architect<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed] </span></blockquote></div>",
