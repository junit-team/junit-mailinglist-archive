I failed miserably, which was probably due to me being really tired after a great conference I attended. So take my impressions with a grain of salt, but anyway here are they:</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>1. (good) the API is simple (few methods to implement)</div><div><br></div><div>2. Why is discoverTest of type void? I think it should really return some kind of collection of Tests/ a TestPlanSpecification, instead of getting a TestPlanSpecification passed in. The merging with other results of other engines should be task of the launcher</div><div><br></div><div>3. What is an Engine Descriptor, and why does my engine gets one passed as an argument??? My Engine really should know how to describe itself ... but wait an EngineDescriptor is some kind of TestDescriptor??? Is my engine a test? doesn&#39;t make sense to me. If it describes a test, then why has it an attribute isTest, which returns false by default?</div><div><br></div><div>4. Why is there an execute method in a TestEngine? If a TestEngine is something (possibly) provided by a third party, it should not execute tests. It should register them (along with all necessary and possible meta information) and the core of JUnit should execute them.</div><div><br></div><div>5. How is the ReflectionUtils supposed to work?  I tried <span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);font-family:Consolas;background-color:rgb(228,228,255);\">findAllClassesInPackage and </span><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);font-family:Consolas;background-color:rgb(228,228,255);\">findAllClassesInClasspathRoot, but didn&#39;t to manage to get anything out of them, except null.</span></div><div><br></div><div>6. As mentioned above, I&#39;m too stupid (or was too tired) to make it work. If somebody wants to take a look, the poor results are in <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://github.com/schauder/junit-lambda/tree/lambda-engine\">https://github.com/schauder/junit-lambda/tree/lambda-engine</a><br></div><div><br></div><div>kind regards</div><span class=\"ygrps-yiv-1719434304HOEnZb\"><font color=\"#888888\"><div>Jens</div><div></div></font></span></div>\n</div><br></div></div>",
