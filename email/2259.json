These tests, written<br/>\n&gt;with HTTPUnit, are getting painful.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Paul, that does sound painful.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy experience:  I like to just test some core functionality over http to <br/>\nmake sure nothing major has been broken on a page.  I&#39;m taking about tests <br/>\nsuch as making sure a user can login or making sure a user can&#39;t reach a <br/>\ncertain page unless they login, or aspects of any complicated registration <br/>\nsystem... those kinds of things.  I&#39;ve never considered testing to make <br/>\nsure links work or the title of the page is just so.  Designers redesign, <br/>\nand marketing like to change wording... and they should be able to do that <br/>\nwithout me changing my tests.  That&#39;s my feeling.<br/>\n<br/>\nRegarding the cost of these tests: how bad is it if the page title is <br/>\nwrong?  Is it worth N developer days?  These are questions for you/your <br/>\nmanagement to ponder.  For me, it&#39;s bad if, say, the login logic doesn&#39;t <br/>\nwork: that&#39;s worth testing.   A page title error isn&#39;t the end of the <br/>\nworld.  But of course, your situation may be very different.<br/>\n<br/>\nStill...if you have a lot of dynamic text which needs to be checked (maybe <br/>\ncoming from a struts resource file, resource bundle, or similar) then <br/>\nperhaps you can make those tests less-painful by working out a way to test <br/>\nthem without making http request (i.e., move them into classes somehow).<br/>\n<br/>\nStupid thought for the day: if you&#39;re trying to &quot;lock down&quot; some pages, <br/>\ncould you do something quick and dumb like compute a hash value/checksum <br/>\nfor the whole HTML page and test against that value? :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nRegards<br/>\nRichard</div>",
