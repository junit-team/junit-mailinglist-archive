I run every test every time I\nbuild!\nI think about the code while it&#39;s building (even code sometimes)! This gives me every assert I\nneed on any class wrote every time I build my code ... I think that&#39;s continuous integration.\n\nThere is no substitute to hard-work.\n\nPlease comment !\n\n--Neo\n\n\n\n--- &quot;J. B. Rainsberger&quot; &lt;jbr@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; So said  Vikas Malla  on  2002-11-24 \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;This discussion has been exactly what I have been looking for a while.\n&gt; &gt;Continuing this further, I woud like to bring the question of\n&gt; development\n&gt; &gt;overheads involved.\n&gt; &gt;1) What efforts have you guys taken in your respective organizations\n&gt; to\n&gt; &gt;reduce the programming overhead associated with writing unit tests? \n&gt; \n&gt; I consider the exercise of writing tests to have its own merit; I do\n&gt; not consider it overhead. When tests are expensive to write, I\n&gt; encourage everyone to take whatever time is necessary to discover the\n&gt; design improvement that we&#39;re all missing. On most projects, the cost\n&gt; is recovered.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;2) What are the tools you use for creation of unit tests, if any?\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m not sure what you mean here. If you are talking about automatically\n&gt; generating tests or even test skeletons, I don&#39;t believe in it. TDD is\n&gt; a human activity.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;3) Do you prefer using tools for unit tests creation?\n&gt; \n&gt; See my answer to (2)\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;4) We use JBuilder in our development efforst. What would you advise\n&gt; us to\n&gt; &gt;go for to reduce our development overheads associated with unit tests?\n&gt; \n&gt; I am not (yet) familiar with JBuilder, so I cannot comment. If JBuilder\n&gt; helps you, then continue using it; otherwise, stop.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;5) What do you guys think of cactus?\n&gt; \n&gt; I have never used Cactus. I prefer to test outside the container.\n&gt; \n&gt; J. B.
