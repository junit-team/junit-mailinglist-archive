I tried searching the archives, but found nothing applicable. If\nthis is an old topic, I would appreciate a pointer to the thread...\n\n \n\nBackground:\n\nI have written several derivatives of java.io.InputStream and test cases\nthat go along with them. However, during a recent peer review of the\ncode, we discovered an inconsistency between the contract of one of the\nmethods in java.io.InputStream and my implementation of that same method\nin the specialized subclass.\n\n \n\nProblem:\n\nI would like to have a set of functional tests (black-box style) that\nenforce the behaviors of the super class, java.io.InputStream. Then use\nthat same set of tests to ensure that the basic contracts for each of\nthe classes I write follow that contract (i.e. pass those generic\ntests). Does anyone have a suggestion for doing this? While this\nspecific example pertains to java.io.InputStream the same scenario may\noccur with any class hierarchy.\n\n \n\nEnvironment:\n\nI use Ant to compile and run my tests, so ideally any solution will be\ncompatible with the &lt;batchtest&gt; mechanism or otherwise allow for the\ndynamic (read, &quot;automatic&quot;) addition of new tests.\n\n \n\nThanks,\n\n \n\nJosh\n\n \n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n",
