That&#39;s what class invariants are for. Each public\n&gt; &gt; method is atomic. It is invoked when an object is any legal\n&gt; &gt; state and when the method returns it is always careful to\n&gt; &gt; leave the object in one of the legal states (barring bad\n&gt; &gt; synchronization and complicated multithreaded issues).\n&gt;\n&gt; That&#39;s not what I was saying.  I am sure your code won&#39;t crash if the\n&gt; method is called without these prerequisites, it&#39;s just that it won&#39;t be\n&gt; doing anything useful (no-op or throwing an exception), so testing it in\n&gt; these conditions will be useless:  you need to set up these prerequisites\n&gt; before you invoke the method.\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; However, a situation where public method A must be\n&gt; &gt; invoked before method B is a code smell.\n&gt;\n&gt; I see code like this every day, and it&#39;s not a code smell to me.\n&gt;\n&gt; It&#39;s just what a program is about:  the logical execution of statements in\n&gt; a certain order.  Run them in a different order and the program no longer\n&gt; does what it&#39;s supposed to do.\n\nThat&#39;s a different issue, though. That the program has different \neffects if method calls are reordered is one thing; that the program \nfails *internally* if they&#39;re reordered is another.\n\nFor example, consider a Jena RDF Model object (which can be usefully\nthough of as a set of (S P O) statements, where S P and O are Resources\nnamed by URIs [1]).  You can .add(S P O) and .remove(S&#39; P&#39; O&#39;) to\nyour heart&#39;s content, with different S&#39;s and P&#39;s and O&#39;s, and the\nModel will eat it all up; you can invoke the methods in any order\nyou like.\n\nNow, for whatever effect you *want*, there&#39;s probably a best ordering,\nand lots of broken orderings. Nevertheless, each sequence of add/remove\ncalls is well-defined [2] - there&#39;s no &quot;you must do X to allow Y&quot;\ncircumstances. \n\n[1] S and O can also be &quot;blank&quot;, ie non-named, Resources, and O can\n    can be a literal value, but that doesn&#39;t affect this discussion.\n\n[2] Well, a model might be immutable, in which case the well-definition\n    is a bit boring - it throws an exception on the first mutation.\n\n-- \nChris &quot;electric hedgehog&quot; Dollin\n&quot;The compiler is free to insert padding because it makes the struct \nlook bigger and scares away predators.&quot; [Keith Thompson, comp.lang.c]\n\n\n",
