But what advantage does having three<br/>\nentities, rather than just two, give you? Well, I suppose that you<br/>\ncan have a bunch of test cases sharing common setup/teardown code,<br/>\nbut I&#39;m not sure that you need this to be something separate than a<br/>\nTestSuite, since a TestSuite uses the composite pattern anyway, and so<br/>\ncan aggregate instances of itself.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust as a data point, here are Robert V. Binder&#39;s definitions of some of<br/>\nthese terms, from the glossary of _Testing Object-Oriented Systems_:<br/>\n<br/>\n    test. (1) An activity in which a system or a component is executed<br/>\n\tunder specified conditions, the results are observed or recorded,<br/>\n\tand an evaluation is made of some aspect of the system or component.<br/>\n\t... (3) A set of one or more test cases. (4) A set of one or more<br/>\n\ttest procedures. (5) A set of one or more test cases and procedures<br/>\n\t[IEEE 610]<br/>\n<br/>\n    test case.  A set of inputs, execution conditions, and expected<br/>\n\tresults developed for a particular objective. A representation or<br/>\n\timplementation that defines a pretest state of the IUT and its<br/>\n\tenvironment, test inputs or conditions, and the exepcted result.<br/>\n<br/>\n    test suite.  (1) A related collection of test cases. A collection<br/>\n        of test case sequences that serve a particular testing goal for<br/>\n        a particular version of an IUT. A whole-part relationship exists<br/>\n        among test cases. ...<br/>\n<br/>\n(IEEE 610 is the _ANSI/IEEE standard 610.12-1990: glossary of software<br/>\nengineering terminology._)<br/>\n<br/>\nSo according to this terminology, I&#39;d use<br/>\n<br/>\n    TestSuite (1) ---&gt; (n) TestCase<br/>\n<br/>\nor perhaps, if I found a good reason to<br/>\n<br/>\n    Test (1) ---&gt; (n) TestSuite (1) ---&gt; (n) TestCase<br/>\n<br/>\nThe current terminology actually caused me several years of confusion,<br/>\nthough I understand it now.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, I&#39;ve gotten used to other things, such as consistently refering<br/>\nto developer tests as the &quot;unit tests,&quot; even though any major XP project<br/>\nI&#39;ve worked on has had quite a few developer tests that were not unit<br/>\ntests and--though fewer--unit tests that were not developer tests. So<br/>\nI suppose I&#39;ll eventually get used to this, too. Still, it would be<br/>\nnice if this followed what appears to me to be fairly standard testing<br/>\nterminology. (Sorry, I&#39;m not an expert on testing, so I may be wrong<br/>\nabout this.)<br/>\n<br/>\ncjs<br/>\n-- <br/>\nCurt Sampson  &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:cjs@...\">cjs@...</a>&gt;   +81 90 7737 2974   <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.NetBSD.org\">http://www.NetBSD.org</a><br/>\n    Don&#39;t you know, in this new Dark Age, we&#39;re all light.  --XTC</div>",
