It turns out (and apologies to those of you who already know this) \nthat protected members are visible to all other classes in the same \n_package_ as well as any subclasses, which I spent quite a lot of yesterday \nvehemently refuting, until I had the language definition shoved under my nose.\n\nAnyway, I thought I&#39;d share my humiliating defeat with you because it \nprovides a nice solution to the problem of testing protected methods - you \njust test them from a test class within the same package.  (I really like \nthe earlier suggestion of having the test cases in the same package but a \ndifferent directory - hadn&#39;t occurred to me before.)\n\nNow this is only my own development practice, but I tend to use: public \naccess for, umm, public methods, protected for methods which I expect to be \noverridden by subclasses (and probably made public), or which I expect to \nbe used by subclasses, and private methods purely as helpers for public or \nprotected methods elsewhere in the class, which means these private methods \ncan be tested indirectly anyway by testing combinations of the other methods.\n\nHope that helps,\nDan.\n\n\nAt 06:40 23/05/2001 -0400, you wrote:\n&gt;FWIW, Test Mentor (www.silvermark.com) gives you transparent access to\n&gt;private and protected methods and fields regardless of which package your\n&gt;tests are in.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n&gt;Mike Silverstein                        voice:  (919) 858-8300 x29\n&gt;SilverMark, Inc.                        fax:    (919) 858-8308\n&gt;5511 Capital Center Drive               mobile: (919) 669-5906\n&gt;Suite 510, Raleigh, NC 27606            toll free: (888) 588-0668\n&gt;http://www.silvermark.com               msilverstein@...\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; &gt; From: Bhavaniprasad Polimetla\n&gt; &gt; [mailto:bhavaniprasad.polimetla@...]\n&gt; &gt; Sent: Wednesday, May 23, 2001 4:55 AM\n&gt; &gt; To: junit@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; &gt; Subject: Re: [junit] How to test protected and private methods/ fields?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Jens Andersen wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Hi all,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; First of all I have to mention that I&#39;m pretty novice when it\n&gt; &gt; comes to use\n&gt; &gt; &gt; JUnit for writing unittests. But I have a question which I hope\n&gt; &gt; some of you\n&gt; &gt; &gt; can help me with - it&#39;s regarding testing private/protected\n&gt; &gt; methods and how\n&gt; &gt; &gt; to organize my test package.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; First the package. I have read to articles regarding test (&quot;Junit best\n&gt; &gt; &gt; practices&quot; from JavaWorld and &quot;Incremental development with Ant\n&gt; &gt; and JUnit&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; from developerWorks). In the JBT article Andy Schneider advice\n&gt; &gt; you to keep\n&gt; &gt; &gt; tests in the same location as the source code. And in the Incremental...\n&gt; &gt; &gt; article Malcolm Davis advice you to make a separate package.\n&gt; &gt; Which approach\n&gt; &gt; &gt; is the best to use?\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; it is better to make separate package. when we can identify as\n&gt; &gt; two separate\n&gt; &gt; components like source code and test code it is better to keep them as two\n&gt; &gt; different components from configuration management point of view.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I must admit that I like the idea of making a separate package but then\n&gt; &gt; &gt; again - how do I then test private and protected methods? And\n&gt; &gt; if I keep the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; tests in the same location as the source code - who do I then\n&gt; &gt; test private\n&gt; &gt; &gt; methods?\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; we cant test private and protected methods directly.\n&gt; &gt; we need to find the public methods, which are using those\n&gt; &gt; protected and private\n&gt; &gt; methods and test that public methods is enough. Still it is not\n&gt; &gt; sufficient.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; one thing the developer can do is, he can change the private and\n&gt; &gt; protected to\n&gt; &gt; public and test them. after that he can change back to private\n&gt; &gt; and protected\n&gt; &gt; respectively. but this is not that much good idea.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; still we need to find the exact way.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I would very much appreciate if some of you could give me a\n&gt; &gt; little example\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Kind regards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; J.
