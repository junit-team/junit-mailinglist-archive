Simply because you must have a<br/>\nstable source tree to develop (I think everyone agrees on that).  But how can<br/>\nyou tell if your tree is stable?  Some would say &quot;if it compiles&quot; but I would<br/>\nadd &quot;and if the tests pass&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would sell the &quot;continuous integration&quot; tool not as an Agile tool, but simply<br/>\nas a source tree integrity checker.  Of course don&#39;t knock on the door of your<br/>\nmanager and tell him that he has no clue, that we must go agile and that&#39;s how<br/>\nwe will go there. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nI prefer to first use the tools and then go agile.  If you first use JUnit then<br/>\nrefactoring then continuous integration, you will IMO also become agile.  More<br/>\nslowly I agree, but IMO with less friction (if you are in an &quot;non-agile&quot;<br/>\norganization).<br/>\n<br/>\n-Vladimir<br/>\n\r<br/>\n--<br/>\nVladimir Bossicard<br/>\nwww.bossicard.com</div>",
