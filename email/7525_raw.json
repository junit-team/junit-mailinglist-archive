EJB&#39;s are =\r\nan as yet immature technology, in much the same way that JSP was when it fi=\r\nrst came out. Given a few more years and much cogitation, I&#39;m sure that the=\r\ny can be fixed or replaced with something better.\n\nI saw in a recent report=\r\n on the SD conference that Scott Ambler led a panel discussion where the en=\r\ntire panel (including a Sun engineer) expressed disappointment with Entity =\r\nEJB&#39;s.\n\nI remember being really excited when I first heard of EJBs, but the=\r\n more I try to learn about them, the more I find myself shying away from th=\r\nem.\n\nSimon\n\n&gt;-----Original Message-----\n&gt;From: J.

We\n&gt;&gt; looked at Cactus and played with it a bit and were put off by s=\r\nome of\n&gt;the\n&gt;&gt; effort involved in making it work.  You have to address \n&gt;va=\r\nrious client\n&gt;vs\n&gt;&gt; server deployment issues, it seems confusiong wrt what =\r\ncode is\n&gt;executed in\n&gt;&gt; the client vs the server ,etc.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;We decided =\r\nnot to devote that level of effort to Cactus just yet and\n&gt;&gt; instead are wr=\r\niting unit tests that act as clients to the session\n&gt;beans\n&gt;&gt; and testing t=\r\nhem in that manner using the normal test runner.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;It&#39;s not clear to=\r\n me what the disadvantages are to this approach.\n&gt;&gt; Comments?\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I&#39;=\r\nve found no significant disadvantages to using this approach to\n&gt;&gt; testing =\r\nremotely-accessible methods of EJB components.  Then again,\n&gt;when\n&gt;&gt; I do u=\r\nse EJBs it&#39;s only to &quot;front&quot; a non-EJB component that can be\n&gt;&gt; tested outs=\r\nide of an EJB container.  That is, the EJB is strictly\n&gt;&gt; conduit.  So I gu=\r\ness I use the approach you mention for integration\n&gt;&gt; testing, if that dist=\r\ninction matters.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; IMO, Cactus is great, if you absolutely must test fr=\r\nom within the\n&gt;&gt; container.
