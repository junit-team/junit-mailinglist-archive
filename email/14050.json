I have written a<br/>\n&gt; library<br/>\n&gt; of which I need to test one class. The methods exposed by this class<br/>\n&gt; cannot be called randomly but by following some rules. For example,<br/>\n&gt; there is a method &quot;Connect&quot; which must be invoked before any other<br/>\n&gt; method is called. There are additional calls that are related. For<br/>\n&gt; example &quot;ChangeHeaders&quot; makes temporary change to some data (after<br/>\n&gt; some business logic verification), however this must be followed by a<br/>\n&gt; call to &quot;SaveChanges&quot; to persist this data. Whatever I have read<br/>\n&gt; about<br/>\n&gt; JUnit seems to indicate that the test methods in my test class can be<br/>\n&gt; called in any order by the JUnit framework. Is there any way (a<br/>\n&gt; pattern) to get around this issue ?

Each test method should<br/>\nbe unrelated to the others - otherwise it&#39;s too hard to eg move<br/>\nthem around for greater expressivity, call only the failing when<br/>\nwhen you want to isolate a problem, &co.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are at least two things you can do:<br/>\n<br/>\n(a) Ensure that each test uses its own object (easy) and that it<br/>\n    runs the piece of lifecycle you&#39;re interested in to <br/>\n    completion.<br/>\n<br/>\n(b) Refactor so that this object-state dependency is reduced<br/>\n    (preferably to zero).<br/>\n<br/>\nFor (b) I&#39;d start by fixing the `connect` problem: if nothing<br/>\ncan be done withotu a connection, I&#39;d have a more factory-like<br/>\nobject with a `connect` method; calling this delivers a connected<br/>\nobject.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor Change/Save, I&#39;d just have the test do the Change and then<br/>\nthe Save in the same testXXX() method.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nChris &quot;electric hedgehog&quot; Dollin<br/>\nIt&#39;s called *extreme* programming, not *stupid* programming.</div>",
