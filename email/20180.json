    "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1162974002\">Hi all, <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve been stuck with a problem, when i&#39;m unit testing my code. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy problem is that i&#39;ve a really huge method,which calls several small<br/>\nmethods ( methods so small, they&#39;re just getters for member<br/>\nvariables), If i have to unit test this method, i&#39;ve to make sure all<br/>\nthe small methods that it subsequently invoke, work as they&#39;re<br/>\nexpected. But all my member variables get initialized seperately in a<br/>\ndifferent method which is of no relation with the BIG method I wanted<br/>\nto test in the first place. <br/>\n<br/>\nCan I test my method without worrying about the initialization of my<br/>\nobject&#39;s data, by mocking the results of all my getter methods ?  <br/>\n<br/>\nEx: <br/>\n<br/>\nClass MyClass<br/>\n{<br/>\n   private Object _member; <br/>\n   public void initialize()<br/>\n   {<br/>\n     //huge initialization process, which initializes my member<br/>\nvariables. <br/>\n      _member = new Object(); <br/>\n   }<br/>\n<br/>\n   public void myHugeMethod()<br/>\n   {<br/>\n       //.. my logic here.<br/>\n       Object m = getMember(); <br/>\n       //... proceed with this value. <br/>\n   }<br/>\n<br/>\n   public Object getMember()<br/>\n   {<br/>\n      return this._member; <br/>\n   }<br/>\n}<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, if I call &#39;myHugeMethod()&#39; without calling &#39;initialize()&#39; method,<br/>\nit always return NULL. <br/>\n<br/>\nAll i wanted to do is to test &#39;myHugeMethod()&#39;, by mocking<br/>\n&#39;getMember()&#39; method and setting the result what i wanted. <br/>\n<br/>\nI tried using Jmock for creating mocks in my test case, but it fails<br/>\nbecause the mock object only knows what exactly I wanted to mock but<br/>\nnothing more than that. All my application logic is present in<br/>\n&#39;MyClass&#39; object not in its mock. <br/>\n<br/>\nHow can I achieve this using Jmock ? <br/>\n<br/>\nFYI, I tried with a direct approach by extending &#39;MyClass&#39; and<br/>\noverriding the &#39;getMember()&#39; method in it. But I still feel there&#39;s a<br/>\nbetter way to do it. <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ll be very thankful for any help in this regard.. <br/>\n<br/>\nThanks in advance, <br/>\nSarat kumar.</div>",
