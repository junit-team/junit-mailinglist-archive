Is there a way to get<br/>\n&gt; around this issue? More specifically; is it possible to execute all<br/>\n&gt; assertions in a test function despite some have failed.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I attempted using JFunc, but it is slightly incomplete. Other than<br/>\n&gt; this extension, I have had little luck finding anything else.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Cheers!<br/>\n&gt; -Raffie-<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>A long time ago, put in almost the same situation (having multiple assertions with different results <br/>\non same test) I have patched the Assert class behavior in the following way:<br/>\n- first things in the test method you set the behavior of the assertion (fail on assert, continue on <br/>\nfailed assertion, defaulting to JUnit general behavior)<br/>\n- with the 2nd type of behavior having all the failures reported at the end of the method<br/>\n<br/>\nThe only thing I have missed at that point was that the total numbers where screwed :-).<br/>\n<br/>\nI will not dive into the discussion if this was bad or good, cause I cannot remember the whole <br/>\nthing. All I remember is what I have done :-).<br/>\n<br/>\ntake care,<br/>\n:alex |.::the_mindstorm::.|</div>",
