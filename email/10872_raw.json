I am\n&gt; running several .class tests in my suite() and I would like to have\n&gt; some flexibility as far as running different subsets of tests. I have\n&gt; created a &quot;TestClient&quot; with a main that collects command line\n&gt; arguments to know what subset of parametrized tests to run. I&#39;d also\n&gt; like to include &quot;levels&quot; of testing. Basically, I&#39;d like to be able\n&gt; to run certain sets of tests based on a command line parameter.\n&gt; eg.) java TestClient &lt;-detailed | -normal | -brief &gt;\n&gt; The only option I can seem to think of is to have the suite add tests\n&gt; by methodName and do so conditionally (based on a static global\n&gt; variable).\n&gt; \n&gt; if(detailed){\n&gt;    suite.addTest(newTestClient(&quot;testItemA&quot;))\n&gt; }\n&gt; \n&gt; The problem with this is that I&#39;d have to list every single\n&gt; testMethod for the test. Instead, I&#39;d like to add the tests to the\n&gt; suite as .class files and use any another approach. Can anyone think\n&gt; of anything? Any suggestions out there?\n\nIt sounds like you could reuse the Ant &lt;junit&gt;/&lt;batchtest&gt; tags somehow. \nCould you rebuild your TestClient to run Ant in embedded mode and \ngeneral a target on the fly? I&#39;ve never tried it, but it might be very \nsimple. Ask around on Ant mailing lists about invoking Ant tasks \nprogrammatically.\n-- \nJ. B.
