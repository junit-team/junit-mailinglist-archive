It can provide many benefits and by the same time not <br/>\nhaving all the side effects that JUnit and TDD have. Examples are <br/>\nEiffel and Java Modelling Language (JML).<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy? How? I&#39;ll explain.<br/>\n<br/>\nTesting of the code (methods) can be done with precondition, <br/>\ninvartiants and postconditions (the contracts). Thats how I <br/>\nunderstand Design by Contract. You write your method definition and <br/>\nthen you write the contract for it. Then you implement your method. <br/>\n<br/>\nNow the great thing: When you compile your code the implementation <br/>\ncan be checked whether it obeys the contract. If not, a compile error <br/>\nis thrown. That it! No JUnit test needed! Not TDD needed! Besides <br/>\nthis, a contract serves as a documentation. And it can use invariants <br/>\nwhich JUnit will always lack of.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow come on and don&#39;t tell me: &quot;We always used JUnit, most people do, <br/>\nwhy do you little inexperienced programer think you have a better <br/>\nidea than people like Gamma or Fowler?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI am not satisfied with the JUnit and TDD &quot;paradigma&quot;. They are <br/>\noriginated because of a *poverty* in Java programing language. If <br/>\nJava would support proper Design by Contract and a compiler for that <br/>\nthan no one would bother with JUnit and TDD.</div>",
