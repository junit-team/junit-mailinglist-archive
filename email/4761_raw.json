Something along t=\r\nhese \n&gt; lines: [...]\n\nFunctional testing:\n\n&gt; Several options are available =\r\nbased on what your testing environment\n&gt; 1), 2), 3) [...]\n\nFor unit testing=\r\n you would probably want your tests to exercise very\nspecific parts of the =\r\ncode, and therefore, you want the least\ninteraction possible with outside o=\r\nbjects (see example below).  Patterns\nlike self-shunt and Mock objects are =\r\nwell suited to this type of testing\n(search archives for more info).\n\nWith =\r\nfunctional testing you want to exercise specific test\ncases/scenarios, with=\r\nin a specific environment.  Setting up a known\ndirectory structure with jar=\r\ns and checking the results would be a valid\nfunctional test.\n\nLEAST INTERAC=\r\nTION EXAMPLE:\nToday I ran into a problem reading in files on a Solaris OS. =\r\n The\napplication was running fine on windows, but as soon as it was moved t=\r\no\nthe Solaris platform, some records were getting corrupted.  The data we\nw=\r\nere processing was a set of Spanish addresses, and contained extended\nchara=\r\ncters.  We tracked the problem down to character mapping conversion\nproblem=\r\ns.  The lesson learnt is:  the problem came from environment\nsettings.  The=\r\n actual application worked fine, given the appropriate\ninput (i.e. Mocking =\r\nup the InputStream).  The problem came with the\nenvironment settings.\n\nHTH,=\r\n\n\nManuel Amago.\nmailto:mamago@...\n\n\n",
