My development team depends on JUnit.  I&#39;d<br/>\n&gt; rather have fewer new features that are well designed and developed<br/>\n&gt; than many features that are poorly designed and implemented.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; - If you are going to transfer control to the community, why<br/>\n&gt; not &quot;Community Planning Game&quot;.  That is, implement the XP Planning<br/>\n&gt; Game where the community is the customer.  The community could<br/>\n&gt; express what they desire (stories) and set priorities.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; - Providing hooks for extensions would be great.  Right now, the most<br/>\n&gt; frequently use hook is subclassing.  Unfortunately this makes it<br/>\n&gt; difficult to use two extensions at once.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; - Greg<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --- In junit@y..., &quot;Johannes Link&quot; &lt;john.link@g...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; 2. JUnit as a political gesture celebrates the ability of<br/>\n&gt; programmers<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; to test their own software. The code and tests must be held to a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; higher standard, to demonstrate the techniques necessary to uphold<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; our end of the bargain.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;d like to add two aspects:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; - JUnit should be the stable angle for the very unstable projects<br/>\n&gt; we all<br/>\n&gt; &gt; have to do. Changing too much jeopardizes stableness.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; - When adding too much non-core functionality one quickly looses<br/>\n&gt; focus of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the core parts. Very often the extra functionality is not exactly<br/>\n&gt; what I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; need in a specific situation, so I have to reimplement it anyway.<br/>\n&gt; If the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; unneeded and unwanted part of a tool is prevailing many will move<br/>\n&gt; towards<br/>\n&gt; &gt; starting from scratch with a new (small) framework. That&#39;s why I&#39;d<br/>\n&gt; rather<br/>\n&gt; &gt; have JUnit as a core with hooks to plug in additional behaviour<br/>\n&gt; which is<br/>\n&gt; &gt; available in additional tools.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; BTW, is the move to version 4 as described in<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?JunitNextRelease\">http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?JunitNextRelease</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; an &quot;official&quot; thing, i.e. promoted by Kent and Erich?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Johannes<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\">junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
