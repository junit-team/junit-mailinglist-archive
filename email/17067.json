In a method the static initializer calls, I add the package<br/>\nname onto the class path. But because the class path now had two<br/>\nclasspaths separated with a semi colon, the full directory name was<br/>\ninvalid. <br/>\n<br/>\nI have resolved it by splitting the classpath around semicolons and<br/>\nlooping through each classpath.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nRegards,<br/>\n<br/>\nChris<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",
