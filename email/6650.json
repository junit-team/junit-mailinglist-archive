I searched the archives<br/>\nof this list, and Google, but to no avail (granted I haven&#39;t tried too<br/>\nhard).<br/>\n<br/>\nHere is what is tickling my brain:<br/>\n  I have the feeling that this is a classloader issue, as is typical<br/>\nwith the JUnit Swing GUI.  You didn&#39;t mention: whether it worked using<br/>\nthe AWT and Text Runners; nor which version of JUnit you are using.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, in line with what I say above, there are two potential<br/>\nproblems/solutions:<br/>\n- the first is more of a solution than a problem, and has to do with the<br/>\nexcluded.properties file.  Check that an entry for the XmlEncoder<br/>\npackage is in/out, and try adding/removing the entry.  It may create<br/>\nmore problems than it solves, but its worth a try.<br/>\n<br/>\n- the second is more a problem than a solution: check that you do not<br/>\ninclude 2 versions of the XML libraries in the classpath.  This<br/>\nsometimes causes the Swing GUI to get its knickers in a twist.<br/>\n<br/>\nTry these out, and report back if successful.<br/>\n<br/>\nManuel Amago.<br/>\nmailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mamago@...\">mamago@...</a></div>",
