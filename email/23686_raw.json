Ok so I wrote a simple test that shows a JFrame and uses Java =\r\nRobot to click on it. Works fine run in Eclipse on Mac as an application or=\r\n JUnit test but fails when run as JUnit plugin test. Frame would show 1 out=\r\n of 5 or so times. Removing all unneeded plugins resulted in frame always b=\r\neing shown but the click never seems to happen.\n&gt; \n&gt; I also tried Window Li=\r\ncker and the included Calculator test(s) - same thing... runs as a JUnit Te=\r\nst but fails as a JUnit Plugin Test. One time the frame was shown, but noth=\r\ning happened (so the test failed). The other times, the frame didn&#39;t even s=\r\nhow. Tried removing all VM args and unnecessary plugins.\n&gt; \n&gt; Is this relat=\r\ned to the args that Eclipse uses to run plugin tests on Mac? Or the core pl=\r\nugins included to run the tests? Or...?\n&gt; \n&gt; Shaun.\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In junit@yahoo=\r\ngroups.com, Dale Emery &lt;dale@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Hi whoever you are,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; Hi - thanks for your reply. I&#39;m actually using Alex Ruiz&#39;s FEST for ou=\r\nr testing and it works quite well on Windows. With or without FEST on the M=\r\nac, I can&#39;t seem to get any UI tests to run. The initial frame/window comes=\r\n up in some cases but I can&#39;t do much more than that. When running JUnit te=\r\nsts (again with or without FEST), I don&#39;t even see the frame.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nI&#39;ve gone through what docs there are for FEST and have read the blog/artic=\r\nle but I can&#39;t figure it out.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I&#39;ve used FEST to test Swing co=\r\nde on a toy project:\n&gt; &gt; https://github.com/dhemery/towers.dead\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; La=\r\nter I restarted the project and used WindowLicker instead:\n&gt; &gt; https://gith=\r\nub.com/dhemery/Towers\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; It&#39;s been a while since I visited either pro=\r\nject, but I think the (few) UI tests run. Neither version of the code does =\r\nmuch, so there aren&#39;t many UI tests. The older one (which uses FEST) has mo=\r\nre features and tests.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I wrote all of this code on Macs running Sn=\r\now Leopard and Eclipse Ganymede. I haven&#39;t tried it on Lion or Helios.\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; Dale\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --\n&gt; &gt; Dale Emery\n&gt; &gt; Consultant to software teams and l=\r\neaders\n&gt; &gt; http://dhemery.com\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; [Non-text portions of=\r\n this message have been removed]\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this me=\r\nssage have been removed]\n\n\n",
