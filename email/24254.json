Include Johannes&#39; ClasspathSuite pretty much as-is.<br/>\n&gt; 2. Include Dale&#39;s RuntimeSuite pretty much as-is.<br/>\n&gt; 3. Include both runners but delegate to a common implementation <br/>\n&gt; behind the scenes.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Personally, I very much like Dale&#39;s approach. It is very flexible, <br/>\n&gt; one can easily add a custom Finder or Filter without touching the <br/>\n&gt; runner. Option (3) would have the advantage that existing users of <br/>\n&gt; ClasspathSuite would have an easy migration (changing package <br/>\n&gt; names).<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I haven&#39;t looked at RuntimeSuite yet, but if it is more flexible it should be the way to go. Migrating existing cpsuite suites shouldn&#39;t be much of an issue either since - I assume - a typical user has only a handful - or less - hand-configured classes to convert.<br/>\n<br/>\nJohannes</div>",
