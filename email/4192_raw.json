It it\nbased on top of JUnit and it will help you for unit testing Servlets,\nEJBs, Taglibs, Filters (MDBs not yet but coming soon ;-)). It won&#39;t help\nyou more than pure JUnit for XML processing though.\n\nYou may also want to have a look at Mock Objects (see\nhttp://www.mockobjects.com).\n\nGood luck,\n-Vincent\n\n&gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; From: mschnayd [mailto:mschnayd@...]\n&gt; Sent: 22 February 2002 20:36\n&gt; To: junit@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Subject: [junit] Please Help, Need Guidance\n&gt; \n&gt; Hello Guys,\n&gt; \n&gt; I am an architect for a small software company.  We have been\n&gt; developing our product for about two years now, and have been trying\n&gt; to be pretty good about the developmental practices.  We have coding\n&gt; standards, good architecture and frameworks in place, and allot of\n&gt; tallented developers. What we don&#39;t have is a solid suite of unit\n&gt; tests.\n&gt; \n&gt; What happened is at the beginning of the project management was\n&gt; onboard with the schedule that we demanded that included time for\n&gt; building the unit tests.  For about 6 month now that is no longer a\n&gt; case.  We have not written unit tests for the past 6 month.  The\n&gt; tests that have been written are long out of sync. with the codebase,\n&gt; to the point where everyone has them excluded from compilation.\n&gt; \n&gt; I really would like us to get back on track and developer a better\n&gt; quality product; alos, god knows our QA need some help.\n&gt; \n&gt; Anyway, to keep a long story short, what I am looking for is for best\n&gt; practices and guidlines on developintg unit tests for various types\n&gt; of classes (Regular classes, Servlets, EJBs, MDBs, XML processing).\n&gt; Is there a framework that somebody has developed on top of the JUnit.\n&gt; If not, I would be glad to build one, assuming it will not require\n&gt; too much time.  Being a great fan of reuse, I would rather use an\n&gt; already created testing framework.  JUnit is great, but it is very\n&gt; simple and does not have guidance on testing Data Access code, ...\n&gt; \n&gt; If any of you can give me a list of books, articles, code samples,\n&gt; references to other web-sites; I will greatly appreciate it.\n&gt; I am realy glad that people like Erich Gamma and Kent Beck are out\n&gt; there to help the rest of us get our acts together; however, there is\n&gt; still some much more that could be done to make life easier for\n&gt; fast-pased development teams like the one I am working for.\n&gt; \n&gt; Regards, Mikhail Shnayderman.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ------------------------ Yahoo!
