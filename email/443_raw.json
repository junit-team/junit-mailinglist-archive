I created aPerson & anAdress class. Both are fine with respect to behavior \n(files are accessible here http://lautre.org/tsmets/java/tmp/Load.zip, because I recompiled the Loadtester to fit under the junit.load package). \n\nThere&#39;s however a weird thing when it come to running the test under heavy time constraints - I mean close to the minimum time. \n\nGC occurs permanently & though after about 85 runs the program does one much longer run before going on at the previous speed.\n\nTx for any hints on what really occured.\n\nThomas,\n\n\n",
