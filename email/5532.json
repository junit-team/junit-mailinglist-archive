It keeps me from putting too much code in the UI and ease the<br/>\ntesting (the tests are simply considered as yet another client).<br/>\n<br/>\nI would write a DBAccess class that deals with generating the SQL code (use<br/>\nPrepareStatement instead of Statement: it&#39;s nicer and less error prone) and has<br/>\nsome public methods.  You can now easily test your SQL code and your Swing<br/>\ninterface will hopefully become really easy (and you could skip your testing if<br/>\nyou&#39;re confident).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe advantage of this approach is that you can now have different drivers for<br/>\ndifferent dbs (like an XML db).  And on top of that you can reuse the same<br/>\ntests to validate all your drivers!  Isn&#39;t that a nice solution?<br/>\n<br/>\nTip : Constructors can call other constructors:<br/>\npublic AddState(java.awt.Dialog parent, boolean modal, int id_State) {<br/>\n   this(parent, modal);<br/>\n   id = id_State;<br/>\n}<br/>\nor (I prefer this version)<br/>\npublic AddState(java.awt.Dialog parent, boolean modal) {<br/>\n   this(parent, modal, NO_STATE);<br/>\n}<br/>\n<br/>\nhth<br/>\n<br/>\n-Vladimir<br/>\n\r<br/>\n--<br/>\nVladimir Bossicard<br/>\nwww.bossicard.com</div>",
