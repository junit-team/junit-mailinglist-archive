    "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1469528686\">I find that option #1 is superior. As you say, it reduces exposure to<br/>\ninternals. It also gives one the option of invoking that code in the<br/>\nfield. Especially where there are user accessable APIs, I find it handy to<br/>\nask a user to invoke invariants checking around problem code while<br/>\ndiagnosing a possible API bug. If your assertInvariants(..) method is<br/>\nrecursive, it is also not difficult to add a menu option that will invoke<br/>\na full internal state check at run-time.<br/>\n<br/>\nI always have the invariants checks run in my unit tests. This gives you<br/>\nthe ability to catch a lot more bugs and get better diagnostics resorting<br/>\nto soak testing. A lot of times, your unit test may pass but leave the<br/>\nclass-under-test in a bad state. In a real program, the next statement<br/>\nwould fail, but its never caught in your test because the fixture is<br/>\nrecycled. Invoking the invariants tests after state changes in tests is<br/>\ncheap and saves headaches in the long run.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Fri, 14 Dec 2001, Robertson, Don wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Let&#39;s assume that invoking an assertInvariants() method within your class&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; methods is too expensive to be practical, but you want it for the purpose of<br/>\n&gt; unit testing anyway. Would it be structurally superior to :<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 1) Implement such a method within the actual class and invoke it from the<br/>\n&gt; test case. The main benefits I see are minimal exposure of the class&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; internals (although it *is* white box testing after all), and visual<br/>\n&gt; proximity of the invariant conditions for implementors/modifiers. The<br/>\n&gt; negative is that there is &quot;dead code&quot; (from a runtime perspective) within<br/>\n&gt; the class.<br/>\n&gt; 2) Allow access to internal state within the class and write the<br/>\n&gt; assertInvariants() method within the test class(es). The benefits are visual<br/>\n&gt; proximity of the invariant conditions with the other functional description<br/>\n&gt; of the class, and no dead code in the runtime class. The negative is the<br/>\n&gt; need for exposure of more internal state.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Opinions?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; A second &quot;meta&quot; question might be whether you think it is worthwhile to<br/>\n&gt; check invariant conditions within your unit tests as a default behavior, or<br/>\n&gt; is it overkill?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Don<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nEric Vought<br/>\nChief Technical Officer - QLUE Consulting, Inc.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:evought@...\">evought@...</a> toll-free: 888-771-3538  RTP area: 919-816-9901 </span></blockquote></div>",
