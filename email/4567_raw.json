I don&#39;t see how JUnit is responsible for this smell,\n&gt;&gt;or a JUnit-based solution \n&gt;&gt;(like, say, hacking it to use reflection in order to break access \n&gt;&gt;control) that doesn&#39;t bring along serious code smells of its own.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; This problem is definitely not a JUnit problem.  It is just that it\n&gt; would be nice if JUnit could handle this problem (Works Out of The\n&gt; Box[1]).\n\n\nIt would be nice. I just don&#39;t see any way to do it without making JUnit \ntremendously stinky and ugly and dangerous. :(\n\nOf course, if you take my position that wanting to test private methods \nfrom a separate package altogether is a bad smell, then it does Work Out \nof the Box. :}  It&#39;s doing *exactly* what i would want it to do - making \nme think about Why as well as How, and preventing shortcuts.\n\n\n&gt; Another tension is that of consistency: if you code ALL your test\n&gt; classes as Inner classes, you may well use them to test private access\n&gt; methods also.  If you don&#39;t, however, you add an extra smell and\n&gt; inconsistent use of Inner/Test classes.  This could become a maintenance\n&gt; problem.\n\n\nI agree, whatever mechanism you use for associating test classes with \nthe classes tested, it should be applied consistently. Personally, i \nwrite my test classes as same package, same directory. I don&#39;t find it \nclutters because i can exclude the test classes from jars via Ant, and i \nwind up with both the test class and the tested class in open editor \nsessions all the time anyway. (i would actually argue that the coupling \nbetween class heirarchy and source code file names in Java is a smell in \nitself, albiet a minor one. Certainly, this wouldn&#39;t be so much of an \nissue if we could just stick an inner class in a separate directory).\n\nTaken this way, whether or not to unit test private methods becomes a \nconscious decision that should be made at the beginning of development. \nIf you&#39;re going to test private methods from the start, then you should \ndo all your test classes as inner classes (and accept the smell of large \nclass files). If not, then you should treat the need to test a private \nmethod as a smell to be treated. I don&#39;t feel either is a terrible \nsolution, although changing your mind in the middle of a project is painful.\n\n-- \n\nDavid Stagner\n\nNational Marrow Donor Program\n3001 Broadway Street NE\nBroadway Ridge Suite 500\nMinneapolis, MN  55413\n\nEmail: dstagner@...\n\n\n\n",
