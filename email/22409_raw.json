Especially users of multi-module maven builds will\nfind the threading models in junit 4.7 ParallelComputer to be quite\nslow.\n\nThere is a fairly decent unit test within\n&lt;http://%28http://github.com/krosenvold/configurable-parallel-computer/b&#92;\nlob/master/src/test/java/org/jdogma/junit/JUnitCorePerformanceTest.java#&#92;\nL83&gt;   ConfigurableParallelComputer that verifies the threading\nbehaviour of JunitCore combined with ConfigurableParallelComputer . I am\nnot sure if the same kind of test exists for ParallelComputer within\nJunit, but his test case could easily be extended to cover that as well.\n\nRemember that both surefire and ConfigurableParallelComputer contain\ndemultiplexing run listeners that make output appear in &quot;correct order&quot;\n(the one in ConfigurableParallelComputer being somewhat better than the\none in Surefire ATM)\n\nI always found in my own testing that the problem with &quot;methods&quot; is that\nthe run-time of the individual test methods is fairly small part of the\nentire test run-time (classloading and setup taking most of the time),\nand I have never been able to get much of a speed improvement out of\n&quot;methods&quot;. &quot;classes&quot; is also usually a lot safer & easier to get\nrunning. I  am reasonably sure that &quot;methods&quot; works in the\nsurefire-2.5+junit4.8.1+ConfigurableParallelComputer combination, but\nI&#39;ll definitiely accept surprises. Any specific issues should be filed\neither with ConfigurableParallelComputer at github or the apache\nsurefire issue tracker.\n\n\n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n",
