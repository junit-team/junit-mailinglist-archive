I personally use a kluge where my test class reads a system <br/>\nproperty and if true it writes to the file, and if false it uses the <br/>\ncontents of the file as a base for comparison.  Then I run:<br/>\n<br/>\n  java -Dmyprop=true org.junit.runner.JUnitCore classname<br/>\n<br/>\nDuring normal runs the property is not set so the test class asserts <br/>\nthat the output of the processing is the same as what&#39;s in the file.</div>",
