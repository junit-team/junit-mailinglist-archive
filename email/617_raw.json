I was hoping for a little variety and\nperhaps some unique and unanticipated usages of the JUnit framework.\nInterestingly, I set up Test Mentor&#39;s code coverage piece to instrument\njunit.* and ran the samples that come with JUnit through Test Mentor and saw\nthat the junit.framework package is reasonably well tested (as far as\nmethods entered) by the examples that come with it. I threw together a\nscreen capture to illustrate at:\nhttp://www.silvermark.com/evaluators/5.3result_junit.html\n\n\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\nMike Silverstein, Lead Architect\tvoice:  (919) 858-8300 x29\nSilverMark, Inc.\t\t\tfax:    (919) 858-8308\n5511 Capital Center Drive\t\tmobile: (919) 669-5906\nSuite 510, Raleigh, NC 27606\t\ttoll free: (888) 588-0668\nhttp://www.silvermark.com\t\tmsilverstein@...\n\n&gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; From: Erik Meade [mailto:emeade@...]\n&gt; Sent: Wednesday, March 07, 2001 12:50 AM\n&gt; To: junit@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Subject: RE: [junit] Need example JUnit tests to validate Test Mentor&#39;s\n&gt; support of JUnit\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Why not use the tests for JUnit itself as a start?\n&gt;\n&gt; --\n&gt; Erik Meade             emeade@...\n&gt; Senior Consultant      Object Mentor, Inc.\n&gt; http://www.junit.org\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; &gt; From: Michael Silverstein [mailto:msilverstein@...]\n&gt; &gt; Sent: Tuesday, March 06, 2001 1:01 PM\n&gt; &gt; To: junit@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; &gt; Subject: [junit] Need example JUnit tests to validate Test Mentor&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; support of JUnit\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; SilverMark (www.silvermark.com) is currently preparing for\n&gt; release of its\n&gt; &gt; extensions to Test Mentor � Java Edition to collaborate more\n&gt; closely with\n&gt; &gt; JUnit.  We are looking for existing tests that are written for the JUnit\n&gt; &gt; framework that we can incorporate into our own internal\n&gt; &gt; regression tests, to\n&gt; &gt; ensure that Test Mentor runs them correctly when executing JUnit tests.\n&gt; &gt; We&#39;ve already tested with the samples that came with JUnit and a\n&gt; &gt; few others\n&gt; &gt; and are looking for more.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Would anyone be willing to share some JUnit based tests (and the classes\n&gt; &gt; that they test), or point to some public domain tests, so we can\n&gt; &gt; ensure Test\n&gt; &gt; Mentor works correctly with JUnit under all circumstances?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; As an aside, if anyone is interested in trying out Test Mentor � Java\n&gt; &gt; Edition with their own existing JUnit-based tests, they can sign\n&gt; &gt; up for the\n&gt; &gt; prerelease at:\n&gt; &gt; http://www.silvermark.com/evaluators/5.3junit_releaseinfo.html.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Test Mentor - Java edition is a commercial Java component testing tool.\n&gt; &gt; Skimming recent appends to this group, I noticed that Test\n&gt; Mentor supports\n&gt; &gt; the following topics that were recently mentioned:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  - Transparently testing private methods\n&gt; &gt;  - Saving detailed test execution results to a file (XML).\n&gt; &gt;  - Driving tests from data files\n&gt; &gt;  - Parameterized tests\n&gt; &gt;  - User interface for selecting and running individual tests\n&gt; &gt; within a suite\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Other immediate benefits of running your JUnit tests under Test Mentor\n&gt; &gt; include:\n&gt; &gt;  - Automatic method coverage metrics\n&gt; &gt;  - Detailed assertion results reporting and fine-grained timing metrics\n&gt; &gt;  - Automatic object interaction diagramming (to see which objects are\n&gt; &gt; interacting as a result of a test)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n&gt; &gt; Mike Silverstein, Lead Architect\tvoice:  (919) 858-8300 x29\n&gt; &gt; SilverMark, Inc.\t\t\tfax:    (919) 858-8308\n&gt; &gt; 5511 Capital Center Drive\t\tmobile: (919) 669-5906\n&gt; &gt; Suite 510, Raleigh, NC 27606\t\ttoll free: (888) 588-0668\n&gt; &gt; http://www.silvermark.com\t\tmsilverstein@...\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
