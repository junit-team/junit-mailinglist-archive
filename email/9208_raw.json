B. Rainsberger wrote:\n\n&gt; One talented programmer does the work of five not-so-talented\n&gt; ones at 60% of the price (of the five).\n\nActually, one talented programmer often does things that no number of\nnon-talented programmers can do. For example, produce a system that is\nready to roll out into production at any time at all, given at most a\nfew hours notice. Or create a system such that a full production release\nof a huge system can be done in a couple of hours.\n\nUnfortuantely, it can be a lot easier to hire five, or even twenty,\nnot-so-talented programmers than one talented one.\n\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; In my current project, we don&#39;t even have any dedicated QA people...\n\n&gt; Hm. Do you mean that you don&#39;t have people who test full time? or you\n&gt; don&#39;t have people will formal testing experience and/or raw testing skill?\n\nWe don&#39;t have people who test full time, in the sense of someone devoted\nto writing customer and functional tests. Everybody helps out a bit with\nthe customer tests, though some more than others, and the functional\ntests are done by the programmers as they work on somethign that needs\nfunctional testing.\n\nBut another point of view would be that &quot;everyone is a full-time tester&quot;\nin that everyone is expected to make sure the code has reasonable test\ncoverage, and not just for the programmers&#39; unit tests.\n\n&gt; Google &quot;What is exploratory testing?&quot;\n\nInteresting. Does this quote really describe exploratory testing?\n\n     To the extent that the next test we do is influenced by the result\n     of the last test we did, we are doing exploratory testing.\n\n     (http://www.satisfice.com/articles/what_is_et.htm)\n\nThis seems to me that it could just as well describe test-first\nprogramming; I often decide what my next test will be based on the\nprevious tests I&#39;ve just produced. (&quot;Hmmm. We just saw and fixed a\nfailure like such-and-such, does that mean that this other thing might\nbe able to fail like that, too? Let&#39;s write a test and find out.&quot;)\n\nIt sounds to me like the &quot;scripted testing&quot; he&#39;s talking about in that\narticle is not XP-style testing, where you run the tests as you come\nup with them, but instead one where you create a whole series of tests\nbefore you take them to the code. Especially where he says:\n\n    Scripting has its place. I can imagine testing situations where\n    efficiency and repeatability are so important that we should script\n    or automate them.\n\nI can&#39;t imagine a situation where efficiency and repeatability are\n*not* important enough to script the tests! But if you can somehow\nmanipulate the system quickly enough to do exploratory testing, you can\nprobably come up with a way for the script to manipulate the system even\nmore quickly, and then just add your tests to the script, rather than\nthrowing them away as soon as you&#39;ve tried them out.\n\ncjs\n-- \nCurt Sampson  &lt;cjs@...&gt;   +81 90 7737 2974   http://www.NetBSD.org\n    Don&#39;t you know, in this new Dark Age, we&#39;re all light.  --XTC\n\n",
