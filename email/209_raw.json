Having made that decision I am now \nenhancing JUnit to provide additional functionality to make it more \nsuitable for the task at hand.  This includes:\n\n- filtering the junit methods from the stack trace output.\n- causing the stack trace to be output for all assertion failures and fails.\n- making the test cases continue after an assertion failure or fail (the \nskeleton code for this was provided by jpulley (Thanks Jerry) - see: \nhttps://sourceforge.net/forum/forum.php?thread_id=64361&forum_id=48543)\n\nThe last thing on my list of things to implement (the others are done) \nis to store the test results in a database to allow the tracking of pass \nrates over time.  I haven&#39;t given too much thought to how I might do \nthis yet but I would imagine it would be an extension to TestRunner.\nI am not sure I will get to this just yet as other priorities are on the rise.\n\nI confess to little knowledge of XP - just what you come across in \nthe JUnit documentation.\n\nScott\n\n\n",
