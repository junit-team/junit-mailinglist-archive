Below is an outline of the framework tha=\r\nt \nwe have which we are trying to migrate to JUNIT\n\nexample in a suite, a t=\r\nest case is like this\n\npublic void testLogin{\n\nmethod1();\nmethod2();\nmethod=\r\n3();\n// if assert is used here in this test case it will work fine\n}\n\n\nThe =\r\nabove methods have lot of other calls to otehr methods and I \nhave to use a=\r\nssertions in those methods also. Right now we are jsut \nhandling exceptions=\r\n in our way and throwing them so that our \nframework captures. Out framewor=\r\nk with respect to test suites/cases \nis almost similar to JUNIT. If i can g=\r\net a way how the assertions \ncan be used in these other method calls which =\r\nare being made from \nthe testXXX() methods i will be successful in migratin=\r\ng to JUNIT.\n\nPlease suggest if there is any alternative/solution. Thanks in=\r\n \nadvance.\n--- In junit@yahoogroups.com, Chris Dollin &lt;chris.dollin@...&gt; wr=\r\note:\n&gt;\n&gt; On Friday 22 June 2007 02:35, sireesha wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; how can we us=\r\ne assertions outside a junit testcase and still \nmake the \n&gt; &gt; test case ha=\r\nndle it.\n&gt; \n&gt; I don&#39;t understand what you&#39;re trying to do.\n&gt; \n&gt; A [junit] a=\r\nssertion, when it fails, throws a suitable exception. \nThe\n&gt; test case fram=\r\nework catches the exception and records it.
