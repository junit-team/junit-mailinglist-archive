I&#39;ll confirm. Probably better than the @Before given=\r\n that I need inheritance anyway.\n\nIn the mean time, I had put an assumeThat=\r\n on the @Before method, and that worked fine (subclasses call super and red=\r\neclare the annotation, so all is well). However, for the @After method, the=\r\n assumeThat method just makes the test fail. I guess it was somewhat surpri=\r\nsing that the teardown is run even if the setup fails an assumeThat assumpt=\r\nion, but I can certainly understand that. But why not tollerate an assumeTh=\r\nat in teardown? I agree it is somewhat strange that you already ran the tes=\r\nt and still want to assume it away, but I would still think that assume sho=\r\nuld stop a test at all three levels (@Before, the test and @After). What do=\r\n you think?\n\n--- In junit@yahoogroups.com, David Saff &lt;david@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; That&#39;s right: Rules can affect the processing after @Before and before\n&gt; =\r\n@After.  Could you replace your setup/teardown with an\n&gt; ExternalResource r=\r\nule?\n&gt; \n&gt;    David Saff\n&gt; \n&gt; On Thu, Aug 20, 2009 at 11:11 AM, yme098765432=\r\n1&lt;yme0987654321@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; OK, I figured out the problem. What happens=\r\n is that I have a custom runner that suppresses the test (these are slow te=\r\nsts, so they are only run at check-in, not by the developer while developin=\r\ng).\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; However, when I replace that with a Rule, the setup method is s=\r\ntill run (looks slow). So I guess the conclusion is that @Rule can&#39;t interr=\r\nupt or override the setup and teardown process, so if you need to do that y=\r\nou are back to a Runner? (Or making your own setups rule-aware I guess).\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; --- In junit@yahoogroups.com, David Saff &lt;david@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Yi=\r\nshai,\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; I just ran a test, and the Rules in the superclass were pic=\r\nked up.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Can you post a small example? =A0Thanks,\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; =A0 =A0Davi=\r\nd Saff\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; On Thu, Aug 20, 2009 at 10:21 AM, David Saff&lt;david@&gt; wrote=\r\n:\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Yishai,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Sounds like a bug. =A0Can you file it at git=\r\nhub? =A0Sorry for the oversight,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; =A0 David Saff\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n On Wed, Aug 19, 2009 at 8:26 PM, yme0987654321&lt;yme0987654321@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt;&gt; I&#39;m looking at the new Rule annotation in JUnit4.
