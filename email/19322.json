Do you mean write?<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy is the volume of test code a challenge? I&#39;d agree it is one if the <br/>\ncompiler chokes on it, but I don&#39;t see the connection of size of test <br/>\ncode vs size of production code you seem to imply.<br/>\n<br/>\nSame for effort -- why do you relate the effort on test code to the effort <br/>\non production code? Effort on test code pays back in less defects and <br/>\nclearer design and other things. Would you also complain about spending <br/>\nmore effort on e.g. design or documentation that on production code?<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat is the complexity in launching unit tests? If that is in fact <br/>\ncomplex, wouldn&#39;t that indicate a flawed build process?<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat are patterned objects?<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat are unique test maintenance points?<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy is it a good thing if the &quot;need for a shared understanding of <br/>\npatterned object implementation definitions&quot; (whatever that is) is <br/>\nincreased?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSure one can reflectively gather all setters and getters and call them.<br/>\nHowever, what is really gained from that?<br/>\n<br/>\nAs you write, you may reach higher coverage. Sure, you may even find a <br/>\ndefect. However, I&#39;d be afraid this would lead to a false sense of <br/>\nsecurity. It&#39;s like testing that you can roll the windows in your car up <br/>\nand down and ignoring the engine.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, I cannot imagine how this should work for anything serious.<br/>\nMy tests often involve multiple objects, for example, I may want to set a <br/>\nCalender object in another object: someObject.setCalender(aCalender).<br/>\nHow do you create meaningful instances of the calender in this case?<br/>\nHow do you automatically create more complex objects where the <br/>\nconstructor may require yet other objects?<br/>\nWhat about setters that are not meant to be set easily, e.g., a file name <br/>\nmay only be set before the file is opened?<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, only few of my objects usually have setters and getters, so I&#39;d not <br/>\neven bother downloading TestUtil. The getters and setters are certainly <br/>\ncovered in other tests anyway.<br/>\n<br/>\nLast but not least I don&#39;t see why you call this a pattern. It does not <br/>\nseem to share a lot with patterns as described by Gamma et al -- your AMT <br/>\ndoes not even involve code, besides naming conventions?<br/>\n<br/>\nSorry, I don&#39;t see how this &quot;pattern&quot; is useful at all.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers,<br/>\n<br/>\nRobert</div>",
