The logic in that metho=\r\nd\nbasically tries to transform this object into an array of Objects, So\nsta=\r\nrting from the next step we need that object for proceeding with\nour logic.=\r\n \n\nI too agree that it might bcome an overhead for mocking the getter\nmetho=\r\nds, is there any pattern here I can use to fix this ?\n\nThanks and Regards, =\r\n\nSarat kumar. \n\n--- In junit@yahoogroups.com, Michael Feathers &lt;mfeathers@.=\r\n..&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Kumar,\n&gt; \n&gt; Mocking those getter methods might be overkil=\r\nl.   Does the result of \n&gt; your big method vary at all or is it dependent  =\r\nsolely on the state of \n&gt; the variables after initialization?\n&gt; \n&gt; Michael =\r\nFeathers\n&gt; \n&gt; edu_kumar wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;Hi all, \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;I&#39;ve been stuck with a=\r\n problem, when i&#39;m unit testing my code. \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;My problem is that i&#39;ve a =\r\nreally huge method,which calls several small\n&gt; &gt;methods ( methods so small,=\r\n they&#39;re just getters for member\n&gt; &gt;variables), If i have to unit test this=\r\n method, i&#39;ve to make sure all\n&gt; &gt;the small methods that it subsequently in=\r\nvoke, work as they&#39;re\n&gt; &gt;expected. But all my member variables get initiali=\r\nzed seperately in a\n&gt; &gt;different method which is of no relation with the BI=\r\nG method I wanted\n&gt; &gt;to test in the first place. \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Can I test my meth=\r\nod without worrying about the initialization of my\n&gt; &gt;object&#39;s data, by moc=\r\nking the results of all my getter methods ?  \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Ex: \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Class MyCl=\r\nass\n&gt; &gt;{\n&gt; &gt;   private Object _member; \n&gt; &gt;   public void initialize()\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n  {\n&gt; &gt;     //huge initialization process, which initializes my member\n&gt; &gt;v=\r\nariables. \n&gt; &gt;      _member =3D new Object(); \n&gt; &gt;   }\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;   public voi=\r\nd myHugeMethod()\n&gt; &gt;   {\n&gt; &gt;       //.. my logic here.\n&gt; &gt;       Object m =\r\n=3D getMember(); \n&gt; &gt;       //... proceed with this value. \n&gt; &gt;   }\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n   public Object getMember()\n&gt; &gt;   {\n&gt; &gt;      return this._member; \n&gt; &gt;   }=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;}\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Now, if I call &#39;myHugeMethod()&#39; without calling &#39;initialize()&#39;=\r\n method,\n&gt; &gt;it always return NULL. \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;All i wanted to do is to test &#39;m=\r\nyHugeMethod()&#39;, by mocking\n&gt; &gt;&#39;getMember()&#39; method and setting the result w=\r\nhat i wanted. \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;I tried using Jmock for creating mocks in my test cas=\r\ne, but it fails\n&gt; &gt;because the mock object only knows what exactly I wanted=\r\n to mock but\n&gt; &gt;nothing more than that. All my application logic is present=\r\n in\n&gt; &gt;&#39;MyClass&#39; object not in its mock. \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;How can I achieve this usi=\r\nng Jmock ? \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;FYI, I tried with a direct approach by extending &#39;MyClas=\r\ns&#39; and\n&gt; &gt;overriding the &#39;getMember()&#39; method in it. But I still feel there=\r\n&#39;s a\n&gt; &gt;better way to do it. \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;I&#39;ll be very thankful for any help in =\r\nthis regard.. \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Thanks in advance, \n&gt; &gt;Sarat kumar. \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; =\r\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n",
