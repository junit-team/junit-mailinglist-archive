So, I now have two things <br/>\nI don&#39;t know, leading to two possibilities:<br/>\n<br/>\n1) Delete (or comment out) the first test, and write a test for the <br/>\nprivate method, so I can figure out what&#39;s going on there first.<br/>\n<br/>\n2) Introduce a seam to protect me for now from the private method.  <br/>\nFigure out how to run the higher-level method without running the <br/>\nprivate method, so that I can handle the higher-level method first.<br/>\n<br/>\nI used to believe in a third alternative: hack away with print <br/>\nstatements and a debugger until I get my head around both of these <br/>\nthings I don&#39;t know, and possibly more than seven others.  I no longer <br/>\nbelieve that&#39;s a good use of my time.<br/>\n<br/>\n    David Saff</div>",
