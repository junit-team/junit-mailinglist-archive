In those cases my *first* look would be at wether the design can<br/>\nbenefit from moving the method. I didn&#39;t even say that I&#39;d always do it,<br/>\njust that I can&#39;t remember an instance where there design didn&#39;t improve<br/>\nwhen I did.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope this explains my view a little bit better...<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers, Ilja</div>",
