Martin\n           Prentice Hall, 2002 \n\nhttp://www.objectmentor.com/resources/bookstore/books/AgileSoftwareDev\nelopmentPPP\n\nThis book is for the software developer in the trenches. It describes \nAgile Software Development from a practitioner&#39;s point of view. \nThrough dozens of case studies it describes and teaches the \nprinciples of object oriented software design, the patterns that \nembody those principles, and the practices that enable individuals \nand teams to use those principles. \n\nThis is a book of Java and C++ code -- lots of code. Every point the \nbook makes about software development it amplifies with examples in \ncode backed up with UML diagrams. What&#39;s more, the code and UML are \nnot presented in completed form -- leaving the reader to wonder how \nthey got there -- rather the code and UML are presented in stages, \nfrom humble beginnings to completed projects. By reading it, and the \naccompanying text, you will see the process of software design. \n\nIf you want to learn UML, if you want to learn how to design \nsoftware, if you want to learn design patterns, or if you want to \nlearn the best practices of software development, this is the book to \nread. \n\nThe link above will take you to the table of contents, sample \nchapters, and other promotional material.\n\n\n",
