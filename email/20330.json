An end-to-end test is a test that tests the system from outside.<br/>\n &quot;Edge-to-edge&quot; might be a better term because most systems don&#39;t have<br/>\n&quot;front&quot; and &quot;back&quot; ends.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;End-to-end&quot; also applies to the development process.  I like my<br/>\nend-to-end test run to build the system from source into deployable<br/>\npackages and automatically deploy those into a production-like<br/>\nenvironment in the same way as a real production release.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  2) I was thinking TDD is only used to develop functionality by writing<br/>\n&gt;  unit tests first and then the code, can it be more generic to apply<br/>\n&gt;  for functional testing ?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>In TDD you drive all development with tests.  So, if you want the<br/>\nsystem to have a feature you first write a test that demonstrates that<br/>\nthe system doesn&#39;t have that feature.  You then work out which classes<br/>\nneed to be be added/modified and do those changes by repeatedly<br/>\nwriting unit-tests, implementing the code, refactoring, and deciding<br/>\nthe next change to make, until eventually the end-to-end test passes.<br/>\nYou then write another end-to-end test.<br/>\n<br/>\nEnd-to-end tests give you most feedback about the system&#39;s external<br/>\nquality.  Unit tests give you most feedback about the system&#39;s<br/>\ninternal quality.  They also allow you to maximise branch coverage by<br/>\nrunning fast (so you can exercise the code with many different input<br/>\nvalues) and letting you inject faults (by making mock objects throw<br/>\nexceptions that are hard to cause in a real system).<br/>\n<br/>\nIn my experience you need both.  System tests tell you when the system<br/>\nhas stopped working.  Unit tests narrow down precisely where the fault<br/>\nhas been introduced.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs the system gets larger, you may use subsystem tests that cover<br/>\ncoarse-grained components like servers, MDBs, etc. However, I have<br/>\nfound those only necessary in systems that were not originally written<br/>\nwith TDD.  In systems that were written from the start with TDD,<br/>\ncomponents are usually loosely coupled enough to let you run<br/>\nsubsystems in a unit-test fixture.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  3) I need to understand more on this &#39;end-to-end&#39; testing, are there<br/>\n&gt;  any tools available ? or I should rely on the build process for<br/>\n&gt;  executing all the test cases for me?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  Actually, I&#39;ve been started using unit-testing tools like Junit<br/>\n&gt;  recently for the newly added API in our product but rest of the code<br/>\n&gt;  is pretty much legacy in nature. So, i was wondering are there any<br/>\n&gt;  tools for doing this end-to-end testing ? just like Junit ?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I use JUnit and a lot of helper code and support libraries to run<br/>\nend-to-end tests and have the automated build run all the tests, unit<br/>\ntests and end-to-end tests.  There are many tools for testing<br/>\napplications end to end, like GUI automation tools, but I&#39;ve not found<br/>\nthem to fit into a TDD process very well.<br/>\n<br/>\n--Nat</div>",
