It makes sense that a lot of us\nwould take an interest in the direction of junit development since we&#39;re all\ndevelopers (and pretty good ones based on the high quality of the posts I\nsee here). But certainly there are plenty of readers who are not as\ninterested. Because of this, it is generally considered bad form to cross\npost. I would suggest that those of us that are interested in development\nshould join the junit-devel list so this list can be the user list. Then\npeople can opt-in to the conversations that are interesting to them.\nAnyways, I&#39;ll leave it to the moderators to define the scope of these lists.\n\nChris\n\nP.S. On the topic at hand, I know that Vladimir Bossicard has implemented a\nscheme that will let you register services with the junit architecture for\nletting you extend it easily for custom reporting and what-not. I don&#39;t know\nthe current status of that effort though so perhaps he can comment?\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: David Stagner [mailto:dstagner@...]\nSent: Tuesday, November 27, 2001 11:11 AM\nTo: junit@yahoogroups.com\nSubject: Re: [junit] Making JUnit more pluggable for add-ons\n\n\nScott Stirling wrote:\n\n&gt; I&#39;m glad he did.  But I guess this is the user list?  I thought it was the\n&gt; only JUnit list. Doh!\n\n\nI&#39;ll second that i&#39;m glad he cross-posted it.  I don&#39;t read the dev \nlist, and probably wouldn&#39;t (i don&#39;t have enough time to read the lists \nthat are higher priority as is).  I may not be actively involved in \ndevelopment, but i&#39;m very pleased to see such a carefully thought out \nand well-written proposal on the regular list!  I think it&#39;s great to \ntoss ideas for future development onto the general list, so long as they \nare nice and clear.  It&#39;s a good way to get feedback.\n\n-- \n\nDavid Stagner\n\nNational Marrow Donor Program\n3001 Broadway Street NE\nBroadway Ridge Suite 500\nMinneapolis, MN  55413\n\nEmail: dstagner@...\n\n\n\n\nTo unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\njunit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n \n\nYour use of Yahoo!
