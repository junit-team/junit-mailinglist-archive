That was the model that built some big software\n&gt; tool companies (Rational, etc.), but it isn&#39;t working well any more. I don&#39;t\n&gt; have the answer--it depends on what people and companies are willing to pay\n&gt; for--but there needs to be some way to return a profit from investment in\n&gt; software tools. Per-class licensing is intended to make quick, small-scale\n&gt; use of tools inexpensive, but it doesn&#39;t seem to scale well. Over the long\n&gt; run I think service models based on proprietary software (a la\n&gt; Salesforce.com) will become more common, but it&#39;s hard to see how to apply\n&gt; that to software tools at the moment.\n\nI think I understand the antiquated licence scheme it&#39;s meant to \nreplace, but I would rather pay a tiered subscription fee based on a \nmeasure of how much I use the software (say, the number of outcomes it \ndetects?), rather than what the resulting design looks like.\n\n&gt; Anyway, objection noted. Thanks.\n\nYou&#39;re welcome, and thank you for noting it. I know it&#39;s a knotty \nproblem to solve. I can&#39;t claim to know better, but I know what I don&#39;t \nlike, and I don&#39;t like this (quite). Of course, I&#39;m not exactly in \nAgitar&#39;s market for this product right now, so my opinion is largely \ntheoretical in nature at present.\n\nTake care.\n-- \nJ. B.
