Hence no war file etc.\n\n    This can be down easily with ServerTestCase framwork extension, \neven the original ServerTestCase extension post did not indicate this \ncan be down. \n\n    Testing regular java class with Junit is easy; Testing EJB \nsession can be down easily as well. But testing EJB entity bean with \nlocal interface is not as easy, simply because there is no remote \ninterface to be invoked. \n\n    There are several approaches to test EJB local interfaces: \n\n   1. Write an session bean as EJB entity bean&#39;s proxy and test \nagainst the session bean proxy. This approach is not good, as every \nchange in entity bean interfaces, one has to change session bean as \nwell as test cases. \n\n   2. Another one is to dyanmically invoked the test cases inside the \nserver. \n\n   The ServerTestCase extension using an EJB session bean to allow \ntest cases be involked inside the application container, through the \nthis particular session Bean. This fit perfectly for the second \napproach. \n\n    I tried it out and it works for me. \n\n   The only things need to watch out are: \n\n   1. Test case needs extends ServerTestCase not TestCase\n   2. Test case are intended to be called inside server, so \n       Context ctx = new InitialContext() should have no arguments\n   3. TestCase needs to be deployed to application server\n   4. According EJB 2.0 spec (correct me if i miss understand it)\n         The session bean should declare ejb-ref or ejb-local-ref\n      for all the EJB entity beans used. \n\n       This is going to be a drag if we constant need to change \ndeployment descriptor for the ServerTestCase&#39;s session bean when we \nadd new entity beans.  But the good news is some application server\nsuch as Weblogic 6.1 SP2 does not seem to reply on this to find the \nejb beans. So One can uses one type of application server to test and \ndevelop. \n\n       I am using weblogic 6.1, and I did not declare ejb-ref or ejb-\nlocal-ref. It works fine for me. \n\n\n    Hope this helpful for someone out there. \n\n\nChester\n\n\n   \n\n\n\n",
