I&#39;d advice against=\r\n &quot;navigating&quot;\n&gt; with mocks (in order to test this branch mockA.someFlag() n=\r\needs to\n&gt; return 4711 and then it will go through this loop two times befor=\r\ne \nso\n&gt; mockA.hasNext() must return true twice and then false. After that w=\r\ne\n&gt; setup expectations on MockB and those are the ones we /really/ care\n&gt; a=\r\nbout).\nYes, that does sound familiar!\n\n&gt; Basically, if you are /navigating/=\r\n to something that you care about.\n&gt; See if you can structure your code so =\r\nthat you don&#39;t have to \nnavigate.\n&gt; Can you extract that chunk of logic to =\r\na separate method or class. \nDo\n&gt; you lack an abstraction?\nInteresting - an=\r\nother pointer to places where we&#39;re putting too much \nin one place. OK, tha=\r\nt&#39;s interesting - sounds as if everything&#39;s \npointing towards that as the m=\r\najor issue...\n\n\nThanks for the info, and for the link too - something else =\r\nI&#39;ll take \na peek at!\n\nThanks again,\nTracey\n\n\n\n\n",
