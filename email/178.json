But as you say, that can be<br/>\n </span></blockquote>tricky<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; when the input to your component needs to come from some other<br/>\n </span></blockquote>component.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; In these cases you may find it worthwhile to invest the time to<br/>\n </span></blockquote>create test<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; stubs for these objects.<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; Here&#39;s an elementary example:  Suppose you&#39;re testing the &quot;foo&quot;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>method of<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; your &quot;Comp&quot; component.  However, this method requires a &quot;Bar&quot; object<br/>\n </span></blockquote>to be<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; passed in, and the only way to get one of these is to interact with<br/>\n </span></blockquote>some<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; other component(s)--something of a unit-testing &quot;no-no.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;     public interface Comp {<br/>\n&gt;         public void foo(Bar bar);<br/>\n&gt;     }<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; What you want to do is create another implementation of the Bar<br/>\n </span></blockquote>interface<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; called TestBar, which returns dummy test data instead of doing<br/>\n </span></blockquote>actual work.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; (If Bar is not already an interface, renaming it something like<br/>\n </span></blockquote>BarImpl and<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; making Bar an interface!)

This is because the data depends on other data,<br/>\nand is typically meaningless without it.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo give a concrete description, we work with airline resource<br/>\noptimization. Suppose I want to test the flight connections module. I<br/>\ncan&#39;t do this without creating some connection data. Connection data<br/>\nis meaningless without flight data. Flight data is meaningless without<br/>\naircraft and airport data. Then you need aircraft type, and<br/>\nlocation descriptions, and so on.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, the nature of optimization is such that, generally, testing<br/>\nanything using 2 airports and one flight is not going to tell you<br/>\nanything meaningful about whether anything works or not. Thus creating<br/>\nmanageable amounts of dummy data is problematic in itself.<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course, I can use real data, and all the necessary components to<br/>\nload and manipulate it. But then I&#39;m barely unit-testing, am I?<br/>\nIt basically turns into functional testing in any case.<br/>\n<br/>\nDoes anyone have any insights/experience of similar problems?<br/>\n<br/>\nGeoff Bache</div>",
