Automated test cases can be re-run in a fraction of the time\nrequired to repeat the manual testing.\n\nIn addition, after a functional change, the only test cases to build\nare tests for the new functionality or maintenance against tests which\nwork against functionality that has been modified. Doing that\nmaintenance, and then running all tests, is faster and more reliable\nthan repeating all testing (new and old) manually. The effect is\ncumulative.\n\nHope this helps!\n\n-jn-\n\nOn Wed, Mar 26, 2008 at 2:36 AM, Sateesh\n&lt;sateeshkumar.soundarapandian@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi,\n&gt;  In our application, we planned to use JUnit. but our application is\n&gt;  like fetching, inserting, updating data in the databases. there is no\n&gt;  domain bussiness logics involved. that is there will be no\n&gt;  calculations etc., We feel that for our application testing could be\n&gt;  done manually. Even if we try with JUnit, the time taken for test case\n&gt;  preparation is almost equal to the time taken to implement the\n&gt;  functionality. Pls instruct me.\n&gt;\n&gt;  with regards,\n&gt;  Sateesh\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n\n\n\n-- \nProgramming is the art of writing essays in crystal clear prose and\nmaking them execute. - Per Brinch Hansen\n\n",
