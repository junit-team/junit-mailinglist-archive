Put this class \nin your test package.\n\nA.2) Create a simple delegation method in the subclass with public \naccess that calls the protected method. You can also put this method \ndirectly in the class you want to test, and just remove it before \nreleasing. This causes a lot of out commenting though :-)\n\nAnd something I sometimes do before testing smaller areas...\n\nB.1) change the method access to public for the duration of the test. \nThen change it back to private. This also gives some problems in, \nthat you cannot execute automatic tests.\n\n\nIf these suggestions won&#39;t do, I see no other way than looking into \nwhat reflection might do for you.\n\nRegards,\nJakob Jenkov\n\n\n",
