So I think that when considering a new version, we could\ncertainly =\r\nconsider strongly following the design examples of other\nframeworks, like J=\r\numi or others, but in the end, a JUnit 5 would be built\npiece by piece by s=\r\nubmissions to this community.\n\nI think also that the compatibility between =\r\nJUnit 3 and JUnit 4 was\ninstrumental in making it useful for teams, and I&#39;d=\r\n like to see a similar\nfocus on backward compatibility moving forward.\n\nOne=\r\n last thought: one of the biggest confusions about JUnit 4 was the fact\ntha=\r\nt it was both a version number referring to a new release of a software\npac=\r\nkage, _and_ the only useful name for the collection of new libraries\ninclud=\r\ned in that release.  Starting in JUnit 5, I think a different naming\nscheme=\r\n would be quite helpful.  Choosing a scheme that I&#39;m positive we\n_won&#39;t_ us=\r\ne, for example:\n\n- The runner and interfaces introduced in JUnit &lt;=3D 3 wou=\r\nld be JUnit Cupcake\n- The runner and interfaces introduced in JUnit 4 would=\r\n be JUnit Donut\n- The runner and interfaces introduced in JUnit 5 would be =\r\nJUnit Eclair\n\nThanks,\n\n   David\n\n\nOn Mon, Dec 17, 2012 at 6:42 AM, Neale Up=\r\nstone\n&lt;neale.upstone@...&gt;wrote:\n\n&gt; **\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; On 14/12/12 00:32, Es=\r\nko Luontola wrote:\n&gt; &gt; David Saff wrote on 13.12.2012 17:47:\n&gt; &gt;&gt; There&#39;s b=\r\neen a lot of things we&#39;ve wanted to do\n&gt; &gt;&gt; all along with JUnit that I&#39;ve =\r\ndesigned first in my head the way they\n&gt; would\n&gt; &gt;&gt; have worked in a langua=\r\nge with lambdas, and then redesigned to fit the\n&gt; &gt;&gt; grain of a lambda-less=\r\n language. Assertions (and mocks) have especially\n&gt; &gt;&gt; contorted themselves=\r\n in ways that they might finally now be able to\n&gt; relax.\n&gt; &gt; Yes, assertion=\r\ns could probably get much benefit from lambdas.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I support the idea =\r\nof having assertions as a separate library which is\n&gt; &gt; decoupled from the =\r\ntesting framework (the same way as Hamcrest,\n&gt; &gt; FEST-Assert and probably o=\r\nthers). The testing framework would then focus\n&gt; &gt; fully on the test execut=\r\nion model (e.g. test isolation, execution order,\n&gt; &gt; rules and other metapr=\r\nogramming).\n&gt; +1 : Separate library would certainly help those of us who ar=\r\ne trying to\n&gt; manage large teams and to ensure they do things like use\n&gt; as=\r\nsertThat(blah, is(blah)) instead of assertEquals(blah, blah)\n&gt; (assertThat =\r\nis type safe for refactoring, where assertEquals isn&#39;t)\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; There is wi=\r\nde variablity in how assertions can be done (especially in\n&gt; &gt; different la=\r\nnguages). I don&#39;t have strong opinions about what an assert\n&gt; &gt; should be l=\r\nike, and seems that there are as many kinds of asserts as\n&gt; &gt; there are tes=\r\nting frameworks.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; There is less variablity in testing frameworks&#39; ex=\r\necution model, but\n&gt; &gt; those differences are often at a more fundamental le=\r\nvel (e.g. test\n&gt; &gt; isolation vs. shared state). I and others hold strong op=\r\ninions about\n&gt; them.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Thus I would like to be able to mix and match =\r\nthe frameworks and\n&gt; &gt; assertions separately, sometimes even using multiple=\r\n assertion libraries\n&gt; &gt; in the same test.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; - The fact that a D=\r\nescription is both the immutable single name of a\n&gt; test\n&gt; &gt;&gt; node, and a m=\r\nutable builder for the test structure, and then later an\n&gt; &gt;&gt; immutable ref=\r\nerence for the test structure, is exasperating.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; - The reliance on refl=\r\nectively-discovered constructors for extensibility\n&gt; &gt;&gt; causes some awkward=\r\nness.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; - The IDE-centric idea that one should be enable to enumerate al=\r\nl tests\n&gt; &gt;&gt; before any is run places some binding constraints, and should =\r\nbe at most\n&gt; &gt;&gt; optional in a world in which tests are often run by daemons=\r\n many more\n&gt; times\n&gt; &gt;&gt; a day than by humans.\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;ve noticed those as wel=\r\nl. I&#39;ve already addressed each of those in Jumi:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; - A testing framew=\r\nork must assign a unique immutable TestId for each\n&gt; &gt; test in a test class=\r\n, which is then used to send events of when the test\n&gt; &gt; was started, finis=\r\nhed, failed etc. The TestId implies a tree structure\n&gt; &gt; of tests (to be us=\r\ned in test result reports). Everything is expressed as\n&gt; &gt; immutable events=\r\n (Jumi relies heavily on Event Sourcing). See details at\n&gt; &gt; http://jumi.fi=\r\n/api/jumi-api/fi/jumi/api/drivers/SuiteNotifier.html\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; - The fi.jumi.=\r\napi.drivers.Driver which corresponds\n&gt; &gt; org.junit.runner.Runner requires a=\r\n zero-argument constructor. The test\n&gt; &gt; class et al is passed as method ar=\r\ngument to\n&gt; &gt; http://jumi.fi/api/jumi-api/fi/jumi/api/drivers/Driver.html#f=\r\nindTests\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; - Jumi starts executing tests as soon as possible, at both=\r\n the suite and\n&gt; &gt; test class levels. At suite level, test class execution =\r\nstarts\n&gt; &gt; asynchronously before all test classes are discovered (i.e. befo=\r\nre Jumi\n&gt; &gt; has finished traversing the directories containing test classes=\r\n). At\n&gt; &gt; test class level, more tests can be found during test execution (=\r\nfor\n&gt; &gt; example Specsy requires this) and the new test executions can be st=\r\narted\n&gt; &gt; asynchronously in parallel (depending on the testing framework an=\r\nd\n&gt; &gt; whether the user has disabled parallelism for that test class or the\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; whole suite).\n&gt; Nice! I like the idea of getting on with probably CPU b=\r\nound stuff while\n&gt; may be IO bound on class scan\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; - There are=\r\n as many perfect models of test status possibilities as there\n&gt; &gt;&gt; are deve=\r\nlopers. Passed/Failed? Passed/Failed/Skipped?\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Passed/Failed/Ignored, e=\r\ntc. The current design bakes one required system\n&gt; &gt;&gt; pretty deep into the =\r\ninternals, unnecessarily.\n&gt; &gt; That&#39;s been on my mind for a long time, but I=\r\n haven&#39;t yet figured out a\n&gt; &gt; good way to support all the variations, so I=\r\n&#39;m deferring the decision. I\n&gt; &gt; would love to hear your ideas.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; A v=\r\nery flexible way would be to allow tagging tests with arbitrary\n&gt; &gt; keyword=\r\ns, but then the problem will be that how each of those keywords\n&gt; &gt; should =\r\naffect the user interface. There would have to be at least some\n&gt; &gt; keyword=\r\ns with specific meaning, which brings us back to the original\n&gt; &gt; question =\r\nof which states to support.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; To get started we could list all the va=\r\nriations in use today and the use\n&gt; &gt; cases for using each of them (e.g. it=\r\n&#39;s an acceptance tests for a\n&gt; &gt; feature which has not yet been implemented=\r\n). I&#39;m hoping there to be 5 or\n&gt; &gt; less different reasons that are served b=\r\ny test statuses.\n&gt; I&#39;d love to see status improvements. A classic case is a=\r\nssumptions. We\n&gt; want to show failed assumptions on our Jenkins dashboard.\n=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Now, should the framework to which I&#39;d contribute time to fix th=\r\nese\n&gt; &gt;&gt; problems be called JUnit 5, or something entirely different? That&#39;=\r\ns\n&gt; &gt;&gt; another kettle of fish, with some interesting options to consider. L=\r\nooks\n&gt; &gt;&gt; like we have at least 9 months to consider them at length.\n&gt; &gt; 9 =\r\nmonths, like giving birth to a baby. I suppose the names of quite many\n&gt; &gt; =\r\npeople have been pondered for that long. :)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; JUnit&#39;s name is well kn=\r\nown, so it&#39;s a marketing bonus. On the other\n&gt; &gt; hand, the software industr=\r\ny moves quickly and good technology can get\n&gt; &gt; popular regardless of its n=\r\name.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; I think JUnit has a philosophy of simplicity. Delivering more\n&gt; =\r\nsimplicity would be worthy of the name JUnit 5 (or should 5,6,7 be\n&gt; skippe=\r\nd and call it JUnit 8 ;) )\n&gt;\n&gt; Neale\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this m=\r\nessage have been removed]\n\n\n",
