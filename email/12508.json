Some people recommended to <br/>\nhave a new vm for each test so that a tested class does not depends <br/>\non the ant environment, what does that actually mean? Can someone <br/>\npleas explain? I recently changed the forkmode=&quot;once&quot; in my ant and <br/>\nhope that it would speed up the build, but somehow a few UTs got <br/>\nNullPointerExceptions on certain objects when they are not supposed <br/>\nto. And it seems like it has something to do with delegation. Can <br/>\nsomeone help me clarify this?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks</div>",
