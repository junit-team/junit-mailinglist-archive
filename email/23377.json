It would also not rub me the wrong way if it<br/>\n&gt; was not he case that code that is written in a TDD manner turns out to be<br/>\n&gt; testable pretty much by definition.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; agreed<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Perhaps when I feel that I do something &quot;just for testing&quot; it is a good<br/>\n&gt; idea<br/>\n&gt; for me to reflect upon if there is some way that I can achieve the<br/>\n&gt; testability with other benefits as well. Perhaps now is not a good time to<br/>\n&gt; reflect so I write a note to myself to get back to the problem and reflect<br/>\n&gt; later.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; agreed.. //FIXME is an IDE-supported &#39;comment tag&#39;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; The whole testing private methods discussion would never rub me the wrong<br/>\n&gt; way either if I didn&#39;t feel that we chose to resort to technical voodoo in<br/>\n&gt; order to avoid changing how we generally approach problems and IMO are more<br/>\n&gt; or less guaranteed to miss out on an oportunity to learn.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The &quot;its not agile&quot; argument always rubs me the wrong way because it&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; pointless. Frankly I don&#39;t care about being agile unless it works better<br/>\n&gt; than something else I would be doing.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>neither do i<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; I do the things I do because I know no better way of doing them right now.<br/>\n&gt; If I could do less testing I would, since having lots of tests is also<br/>\n&gt; quite<br/>\n&gt; pointless in itself. It is the effects of having them that I am after. Or<br/>\n&gt; seemingly it is the effect of writing them that I am after. I write lots of<br/>\n&gt; tests because I know no better way of ensuring that my code has quality and<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>same here..and because i look for the highest value from my tests/coding I<br/>\ntry to integration/higher-level/emperical test as much as possible. However<br/>\nthere I sometimes need access to private methods to get the testing<br/>\nenvironment/parameters i need.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; of driving me to reflect daily about design that helps me improve as a<br/>\n&gt; programmer.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; If the point was lots of coverage and exercise every single method as a<br/>\n&gt; unit<br/>\n&gt; I would probably make all methods public... but it&#39;s not...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; By the way, I have come to find that the private keyword is pretty<br/>\n&gt; overrated<br/>\n&gt; :)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Sorry for the rant... I just need to do that at least once every year :)<br/>\n&gt; Anyone is free to disagree and it may very well be because they are smarter<br/>\n&gt; or better programmers than I am. If there is anything worth reflecting on<br/>\n&gt; in<br/>\n&gt; what I wrote then it would be &quot;don&#39;t follow the rules, go after the<br/>\n&gt; effects&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>+1.<br/>\nI&#39;d summarize my point with: &quot;lazyness is a virtue&quot; [1] &quot;except for the<br/>\ncompiler&quot;, but I&#39;d also be wrong!<br/>\n<br/>\n[1] <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://projectlombok.org/features/index.html\">http://projectlombok.org/features/index.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; /J<br/>\n&gt; -----------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Joakim Ohlrogge<br/>\n&gt; Twitter: @johlrogge<br/>\n&gt; Blog: johlrogge.wordpress.com<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>-- <br/>\nRegards,<br/>\nK.
