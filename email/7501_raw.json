April 2003 09:15 schrieb javainsel:\n&gt; Now let me =\r\nagain try to convince you that JUnit is only accepted\n&gt; today because of a =\r\npowerty of Java language.\nYou try again, okay.\n\n&gt; It is very simple.\nNo, it=\r\n&#39;s not that simple.\n\n&gt; If you try to correct yourself all the time as a dev=\r\neloper then you\n&gt; will apply this principle to the question, whether JUnit =\r\nand Test\n&gt; Driven Development (TDD) are really useful or whether they shoul=\r\nd be\n&gt; replaced by something better as soon as possible.\nThat&#39;s very plausi=\r\nble, but that&#39;s not a factual argument, just an ethical \nfingertip. Don&#39;t t=\r\nhink we&#39;re all closed-minded, not willingly to adopt modern \nand useful pro=\r\ngramming techniques. If we were, we weren&#39;t on this list. (That \nof course =\r\nalso is not a factual argument)\n\n&gt; Using Design by Contract can completely =\r\nmake JUnit und TDD obsolete.\nNo.\n\n&gt; Right now I&#39;m not sure if it can make i=\r\nt obsolete for all appliances.\nSo then why do you make such statements?\n\n&gt; =\r\nBut it can replace at least most usages of JUnit and TDD.\nNo. s/most/many/ =\r\nand I will agree.\n\n&gt; And it can provide many more benefits than JUnit and T=\r\nDD can offer.\nNo.\nIt can provide *different* and frequently the same benefi=\r\nts JUnit and TDD, \nthen perhaps in a more convenient way - because of being=\r\n more declarative.\n\n&gt; Look at that example.\n&gt;\n&gt; \t/*\n&gt; \t * precondition:  di=\r\nviders[n] !=3D 0\n&gt; \t * postcondition: result[n] =3D=3D denominator/dividers=\r\n[n]\n&gt; \t */\n&gt; \tint[] divide(int denominator, int[] dividers) {\n&gt; \t  int[] di=\r\nvisions =3D new int[dividers.length];\n&gt;\n&gt; \t  for (int i =3D 0; i &lt; dividers=\r\n.length; i++) {\n&gt; \t\tint divider =3D dividers[i];\n&gt; \t\tdivisions[i] =3D denom=\r\ninator / divider;\n&gt; \t  }\n&gt; \t  return divisions;\n&gt; \t}\nThis is a very conveni=\r\nent example of how DBC works.\nBut it covers only 1% of what is covered by U=\r\nnit Tests. Testing preconditions, \npostconditions and invariants is just a =\r\nvery small part of the whole fields \nof Unit Testing.\nAs well as the exampl=\r\ne doesn&#39;t show everything covered by DBC but just some \naspects of DBC, of =\r\ncourse preconditions and postconditions.\nThat is a point of intersection be=\r\ntween DBC and Unit Testing. But DBC is far \naway from covering all aspects =\r\ncovered by Unit Testing.\n\n&gt; Invariants would not be used here since invaria=\r\nnts apply to the class\n&gt; and not to methods. They can be used for interacti=\r\nons or dependencies\n&gt; between methods.\nYes.\n\n&gt; It should be very easy to mo=\r\ndify the java compiler to check whether\n&gt; the implementation obeys the prec=\r\nonditions and postconditions and\n&gt; invariants. If not, then either the impl=\r\nementation is buggy or the\n&gt; contract.\nWell, as I already said, don&#39;t discu=\r\nss that specific subtopic (modifying the \njava compiler) on this list, inst=\r\nead complain to someone working in SUN&#39;s \nJava team, go ahead and start a J=\r\nSR in the JCP or start an open source \nproject about DBC for Java, I&#39;m sure=\r\n if you go such a constructive way you \nwill have really much support.\n\nI r=\r\nequest that you a) don&#39;t blame JUnit users for using JUnit (my impression \n=\r\nis that you do) and b) don&#39;t try to convince JUnit users of using a differe=\r\nnt \napproach that virtually doesn&#39;t exist - as far as I know there are no \n=\r\nstandard tools for DBC in Java, especially no JSR, just a small set of \ncom=\r\nmercial tools, so DBC in Java is much too far from being mature and \napplic=\r\nable.\n\nYou of course may request support for an open source project or a JS=\r\nR within \nthe JCP, as already said I&#39;m pretty sure you&#39;ll find much support=\r\n for that.\n\n&gt; As an alternative you can use Design by Contract to automatic=\r\nally\n&gt; create test cases (including test data).\nSometimes DBC can do that, =\r\nsometimes DBC can&#39;t, especially if the problem is \ntoo complex.\n\n&gt; However =\r\nyou use Design by Contract: You save a lot of time compared\n&gt; to JUnit and =\r\nTDD. And you aren&#39;t driven to use TDD. You are free.\nWherever DBC can repla=\r\nce Unit Testing, this will probably be true.\nBut what about all those many =\r\ncases where DBC can&#39;t?\n\n&gt; Besides this you have a very nice documentation (=\r\nContracts), much\n&gt; more helpful than the JUnit test &quot;documentation&quot;.\nIt is =\r\ntrue that a documentation derived from declarations like those from DBC \nca=\r\nn be much more convenient than treating JUnit test suites as part of the \nd=\r\nocumentation, especially if it&#39;s all about the contract of a class, not \nab=\r\nout it&#39;s implementation.\n\nBut DBC can&#39;t replace Unit Testing in general, on=\r\nly in some specific cases.\n\n\nNow I provide a still quite simple example whe=\r\nre I believe DBC will not be \nable to replace Unit Testing. Documentation a=\r\nnd other parts of the code not \nrelated to testing / DBC are omitted for br=\r\nevity.\n\npublic class ARGVEnumeration implements Enumeration {\n    private S=\r\ntring[] args;\n    private int index;\n    private InputStream currentStream;=\r\n\n    public ARGVEnumeration(final String[] args) {\n        this.args =3D ar=\r\ngs;\n    }\n    public boolean hasMoreElements() {\n        return args.length=\r\n =3D=3D 0 && currentStream =3D=3D null || args.length &gt; 0 && \nindex &lt; args.=\r\nlength;\n    }\n    public Object nextElement() {\n        if (!hasMoreElement=\r\ns()) {\n            throw new NoSuchElementException();\n        } else {\n   =\r\n         if (args.length =3D=3D 0) {\n                return currentStream =\r\n=3D System.in;\n            } else {\n                if (currentStream !=3D =\r\nnull) {\n                    try {\n                        currentStream.clo=\r\nse();\n                    } catch (IOException e) {\n                       =\r\n /* ... */\n                    }\n                }\n                try {\n  =\r\n                  return currentStream =3D new FileInputStream(args[index++=\r\n]);\n                } catch (IOException e) {\n                   try { retu=\r\nrn nextElement(); } catch (NoSuchElementException \nne) { return null; }\n   =\r\n             }\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nAnd now a simple test:\npubl=\r\nic class ARGVEnumerationTest extends TestCase {\n    public void testEmpty()=\r\n {\n        ARGVEnumeration ae =3D new ARGVEnumeration(new String[0]);\n     =\r\n   assertTrue(ae.hasMoreElements());\n        assertSame(ae.nextElement(), S=\r\nystem.in);\n        assertFalse(ae.hasMoreElements());\n    }\n    public void=\r\n testOneElement() throws IOException {\n        ARGVEnumeration ae =3D new A=\r\nRGVEnumeration(new String[] \n{&quot;/etc/passwd&quot;});\n        assertTrue(ae.hasMor=\r\neElements());\n        InputStream in =3D (InputStream) ae.nextElement();\n  =\r\n      assertTrue(in instanceof FileInputStream);\n        in.close();\n      =\r\n  assertFalse(ae.hasMoreElements());\n    }\n    public void testMoreElements=\r\n() throws IOException {\n        String[] filelist =3D {&quot;/etc/passwd&quot;, &quot;/etc=\r\n/group&quot;, &quot;/etc/hosts&quot;, \n&quot;/etc/services&quot;};\n        ARGVEnumeration ae =3D ne=\r\nw ARGVEnumeration(filelist);\n        for (int i =3D 0; i &lt; filelist.length;=\r\n i++) {\n            assertTrue(ae.hasMoreElements());\n            InputStre=\r\nam in =3D (InputStream) ae.nextElement();\n            assertTrue(in instanc=\r\neof FileInputStream);\n            in.close();\n        }\n        assertFalse=\r\n(ae.hasMoreElements());\n    }\n}\n\n(Note that I am aware of that ARGVEnumerat=\r\nion will run a program into an \nendless loop if System.setOut() is invoked =\r\nwith null as argument, but I am \nsure that this will not be the only proble=\r\nm arising from invoking \nSystem.setOut(null) and I intentionally dropped a =\r\nsolution for that issue as \nbeing a) consuming much time and b) providing n=\r\no business value)\n\n\nI&#39;m really keen on reading how these tests could be rep=\r\nlaced by DBC.\n\n\nOr try using DBC for the following issues that are also add=\r\nressed by Unit \nTesting:\n* Test network protocol timeout features\n* Test th=\r\nat class A uses classes through interface B more restricted than the \ncontr=\r\nact of B allows (in Unit Testing, you use a mock object implementing B \nto =\r\nprotocol how A accesses B)\n* Test that the file generated by a class adhere=\r\ns to a specification\n* Performance tests\n* Get code coverage (imagine you h=\r\nave a broken code and a contract but the \ncode is only executed in some cri=\r\ntical abnormal situations?) and statistics\n* Test something that&#39;s not just=\r\n a simple precondition, postcondition or \ninvariant? Even not all problems =\r\naddressed by &quot;normal&quot; Unit Testing can be \nreduced to simple preconditions,=\r\n postconditions and invariants expressible by \nDBC.\n\nI persist in my point =\r\nof view that Exceptions, Assertions, Unit Testing and \nDesign by Contract a=\r\nre not competing but complementary approaches on the same \naspect: Increase=\r\n the stability and robustness of code and decrease the number \nof bugs.\nBut=\r\n &quot;DBC is better than JUnit&quot; is like saying &quot;Bolts are better than glue&quot;. \nE=\r\nspecially when there are many things you can do with Unit Testing / JUnit \n=\r\nthat you can&#39;t do with DBC.\n\nUnit Testing is not a subset of DBC and DBC is=\r\n not a subset of Unit Testing. \nThere&#39;s just an intersection where one of t=\r\nhese can replace the other, but \nthat intersection is much smaller than you=\r\n believe.\n\n\nBye\n- -- \nITCQIS GmbH\nChristian Wolfgang Hujer\nGesch=E4ftsf=FCh=\r\nrender Gesellschafter\nTelefon: +49  (0)89  27 37 04 37\nTelefax: +49  (0)89 =\r\n 27 37 04 39\nE-Mail: Christian.Hujer@...\nWWW: http://www.itcqis.com/=\r\n\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\nVersion: GnuPG v1.0.7 (GNU/Linux)\n\niD8DBQE+j=\r\nLmBzu6h7O/MKZkRAhdXAJ0R3H4jr0wjRVhzEMJlVEFBeC3KmQCdGlqX\nBH2u8o8rcR3bAf8lrII=\r\nyJNk=3D\n=3DalTY\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----\n\n\n",
