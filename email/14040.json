This is a validation that is<br/>\n&gt; run before any other test in the AllTests suite, if it fails<br/>\n&gt; no other test is run.  You get a single failure, fix the<br/>\n&gt; web.xml file and then run again.  In order to get this same<br/>\n&gt; behavior in JUnit4 I would have to duplicate the @BeforeClass<br/>\n&gt; and @AfterClass annotations into every TestCase.  Annotations<br/>\n&gt; in this sense are really starting to sound like Advices in<br/>\n&gt; the AOP world.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Similarly, we have functional tests that use a type of<br/>\n&gt; validation like the one I mentioned before [...].  The<br/>\n&gt; validation checks the WSDL [...].  If they don&#39;t match<br/>\n&gt; [...then...] running the tests don&#39;t make too much sense,<br/>\n&gt; so we throw a failure and refuse to run any other tests.

In this case, I might put the test in <br/>\nthe &#39;setUp&#39; method of the new base class  (if I&#39;m confident that all <br/>\nchild class setUp methods call their superclass setUp method!  ;-)  <br/>\nand set a static flag to indicate if the &quot;before all tests&quot; check <br/>\nwas done, and another flag to indicate if it was successful or not.  <br/>\n(If it was run, but it was not successful, then I don&#39;t want to run <br/>\nthe tests.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve used this primarily to support configuration flags like &quot;run <br/>\nthe tests that connect to the database&quot; (or not) and &quot;run the really <br/>\ntime-consuming tests&quot; (or not).  When doing this, I typically also <br/>\noverride the constructor and &#39;setName&#39; method, to call a static <br/>\nfunction that modifies the test case name to show that it&#39;s not <br/>\nbeing run.  I&#39;ll change &quot;testThis&quot; to &quot;- NOT RUN -  testThis&quot;, for <br/>\nexample, for test cases I will chose not to run.  This trick may not <br/>\nbe as useful in your case; I&#39;m doing selective disabling of just <br/>\nsome of the tests.</div>",
