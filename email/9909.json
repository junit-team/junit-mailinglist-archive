All you<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; need are two more events, and since you can fix that in one place....<br/>\n&gt;  &gt;<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; It&#39;s entirely possible that JUnit-addons Test Runner already does this.<br/>\n&gt;  &gt;<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; Understand, I&#39;m not trying to squash your enthusiasm for AOP. You just<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; have that Golden Hammer look in your eye....<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Yep, this does work fine, if you don&#39;t have any fixture-setup code in your<br/>\n&gt; testcase itself.  However, many people haven&#39;t refactored all fixture <br/>\n&gt; code into<br/>\n&gt; setUp() and tearDown().  If this is the case, there could be some <br/>\n&gt; time-consuming<br/>\n&gt; fixture code in the test methods themselves.  This would mean that checking<br/>\n&gt; times after setUp() and before tearDown() would still be counting the <br/>\n&gt; fixture<br/>\n&gt; execution time in with the Class Under Test execution time.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I understand... that&#39;s the fault of the programmer not using JUnit as <br/>\nexpected. If the programmer wants JUnit to report accurate times, the <br/>\nprogrammer ought to put setup code in setUp(). :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Having a listener is another viable Plain Java approach, but you would <br/>\n&gt; still<br/>\n&gt; have to manually fire the listener before and after you actual <br/>\n&gt; invocation of the<br/>\n&gt; class under test.  This is the type of non-refactorable duplication that <br/>\n&gt; AOP solves.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I see... that would be nice: using AOP to instrument an event source <br/>\nwithout hardcoding when the events occur. That is neat. (I haven&#39;t <br/>\nlearned much about the practical use of AOP, as you might be able to tell.)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I&#39;m not advocating AOP in all cases, in fact I think you should try hard <br/>\n&gt; to find<br/>\n&gt; a Plain Java solution that works before resorting to AOP.  I&#39;m just <br/>\n&gt; trying to<br/>\n&gt; illustrate that it could be useful in a specific scenario:  Monitoring <br/>\n&gt; execution<br/>\n&gt; time of the class under test if 1) you have fixture setup code in your test<br/>\n&gt; methods and 2) the execution time of that fixture setup code could <br/>\n&gt; obscure the<br/>\n&gt; actual execution time of the Class Under Test.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I can see the general use of AOP for generating events on behalf of an <br/>\nevent source. Good idea.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Most likely this isn&#39;t the situation of the original poster, so it doesn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; matter.  We can drop this thread before people start complaining :).<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Let them complain. This list is such low traffic that OT stuff is not a <br/>\nproblem here. :)<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJ. B.
