B. Rainsberger&quot; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; Kent:\n&gt; \n&gt; You&#39;ve made this suggestion a few times recently, and I was hoping you would\n&gt; elaborate on it. Do you have a specific example in mind of how a TestSetup\n&gt; indicated that something was wrong.\n&gt; \n&gt; I have written an article on how singletons can defeat unit testing. I have\n&gt; observed that if a test relies on the state of a singleton, then there may\n&gt; be a desire to do one-time setup code and *that* is the sign of a code\n&gt; smell. Can you offer a different example? I&#39;d really like the opportunity to\n&gt; learn from it.\n\nFor me, it is not a question of testing singletons.  It is a question of waiting\nfor a configuration file to be read, a logger hierarchy to be set up, a Component Manager\nto be populated, a Context to be popluated, the test to be run, and everything to be\ntorn down.  This occurs for _every_ test in the testcase.  The framework in question\nis well tested and scalable, the tests are for the Components loaded into the Component\nManager.\n\nAnother example is testing RMI resources.  The testcase needs to set up the RMI\nserver code once because you will inevitably get a SocketException claiming that\nthe port you want to listen to is already bound.  In this case, the common TestCase\nclass is not sufficient.\n\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt; JBR.\n&gt; \n&gt; ----- Original Message -----\n&gt;  &gt; Your FAQ suggests that for one-time setup code you need to run\n&gt;  &gt; it in a TestSuite.\n&gt; \n&gt; This is what TestSetup is for. Wrap the suite in a subclass of\n&gt; TestSetup, override setUp() (and maybe tearDown()) in your subclass,\n&gt; and it only gets run once.\n&gt; \n&gt; Alternatively, you could consider how to untangle your design so you\n&gt; didn&#39;t need one-time setup.\n&gt; \n&gt; Kent\n&gt; \n&gt; _________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Get your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com/intl.asp\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
