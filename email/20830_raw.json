To this end, I understand\nthat a framework such as jMock can be used.\n\nSo far, so good. But I find JUnit to be extremely useful for writing\nintegration, system and user acceptance tests as well.\n\nHere&#39;s my question: what is the official position of the JUnit community on\nusing JUnit to do larger scale tests? Is there a better framework, or is it\ncommon practice to use JUnit for these tests as well?\n\n-- \nJan Kroeze\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n",
