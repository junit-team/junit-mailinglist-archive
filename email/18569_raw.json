Do you really want your tests /not/ to be isolated?\n\n^^^^^^^^^^\n\nYes, I want the test cases to be isolated, that is test 2 fails and test\n5 can still pass... that&#39;s why I need to use the 3rd party tool like\nJUnit, otherwise, I would write my own test cases.\n\nBut I don&#39;t see by create each instance of the test class can ensure\nisolation... for example, if I have a test #2 that add a new user to the\nsystem, and I expect an error (password not strict enough, for example),\nand this test fails, that is it adds the user to the system. Normally,\nif I have a test that adds a user, I would delete the user afterward,\nbut for this case, since I didn&#39;t expect the user to be added, I don&#39;t\ndo the cleaning up. Then on my test #5, I check how many users in the\nsystem, I would expect none, and the test will fail because the previous\ntest already added the user by error. (Sure, in this simple case, I can\ncheck the result and if the user is successfully added, I can delete,\nbut I just want to give an example, other cases may not as so easy). So,\nI don&#39;t see a benefit of create a new instance, the tests still get\naffected.\n\n\n&gt; 2. Do the tests run quickly enough even if you &quot;waste&quot; the resources?\n\nWell, right now it still runs quick enough... but I don&#39;t know if I\nwrite more tests into the class it will be fast or not... I have to\nparse an xml file to get all the parameters for the tests, and I rather\nparse once for all the tests to keep in the system than to parse over\nand over the file for each test case because each time a new instance is\ncreated.\n\nThanks for your clarification, though,\n\nVietchau\n\n&gt; Take care.\n&gt; -- \n&gt; J.
