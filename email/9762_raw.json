For example, Cactus \ntests (requires container) vs. non-Cactus tests (no container required).\n\nI would like to find some other approach which lets me be more flexible about \ngrouping the tests.  I would especially like something that allows groups to \noverlap.  For example, I may want to run a subset of both Cactus and non-Cactus \ntests related to a specific area of the application (because the entire suite of \ntests takes too long to run iteratively in a Test-Driven-Development mode).\n\nIs there any type of test runner or documented suite pattern which will let me \ndo this?\n\nI would still prefer for the decision of what &quot;group&quot; a test falls into to be \nmade by a property of the test class itself, rather than having to maintain a \nhardcoded list of test class names in some other place (since this is less \nlikely to get updated, or may get updated incorrectly).\n\nThanks,\nChad\n\nP.S.  I know I could probably modify the existing code to do this, but I&#39;m \nlooking for something simpler, which would also preferably handle the directory \nrecursing and test-finding rather than having to hardcode all that logic.\n\n\n\n\n",
