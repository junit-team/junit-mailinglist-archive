Even now, I still find myself<br/>\n&gt;having to do some convincing whenever I try to tell people that it&#39;s<br/>\n&gt;okay to remove &quot;final&quot; or make a private method &quot;package protected&quot; if<br/>\n&gt;it means that it will receive more testing.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I think the pendulum will swing back eventually and that we will find<br/>\n&gt;a happy medium between the two goals.<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I suspect it might, but part of me feels that the access protection <br/>\nmechanisms in languages are justly poorly suited for what we want to do <br/>\nnow. I think one problem, though, is that it much of the advice on <br/>\nprotection that we hear comes from framework and API developers. <br/>\nFrameworks and APIs are great, but I&#39;m convinced that many of the rules <br/>\nare different for run of the mill application code. Not everything is an <br/>\nAPI.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck on the book. Can you say what the topic is?<br/>\n<br/>\nMichael Feathers<br/>\nwww.objectmentor.com</div>",
