But today everyone uses a <br/>\n&gt; runner so<br/>\n&gt; the design of a new framework (SuiteRunner) would most likely be <br/>\n&gt; different.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Could you clarify what you mean by &quot;not need a runner&quot; and how that <br/>\ninfluenced the design of TestResult?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; Test Sequencing<br/>\n&gt;&gt; ---------------<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; But it&#39;s clear that a lot of thought went into JUnit&#39;s design.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; So what is it that makes &quot;sequential tests&quot; undesirable?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; if every test share the same resources, you can potentially have some <br/>\n&gt; very<br/>\n&gt; tricky problems:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;    your testA screws up one field of your suite<br/>\n&gt;    testB.... testY run perfectly<br/>\n&gt;    testZ fails<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; it can be really difficult to discover that testZ was failing because <br/>\n&gt; of testA.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yes, but isn&#39;t setUp supposed to take care of that kind of problem? <br/>\nInstead of creating a fixture in the constructor and reusing it in each <br/>\ntest method -- hoping that testA doesn&#39;t screw up the fixture in a way <br/>\nthat causes testZ to fail -- you just recreate the fixture anew before <br/>\neach test method.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll I can see you are buying by creating a new instance for each test <br/>\nmethod invocation is that if people screw up their setUp method, it <br/>\nstill doesn&#39;t matter. Is there something else I haven&#39;t seen?<br/>\n<br/>\nbv<br/>\n--<br/>\nBill Venners<br/>\nArtima Software, Inc.<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.artima.com\">http://www.artima.com</a></div>",
