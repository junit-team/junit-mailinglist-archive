But it was *never*\n&gt;&gt;&gt; legitimate to make a virtue of necessity, to say (as you do) that\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;separation is the solution.&quot; Now that you *can* drive your UIs\n&gt;&gt;&gt; from JUnit, and therefore you can *fully* test your UIs, your\n&gt;&gt;&gt; claim is illegitimate, and moreover encourages the\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;anti-test-infection.&quot;\n\nRon Jeffries Sun May 2, 2004  2:55 pm\n&gt;&gt; I still don&#39;t have the necessary skill to do very well what Thomas\n&gt;&gt; rightly recommends\n\nCan you write a JUnit testcase? Then you can any of several j.a.R-\nextending packages. Try it, it&#39;s easy. (Esp for Swing--Abbot&#39;s SWT\nsupport is almost as good, and we&#39;re hoping to make it equivalent by\nthe end of the summer.)\n\nJ. B. Rainsberger Sun May 2, 2004 7:37 pm (rearranged)\n&gt; I hope that readers do not interpret your remark to mean that\n&gt; separation is ineffective.\n\nSee above.\n\n&gt; Separation is, however, a majority of the solution. It is easily 80%\n&gt; of the solution, if not more. \n\nFalse. You are claiming that a properly designed UI need not be fully\ntested. This is\n\n* merely speculative: for all your design, if you haven&#39;t tested, you\n  don&#39;t know that it works. (I might add that the vast majority of\n  customers care much more that the code they&#39;ve bought works as\n  specified than that it is well designed.)\n\n* a bad practice that all-too-easily leads to worse practice (as\n  argued in &quot;fighting the anti-test-infection&quot; above)\n\n* anachronistic: the tooling problems that formerly lent aid and\n  comfort to your view have been rectified.\n\nI will go so far as to claim, ceteris paribus, better one&#39;s code be\nthoroughly tested (presuming it passes those tests :-) than well\ndesigned. (I will also claim that thorough testing promotes good\ndesign, but that&#39;s because I&#39;m a TDD true believer.)\n\n\n",
