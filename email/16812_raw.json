Just in case some=\r\none else runs into the \nsame problem. I first tried copying the tools.jar f=\r\nile into the JRE \ndirectory, that got me past the first problem, but then t=\r\nhe compiles \nfailed, because they were also looking in the JRE directory. T=\r\nhen I \ntried modifying the registry. That still didn&#39;t work. In the end I \n=\r\nhad to uninstall the JRE.\n\nThanks again\nJanet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
