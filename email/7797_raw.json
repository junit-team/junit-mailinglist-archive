It&#39;s just a few setString() and executeQuery(). I don&#39;t \nknow if it\n&gt; worth the effort to mock the infrastructure to test these few \nstatements really\n&gt; got executed.\n\nWe don&#39;t use the database directly. We use the create feature of the \nframework we use. And that framework uses EJB and CMP to persist the \nobject.\n\n&gt; P.S. For some reason my mails to this list only get listed after I \nsent it for\n&gt; 2 days. This make the conversion not very interactive. Does anyone \nhas this\n&gt; problem?\n\nMy postings are sent after half a day or sometimes after one day.\n\nI don&#39;t like it that every posting is read before it is published in \nthis forum. This is not necessary. Imagine Sun doing this in their \nforum. They don&#39;t need that censorship nor does this forum need it. \nIt has only disadvantages.\n\n\n",
