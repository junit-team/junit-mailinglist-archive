I think you\ncould also make an argument that it would be better if the behavior\nwas different.\n\nIn my view, the behavior is in fact an artifact of an implementation\ndetail - namely that asserts indicate failures by throwing an\nexception. It could be made the case that JUnit &quot;should&quot; report those\nfailing asserts as failing asserts, not as unexpected exceptions.\nBasically, the current behavior masks the true test failure.\n\nFrankly, I have a hunch that the best solution to this problem\nactually is to split the test in two, that is, to not mix &quot;expected&quot;\nand &quot;assert&quot; in the same test method.\n\nCheers, Ilja\n\n2008/12/30 kentb &lt;kentb@...&gt;:\n&gt; Yosef,\n&gt;\n&gt; The behavior you describe is what I would expect to see. In the test, you\n&gt; declared that an ArrayIndexOutOfBounds exception would be thrown. It was not\n&gt; thrown, so the test fails. The error message says that the &quot;wrong&quot; exception\n&gt; that was thrown was an AssertionError, which is generated by the\n&gt; assertTrue(false). The &quot;expected=...&quot; means that a test can fail if no\n&gt; exception is thrown or if the wrong exception is thrown.\n&gt;\n&gt; Regards,\n&gt;\n&gt; Kent Beck\n&gt; Three Rivers Institute\n&gt;\n&gt; _____\n&gt;\n&gt; From: junit@yahoogroups.com [mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com] On Behalf Of\n&gt; yosefshariat\n&gt; Sent: Tuesday, December 30, 2008 1:10 AM\n&gt; To: junit@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Subject: [junit] Priority of Assertion?\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi\n&gt; I use &quot;@Test(expected = AnyClassException.class&quot;) and one\n&gt; &quot;assertTrue(false)&quot; together for example following code:\n&gt;\n&gt; @Test(expected = ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException.class)\n&gt; public void test()\n&gt; {\n&gt; String s[] = new String[]{&quot;1&quot;};\n&gt; assertTrue(false);\n&gt; System.out.println(s[10]);\n&gt; }\n&gt;\n&gt; I expect to see an assertion but I see following error:\n&gt; java.lang.Exception: Unexpected exception,\n&gt; expected&lt;java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException&gt; but\n&gt; was&lt;java.lang.AssertionError&gt;..\n&gt;\n&gt; In your opinion, this test must be Assertion or Exception.\n&gt; In &quot;JUnit&quot; we cannot use &quot;@Test(expected = AnyClassException.class&quot;)\n&gt; and Assertion together at the same time.\n&gt; In my opinion this test must be failed for &quot;assertion&quot; and not for\n&gt; ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException.\n&gt; Is this a bug in JUnit or my test is wrong and shouldn&#39;t use two item\n&gt; together?\n&gt; Tanks.\n&gt;\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt;\n&gt; \n\n",
