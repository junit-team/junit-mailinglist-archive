Essentially, the model has a\n&gt; lis=\r\ntener infrastructure and if the user changes the value of the class\n&gt; attri=\r\nbute the appropriate event is supposed to fire.  The typical\n&gt; setter/gette=\r\nr looks like this:\n&gt; \n&gt; class MyBean extends Listenable {\n&gt;     String valu=\r\ne;\n&gt; \n&gt;     public String getValue() {\n&gt;         return value;\n&gt;     }\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n     public void setValue(String newValue) {\n&gt;         fireAttributeChanged=\r\nEvent(&quot;value&quot;, value, newValue);\n&gt;         value =3D newValue;\n&gt;     }\n&gt; }\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; I need to test that the setters fire the appropriate event, and that t=\r\nhe\n&gt; event attribute name is correct.  I want a test harness to essentially=\r\n\n&gt; collect all the setters and getters and change the value to ensure that\n=\r\n&gt; the event is sent as expected.  Then I want to run that against all my\n&gt; =\r\ndomain models.\n&gt; \n&gt; My understanding is that I need to generate a suite, an=\r\nd add the test\n&gt; instances to that suite.  I&#39;ve upgraded to JUnit 4 because=\r\n I think it is\n&gt; designed better.  I&#39;m just at a loss as to how to start.  =\r\nWith JUnit 4,\n&gt; individual tests are marked with an annotation.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; [No=\r\nn-text portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt;\n\n\n\n",
