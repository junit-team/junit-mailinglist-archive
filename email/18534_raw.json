I wa\nlooking at www.mockobjects.com, and on the right side of the page it lists\n&quot;implementations&quot;, and for Java it says jMock, EasyMock, and rMock.\n\nWhat does it mean by implementations? What standard or specification are\nthey implementing, if any?\n\nOr are they really very different things that only use the &quot;concept&quot; of mock\nobjects, but implement it very differently?\n\nAny advice for a beginner as to which of those three implementations to look\nat (any difference in functionality, robustness, or any other criteria?).\nLooking at their websites I couldn&#39;t really tell what the main differences\nare.\n\nThanks.\n-- \nView this message in context: http://www.nabble.com/Using-mock-objects-tf2812332.html#a7848015\nSent from the JUnit - User mailing list archive at Nabble.com.\n\n\n",
