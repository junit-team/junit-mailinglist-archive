I don&#39;t doubt you had a <br/>\nproblem, but I don&#39;t understand what it was. How do non-virtual <br/>\nfunctions imply that you couldn&#39;t tell  if it was making the right <br/>\ncalls? You say &quot;non-virtual&quot;. Was this a C++ library?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  I used a DOM parsing <br/>\n&gt; library a few months ago which, by all appearances, didn&#39;t let you <br/>\n&gt; create a document in memory.  You had to either point it to a URL or the <br/>\n&gt; disk.  So, to write tests that could otherwise easily be written in <br/>\n&gt; memory, you needed either a server or a scattering of files on disk.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>That seems OK to me. If the library doesn&#39;t need a means of creating <br/>\ndocuments in memory for its own purposes, then it shouldn&#39;t add those <br/>\njust for testing. Had it done so, you would have used those functions. <br/>\nHowever, because it didn&#39;t you tested the code in a more realistic <br/>\nfashion that is more likely to expose bugs. That&#39;s a good thing.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow if the library had a legitimate need to create documents in memory <br/>\nfor reasons other than testing, then I would add such functions. However <br/>\nI wouldn&#39;t do it just for testing.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n﻿Elliotte Rusty Harold  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:elharo@...\">elharo@...</a><br/>\nJava I/O 2nd Edition Just Published!<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.cafeaulait.org/books/javaio2/\">http://www.cafeaulait.org/books/javaio2/</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0596527500/ref=nosim/cafeaulaitA/\">http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0596527500/ref=nosim/cafeaulaitA/</a></div>",
