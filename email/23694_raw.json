Ok so I wrote a simple test that shows a JFrame and uses Java Rob=\r\not to click on it. Works fine run in Eclipse on Mac as an application or JU=\r\nnit test but fails when run as JUnit plugin test. Frame would show 1 out of=\r\n 5 or so times. Removing all unneeded plugins resulted in frame always bein=\r\ng shown but the click never seems to happen.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I also tried Window L=\r\nicker and the included Calculator test(s) - same thing... runs as a JUnit T=\r\nest but fails as a JUnit Plugin Test. One time the frame was shown, but not=\r\nhing happened (so the test failed). The other times, the frame didn&#39;t even =\r\nshow. Tried removing all VM args and unnecessary plugins.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Is this =\r\nrelated to the args that Eclipse uses to run plugin tests on Mac? Or the co=\r\nre plugins included to run the tests? Or...?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Shaun.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- I=\r\nn junit@yahoogroups.com, Dale Emery &lt;dale@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Hi whoever y=\r\nou are,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hi - thanks for your reply. I&#39;m actually using Alex =\r\nRuiz&#39;s FEST for our testing and it works quite well on Windows. With or wit=\r\nhout FEST on the Mac, I can&#39;t seem to get any UI tests to run. The initial =\r\nframe/window comes up in some cases but I can&#39;t do much more than that. Whe=\r\nn running JUnit tests (again with or without FEST), I don&#39;t even see the fr=\r\name.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I&#39;ve gone through what docs there are for FEST and ha=\r\nve read the blog/article but I can&#39;t figure it out.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I&#39;v=\r\ne used FEST to test Swing code on a toy project:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; https://github.com/d=\r\nhemery/towers.dead\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Later I restarted the project and used Wind=\r\nowLicker instead:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; https://github.com/dhemery/Towers\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; It&#39;s=\r\n been a while since I visited either project, but I think the (few) UI test=\r\ns run. Neither version of the code does much, so there aren&#39;t many UI tests=\r\n. The older one (which uses FEST) has more features and tests.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n I wrote all of this code on Macs running Snow Leopard and Eclipse Ganymede=\r\n. I haven&#39;t tried it on Lion or Helios.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Dale\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; --\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; Dale Emery\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Consultant to software teams and leaders\n&gt; &gt; &gt; http:/=\r\n/dhemery.com\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; [Non-text portions of this m=\r\nessage have been removed]\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; [Non-text portions of =\r\nthis message have been removed]\n&gt;\n\n\n\n",
