For method that the values are not defined until running as random, or takes time like  schedule (should we write a test for method is scheduled to run within 1 hours). Applying above two rules, we can abstract the library code and use Mock object to have &#39;Evident data&#39;, we focus to test our business code not what library assume to do (we think random, schedule do the good job already - some cases, library does not do like expected but detecting it is another story).<br/>\n<br/>\nRegards,<br/>\nHai<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.haiphucnguyen.net/blog/\">http://www.haiphucnguyen.net/blog/</a><br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;J.

I think of randomness as generating a <br/>\n stream of numbers, so depend on &quot;a stream of numbers&quot; rather than a <br/>\n &quot;random number generator&quot;. Then, in production, use a &quot;random number <br/>\n generator&quot; implementation of the &quot;stream of numbers&quot;. It&#39;ll just work.<br/>\n -- <br/>\n J. B.
