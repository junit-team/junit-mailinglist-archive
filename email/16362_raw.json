Simply stating that X line was executed Y=\r\n \n&gt; times is of marginal use to me if I can&#39;t map back to see \n&gt; exactly /h=\r\now/ that line was executed. I don&#39;t recall whether \n&gt; EMMA does this. Any o=\r\nther suggestions? Commercial version of \n&gt; jCoverage?\n&gt; \n&gt; Why do I need th=\r\nis? At first, I created a custom Javadoc \n&gt; taglet that developers would ad=\r\nd to their class-under-test&#39;s \n&gt; method comments, to the tune of:\n&gt; \n&gt;    /=\r\n**\n&gt;     * @... =3D FooTest#testAddBar()\n&gt;     * @... =3D FooTe=\r\nst#testAddThreeBars()\n&gt;     */\n&gt;    public void addBar(Bar bar) { ... }\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; This would insert appropriate Javadoc links to the relevant \n&gt; test metho=\r\nds. But this is unwieldy, and certainly an \n&gt; unrealistic requirement for t=\r\nhe developers.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; Yahoo! Groups Links\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n",
