However, here=E2=80=99s a quick summary of where I see the real value-=\r\nadd for this feature: large enterprise customers who have large regression =\r\nsuites.  These are people who could use the dependencies to identify the ca=\r\nuse of a regression failure and therefore pin-point the responsible party m=\r\nuch more easily.  Also, since large companies usually have difficulty adopt=\r\ning new tools (i.e. politics, cost of training, etc.), they would benefit m=\r\nost from having this feature in JUnit itself rather than adopting a new too=\r\nl.\r\n\r\nAs a disclaimer, most of my corporate experience in is companies with fewe=\r\nr than 20 engineers: in these situations, you usually already know who to t=\r\nalk to ;-).  In fact, the example I gave isn=E2=80=99t even real; I just ma=\r\nde it up!  However, I can speak from my limited experience to answer a few =\r\nof these questions.  James, please provide your input as well since you hav=\r\ne a more pressing =E2=80=9Creal-world=E2=80=9D need.\r\n\r\n* What is the magnitude of the value? (That is, how long does it take to f=\r\nind the most-fundamental error when you have one test failing vs. when you =\r\nhave many?)\r\n* How many people would use dependencies?\r\n\r\nI would also add =E2=80=9CWhat kind of people would use dependencies?=E2=\r\n=80=9D\r\n\r\nI think our target audience here are regression suite maintenance engineer=\r\ns in large corporations.  With lots of moving parts, lots of engineers, and=\r\n a large regression suite, the value of dependencies is incredible as the t=\r\nests allow for automated identification of the group/person most responsibl=\r\ne for breaking the build/test run.  You could easily imagine that for a pro=\r\nject with 500 engineers letting the computer send an e-mail to the most res=\r\nponsible party based on the tests that fail could greatly reduce maintenanc=\r\ne overhead for the regression engineers for transient errors.  This feature=\r\n would then free the maintenance engineers to focus on code that seems cons=\r\ntantly out of whack.  Add in the fact that a company of that size may have =\r\ntrouble adopting a new tool to automat this process, and you see that this =\r\nprovides a lot of value to large, corporate customers.\r\n\r\n* What is the cost of creating the dependencies?\r\n* What is the cost of maintaining the dependencies?\r\n* What is the cost of teaching about dependencies?\r\n\r\nI feel that these are rather minimal.  Discovering a missing dependency wo=\r\nuld simply involve gaining extraneous information about a failure rather th=\r\nan a succinct report, possibly leading to a few false leads for fixers.  Th=\r\ne only time this would be expensive would be for classes shared over a larg=\r\ne portion of a software project.  I=E2=80=99m not certain how often this si=\r\ntuation would occur.\r\n\r\n* What is the cost to people who don&#39;t use dependencies?\r\n\r\nI would say none since they can just ignore this functionality, but I feel=\r\n like there=E2=80=99s a nuance to this question that I am missing.\r\n\r\n* Do the dependencies ever provide misleading results? How frequently? At =\r\nwhat cost?\r\n\r\nI have punted this idea around a lot as well.  Assuming that the dependenc=\r\nies are, in fact, correctly set, the only problem that I foresee is that a =\r\nsingle failure in a common class could mask a lot of other, unrelated error=\r\ns under the 80-20 solution because *any* dependent test fixture would be sk=\r\nipped for a single failure in a dependency test fixture.  However, this is =\r\none of the trade-offs of marking dependencies on the fixture level rather t=\r\nhan the method level.\r\n\r\n* What is the cost and opportunity cost of both the initial implementation=\r\n of dependencies and the maintenance of the code? (This is primarily a conc=\r\nern for David and I as our implementation budget for JUnit is so tight, but=\r\n the opportunity cost is a factor for everyone.)\r\n\r\nWell, I can=E2=80=99t really speak to this since I haven=E2=80=99t develop=\r\ned for JUnit before and since I can=E2=80=99t see myself needing this featu=\r\nre in the near future, but I do have the following suggestion.  Since this =\r\nfeature really benefits our large enterprise customers and since this featu=\r\nre is being suggested in order to allow our corporate customers to avoid ad=\r\nding a new tool, I suggest the following approach: let=E2=80=99s hash out a=\r\n spec=E2=80=94I think we are reasonably close to one already, but I will de=\r\nfer, again, to those with more experience in larger enterprises=E2=80=94and=\r\n then state that we will support/maintain this feature if someone else is w=\r\nilling to write it, write it and maintain it for a year, or meet some other=\r\n criteria whereby this feature is an even trade for our community.  Since w=\r\ne are considering this feature more out of concerns for corporate needs rat=\r\nher than out of a technical philosophy, I think that it is only fair for =\r\n=E2=80=9Ccorporate=E2=80=9D to drive this feature=E2=80=99s implementation =\r\nand help out a bit in its maintenance.\r\n\r\nJust my two cents,\r\n\r\nRocco\r\n\r\nFrom: junit@yahoogroups.com [mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com] On Behalf Of Ke=\r\nnt Beck\r\nSent: Wednesday, January 06, 2010 3:03 PM\r\nTo: junit@yahoogroups.com\r\nSubject: Re: [junit] Order of execution for tests\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRocco,\r\n\r\nThank you for the complete and carefully considered example.

The calculation and=\r\n presentation of each of these indices is rather involved, especially given=\r\n the amount of background material required for regulatory compliance, so y=\r\nou have a separate three-tier class structure for each index. Each index ha=\r\ns a few =E2=80=9Chelper classes=E2=80=9D that are shared among the three in=\r\ndices and also between the logic and data layers: consumer, consumer region=\r\n (a group of consumers within a particular region), and some analysis class=\r\nes. On top of the presentation layer for each tier, there is a single =E2=\r\n=80=9Creporter=E2=80=9D class that collates the three index reports, provid=\r\nes some summary data, and personalizes the package for the individual recip=\r\nients.\r\n&gt;\r\n&gt; So, if you imagine that each of these parts is implemented in a single c=\r\nlass=E2=80=94I=E2=80=99ve found this organization to be pretty reasonable i=\r\nn the past=E2=80=94you would have a few classes: Consumer, ConsumerRegion, =\r\nConsumerAnalysis at the bottom, then a single class for each tier of each i=\r\nndex (SpendingDataLayer, SpendingLogicLayer, SpendingPresentationLayer, Inc=\r\nomeDataLayer, etc.), and then a final Reporter class at the top. The logic =\r\nlayers may also call upon the analysis classes for certain common statistic=\r\nal functions. The data layers would, in addition to poking directly into th=\r\ne database, utilize the =E2=80=9Chelper classes=E2=80=9D for some basic DB =\r\naccess. You could also imagine having a single test class for each of the a=\r\nbove classes (also reasonable in my experience).\r\n&gt;\r\n&gt; In JUnit, then, you would say that the ReporterTestFixture depends upon =\r\nthe SpendingPresentationLayerTestFixture, the IncomePresentationLayerTestFi=\r\nxture, and the DebtLoadPresentationLayerTestFixture, let=E2=80=99s say via =\r\nan Annotation on ReporterTestFixture. Each presentation layer would be mark=\r\ned to depend upon its logic layer. The logics would depend upon the datas, =\r\nany additional helper classes, and finally the Analysis class. Finally, the=\r\n data layers would be marked to depend upon any =E2=80=9Chelper classes=E2=\r\n=80=9D that they use.\r\n&gt;\r\n&gt; Under this schema, if any of the DebtLoadLogicLayer=E2=80=99s tests were=\r\n to fail, the DebtLoadPresentationLayerTestFixture and the ReporterTestFixt=\r\nure would be skipped, and the DebtLoadLogicLayerTestFixture=E2=80=99s tests=\r\n would be highlighted as since they failed. The ConsumerSpendingLogic and P=\r\nresentaionLayerTestFixtures would be run along with their analogues in Inco=\r\nme as they do not depend upon the DebtLoadLogicLayer and report any errors =\r\nfound as described above. As another example, if any of Consumer=E2=80=99s =\r\ntests fail, then nearly the entire tree would be skipped (all of the n-tier=\r\n code plus the Reporter), thus showing only a failure in Consumer and maybe=\r\n a failure in some other helper classes. In other words, you very quickly f=\r\nind the lowest level class where a failure occurred before it can percolate=\r\n up through your test suite. This would greatly simplify life when running =\r\nregression suites as the class that caused the error (along with its develo=\r\nper, hopefully) is easy identifiable.\r\n&gt;\r\n&gt; The major value-add of this approach is that you get most of the benefit=\r\ns of dependency trees without the hassle of maintaining thousands of depend=\r\nency links. The class relationships above are rarely going to change=E2=80=\r\n=94in other words, if the logic layer stops depending upon the data layer, =\r\nyou=E2=80=99ve probably rearchitected the system and are already being care=\r\nful about what you are doing=E2=80=94and the annotations are very easy to w=\r\nrite. Also, due to the hierarchical nature of the dependencies, you do have=\r\n a bit of a safety net: if a Logic Layer forgets to claim a helper class de=\r\npendency, but that Logic Layer=E2=80=99s Data Layer does claim that depende=\r\nncy, then the Logic Layer=E2=80=99s tests are still skipped when the helper=\r\n class fails.\r\n&gt;\r\n&gt; The biggest shortcoming of this approach involves situations where you h=\r\nave lots of classes that all depend upon one helper class: for example, if =\r\nwe had thirty indices, we would have to maintain thirty annotations for eac=\r\nh helper class on each data layer, thus requiring more maintenance to track=\r\n the dependency. Another negative is that a single failing test in your tes=\r\nt fixture could skip over 95% of your tests since this information is store=\r\nd on a class rather than method level. However, the maintenance costs are m=\r\nuch lower, and the method dependencies could be added later if we are smart=\r\n about our framework.\r\n&gt;\r\n&gt; How does that sound?\r\n&gt;\r\n&gt; Thank you,\r\n&gt;\r\n&gt; Rocco\r\n&gt;\r\n&gt; From: junit@yahoogroups.com&lt;mailto:junit%40yahoogroups.com&gt; [mailto:juni=\r\nt@yahoogroups.com&lt;mailto:junit%40yahoogroups.com&gt;] On Behalf Of Kent Beck\r\n&gt; Sent: Tuesday, January 05, 2010 1:07 PM\r\n&gt; To: junit@yahoogroups.com&lt;mailto:junit%40yahoogroups.com&gt;\r\n&gt; Subject: Re: [junit] Order of execution for tests\r\n&gt;\r\n&gt;\r\n&gt;\r\n&gt; Could you provide a concrete example so I&#39;m sure I understand what you&#39;r=\r\ne saying?\r\n&gt;\r\n&gt; Thanks,\r\n&gt;\r\n&gt; Kent\r\n&gt;\r\n&gt; On Jan 5, 2010, at 8:21 AM, Pigneri, Rocco wrote:\r\n&gt;\r\n&gt; &gt; Dear all,\r\n&gt; &gt;\r\n&gt; &gt; An interesting 80-20 solution for this scenario could be something as =\r\nsimple as an attribute indicating that a test fixture depends upon the pass=\r\ning of all tests in another fixture.
