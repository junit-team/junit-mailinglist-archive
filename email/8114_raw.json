Like testing that the result of an operation is equal to the \nexpected result.\n\nI seem to remember someone submitting a set of assert methods that can be \nused to verify an &quot;equals&quot; implementation.\n\nWhen I&#39;ve implemented equals/hashcode/compareTo I&#39;ve hand coded the tests \n(ok, I do some cut & paste, too).\n\n         Ken\n\nAt 05:10 AM 5/20/2003, you wrote:\n\n&gt;Fine but I really feel equals should behave so.\n&gt;The question is more do you have a need for NON-commutative equals.\n&gt;\n&gt;As the testing of the equality&#39;s implementation is better done by :\n&gt;\n&gt;   [code]\n&gt;      testAequalsBimplementation ()\n&gt;      {\n&gt;        assertTrue (&quot;A is not equal to B&quot;,  a.equals (b));\n&gt;      }\n&gt;      testBequalsAimplementation ()\n&gt;      {\n&gt;        assertTrue (&quot;B is not equal to A&quot;,  b.equals (a));\n&gt;      }\n&gt;   [/code]\n&gt;\n&gt;The REAL / FULL equality is therefore better evaluated by either the\n&gt;combination of both... and that&#39;s precisely what the assertEquals\n&gt;should test IMHO !\n&gt;\n&gt;Equality is really equivalent to test both cases :\n&gt;   [code]\n&gt;      testAequalsB ()\n&gt;      {\n&gt;        assertEquals (&quot;A is not equals to B&quot;, a, b);\n&gt;      }\n&gt;   [/code]\n&gt;\n&gt;but I believe many people don&#39;t have the need to have equals() being\n&gt;implemented too extensively & therefore are pleased with most failure\n&gt;returned to have an acceptable implemetation.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Thomas,\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;--- In junit@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Paul Zabelin&quot; &lt;pavel_zabelin@3...&gt;\n&gt;wrote:\n&gt; &gt; --- In junit@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Thomas  SMETS&quot; &lt;tsmets@l...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I am wondering why the assertEquals is not doing a more thorough\n&gt; &gt; &gt; validation.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; This would make sure that :\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   A = B  &lt;=&gt; B = A\n&gt; &gt; &gt; which is trivial &quot;math&quot; & sounds to me like a normal default\n&gt; &gt; behavior\n&gt; &gt; &gt; (though slower).\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Could it be a candidate for ThoroughDecorator or ThoroughTestCase?\n&gt; &gt; After couple of years of using junit I had never had a need to\n&gt;assert\n&gt; &gt; on commutative equal. If you want to test your own Object&#39;s equals,\n&gt; &gt; then may be you can just create several test\n&gt; &gt; checking &quot;commutativeness&quot;?\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt;junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Your use of Yahoo!
