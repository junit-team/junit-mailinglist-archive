Testing trumps encapsulation<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Agreed.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;    However, if I can cover (as measured with a coverage tool) the<br/>\n&gt;    private methods by calling public methods, I will do that rather than<br/>\n&gt;    test the private methods explicitly.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Doesn&#39;t this implicitly imply that unit testing is optional, since you can<br/>\nachieve the same goal with functional tests?<br/>\n<br/>\nFunctional tests are here for the user&#39;s comfort, unit tests are here for<br/>\nthe programmer&#39;s comfort.  Sure, my coverage can tell me that a certain part<br/>\nof my application is tested indirectly, but if I don&#39;t have unit tests for<br/>\nthem, locating the bug will be harder for me since there will be multiple<br/>\nsuspects for the location of the bug.<br/>\n<br/>\nConsider the following example:  I have to display a sorted list in a web<br/>\npage, and I only have a functional test that verifies that the HTML is<br/>\ncorrect.  My coverage confirms that my ordering logic is run during the<br/>\ntests.  In this situation, the ordering logic is private and not directly<br/>\ntested.<br/>\n<br/>\nA user reports that the list is not sorted correctly, and now I find myself<br/>\nwith at least two possible locations to investigate:  the HTML generation<br/>\nand the sorting logic.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I had written a test for the private sorting logic, I would know right<br/>\naway where the bug is.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nCedric<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://testng.org\">http://testng.org</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",
