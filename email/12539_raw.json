B. Rainsberger&quot; &lt;jbrains@r...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;  &gt; This is entirely untrue. See Scott Stirling&#39;s good work in Chapter 5 of\n&gt;  &gt; _JUnit Recipes_.\n&gt; \n&gt; Sorry, I never intend to malign JUnit, while I think JUnit is a very\n&gt; great framework, I got lots of ideas from JUnit.\n&gt; I had missed the &quot;JUnit Recipes&quot;, I want to read this book but seems I\n&gt; can&#39;t get it in China. Anyway, I&#39;ll change the words about JUnit in\n&gt; Jetif documentation.\n\nThanks. I just don&#39;t want people to have the wrong impression about JUnit.\n\nAs for the book, you can probably only find it on online bookstores for \nnow. Even the bookstore across from my house doesn&#39;t have it yet.\n\n&gt; Yes, Frameworks should be light, but Jetif is not intended to provides\n&gt; every thing. It&#39;s only provides the way to add extension more easier.\n&gt; I prefer that &quot;Keep it simple, while not too simple&quot;.\n\nI understand.\n\n&gt; I had tried to extend the JUnit, but I found that I have to rewrite\n&gt; lots of classes to add desired features. It&#39;s impossible to change the\n&gt; JUnit framework since lots of people used it, so I create a new framework.\n\nInteresting. Do you describe your experience in your documentation? I&#39;d \nlike to read about it.\n\nThanks again, and I&#39;m glad to see contributions to the testing landscape!\n-- \nJ. B.
