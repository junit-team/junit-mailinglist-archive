I measure too little testing<br/>\nby several factors:<br/>\n 1. inability to refactor, redesign, etc.<br/>\n 2. lack of confidence that what I am doing isn&#39;t breaking something<br/>\nwithout my knowing<br/>\n 3. number of unresolved bugs (which I treat as test cases that have yet<br/>\nto be written)<br/>\n 4. level of brittleness in the code (related to #2)<br/>\n 5. etc. (someone else chime in)<br/>\n<br/>\n=jason<br/>\n[:question | ^One] <br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: tumb@...

How, if at all, do you determine what&#39;s too little or too<br/>\nmuch?<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________________________________________<br/>\nSign Up for Juno Platinum Internet Access Today<br/>\nOnly $9.95 per month!<br/>\nVisit www.juno.com<br/>\n<br/>\nYahoo!
