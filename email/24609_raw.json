I&#39;d also like to give my five cents:\n&gt;\n&gt; I was playing around with the new features of Java 8 and when it came to\n&gt; lambdas I started to think about how useful they are when it comes to\n&gt; testing. I always wanted to exercise how it would be to create a testing\n&gt; framework that is tested by itself. So after visiting the XP Days this\n&gt; year, I started to sit down and to play around with it.\n&gt;\n&gt; When I started I made 3 clear assumptions:\n&gt; 1) I don&#39;t want to write any kind of assertions, at least not those that\n&gt; come for free with Hamcrest.\n&gt; 2) I do want to use as much of pure Java as possible, especially as\n&gt; lambdas add a hole level of expressiveness\n&gt; 3) I wanted to place something like a global application context to\n&gt; configure the test system and allow plugins to register themselves for the\n&gt; test run\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; While number 1 was very easy to pick up, I was wondering how to express\n&gt; tests such that they read much nicer, but still by having pure Java code. I\n&gt; came up with the following rules:\n&gt; a) Use Java classes to create test classes\n&gt; b) Use inner Java classes annotated by @Context to create hierarchical\n&gt; contexts (like supported by the hierarchical context runner, see\n&gt; https://github.com/bechte/junit-hierarchicalcontextrunner/wiki)\n&gt; c) Use Java methods annotated by @Test to represent tests\n&gt; d) All types of Tests (groups, hierarchies, methods) implement a single\n&gt; interface, called Testable\n&gt; e) The Testable has methods to get a name, a unique identifier and to run\n&gt; the test returning a TestResult object\n&gt; f) Use a TestableFactory to create the Testable objects by handing in any\n&gt; kind of Object (a class, method, a name, etc.)\n&gt; g) Allow plugins to register themselves with the TestableFactory to allow\n&gt; them to participate in the process of finding a Testable\n&gt; h) This also allows plugins to load any kind of &quot;type&quot; of tests, from any\n&gt; kind of location (could be a Java class, a text-file, or what have you...)\n&gt; i) Use a global application context to load all the configurations which\n&gt; are provided by annotation on the test class and loaded by the framework\n&gt; j) Instead of Rules, use Java8 lambdas to express these kind of concepts\n&gt; (see examples below)\n&gt; k) Use default methods on interfaces to express global/shared concepts\n&gt; among classes / test cases\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; From these points, I would extract the following requirements:\n&gt; - Test names: Within Java, they should conform to the Java Naming\n&gt; Conventions. Outside, it could be anything the according plugin parser can\n&gt; evaluate. :-)\n&gt; - Runners: Runners should not be limited to one per class. Indeed, the\n&gt; TestableFactory would allow to have multiple runners for a test, such that\n&gt; you can have a class that runs its methods as tests and resolves additional\n&gt; tests from a test-file or so. Think of it as possibility to have your setup\n&gt; and teardown in Java methods while the tests cases are specified at another\n&gt; file.\n&gt; - Reporting: Runners should notify Listeners during the test run and\n&gt; return a TestResult to the framework, which should gather all results and\n&gt; report them to Reports at the end of the run. These two concept allow\n&gt; mostly every kind of reporting that might be necessary, I think. We should\n&gt; get rid of these kind of Description thing and there should be no need to\n&gt; create a &quot;tree structure&quot; of the tests and their children right before the\n&gt; start. I think the runners should return their results and it may be\n&gt; combined into a tree like structure in order to represent hierarchies of\n&gt; tests.\n&gt; - Moreover, the TestResult class should be as abstract as possible. When\n&gt; talking about &quot;Jump to Source&quot; we should think of it like an URL. The\n&gt; source of a Testable could be almost everything, like a class, a method, a\n&gt; txt-file or cucumber test, or what have you. Therefore, Jump to Source\n&gt; should point to a unique name, an unique identifier that must be resolved\n&gt; by the IDE, that wants to link back to the code / file / etc. Therefore,\n&gt; use the default naming conventions and schemas, which should reflect almost\n&gt; everything which is needed.\n&gt; - Rules: There is nothing like a Rule needed. Global startup /\n&gt; initialization / teardown can be performed by the hook within the\n&gt; application context, once for a suite / test class / whatever. Rule for\n&gt; handling exceptions, run in parallel, run multiple times, or to test timing\n&gt; behavior can be easily represented by the lambdas mentioned in j). Here are\n&gt; two examples of how this might read (you can find it at\n&gt; https://github.com/bechte/JUT/tree/master/src/main/java/de/bechte/jut/matchers\n&gt; )\n&gt;\n&gt; Example 1: Exception Handling\n&gt; ========================\n&gt;\n&gt; @Test\n&gt; public void someExceptionTest throws Exception {\n&gt;   expectException(MyException.class).withMessage(&quot;Some error\n&gt; message!&quot;).in(() -&gt; {\n&gt;     // here goes your test code without exception handling\n&gt;     service.call(&quot;whatever&quot;);\n&gt;   });\n&gt; }\n&gt;\n&gt; Example 2: Run multiple times (parallel):\n&gt; ===============================\n&gt;\n&gt; @Test\n&gt; public void multipleRunTest throws Exception {\n&gt;   runMultipleTimes(10).inParallel().withTimeout(1,\n&gt; TimeUnit.SECONDS).run(() -&gt; {\n&gt;     // here goes your long running test code\n&gt;     service.call(&quot;whatever&quot;);\n&gt;   });\n&gt; }\n&gt;\n&gt; - Filtering and Sorting: Filtering and Sorting should also be configured\n&gt; during startup / bootstrapping the tests. The filters and sorters should be\n&gt; registered within the application context and should be used by the\n&gt; TestableFactory when searching / resolving the Testable objects. This is\n&gt; the perfect place to perform both, filtering & sorting.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;ve put together all that I have in my little prototype and I really\n&gt; think it is worth to take a closer look at it:\n&gt; https://github.com/bechte/JUT. Please don&#39;t take it the wrong way, this\n&gt; is just my ideas expressed by code, as I think it is much easier to\n&gt; understand some of the parts by looking at the code.\n&gt;\n&gt; I hope some of the ideas make sense and will help to create a great new\n&gt; version for Testing in Java. :-)\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Btw. I really think that Java 8 comes with so many new features and that\n&gt; the programming model has significally changed, such that it would be a\n&gt; great idea to &quot;rethink&quot; the former ideas of what Unit Testing was all about\n&gt; and I wouldn&#39;t be to sad if we start all over and do not support older\n&gt; versions with whatever will be the &quot;new&quot; framework. The changes in the Java\n&gt; language really allow to break downward compatibility when creating\n&gt; something much better, I think.\n&gt;\n&gt; All the best,\n&gt;\n&gt; Stefan\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo Groups Links\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\r\n--001a113a84d89c9be80506206f9b\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=ISO-8859-1\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;div dir=3D&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;I think there&#39;s likely much more to talk about than co=\r\nuld fit in a single thread.&nbsp; Let&#39;s pick up the discussion here:&lt;di=\r\nv&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=3D&quot;https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/testing=\r\n-java-8&quot;&gt;https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/testing-java-8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/di=\r\nv&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Anyone is welcome; within the group, we can start ind=\r\nividual threads on individual subtopics, leaving this main list open for mo=\r\nre incremental discussions about JUnit 4, and community troubleshooting.&lt;/d=\r\niv&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp;David&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=3D&quot;gmail_ex=\r\ntra&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div class=3D&quot;gmail_quote&quot;&gt;On Thu, Oct 23, 2014 at 5:12 PM, Stefan=\r\n Bechtold &lt;a href=3D&quot;mailto:stefan.bechtold@...&quot;&gt;stefan.bechtold@...&lt;=\r\n/a&gt; [junit] &lt;span dir=3D&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;&lt;a href=3D&quot;mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com&quot; =\r\ntarget=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;junit@yahoogroups.com&lt;/a&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt; wrote:&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquot=\r\ne class=3D&quot;gmail_quote&quot; style=3D&quot;margin:0 0 0 .8ex;border-left:1px #ccc sol=\r\nid;padding-left:1ex&quot;&gt;There are a lot of opinions, and great ideas for a new=\r\n flexible testing framework going on here.
