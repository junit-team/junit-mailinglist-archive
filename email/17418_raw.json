Even if I&#39;m convinced though that it is not the best way to\nproduce code I still think that you can produce code that you are\nhappy with even if you retrofit the tests.\nOn the other hand, after using TDD and looking back on how it changed\nthe way of thinking and how much it aided/simplified my thought\nprocess I don&#39;t see how I would /want/ to do that. I&#39;m having much\nmore fun now, writing much better code than I used to do and I think I\ndo it with less effort.\n\n\n&gt;  These types of test add no value as they are difficult to maintain.\n\nI think that you would miss out on the value of the tests /driving/\nthe design wich I think is a lot. I don&#39;t think that they have /no/\nvalue.\n\n&gt;  Writing the test would only slow development under\n&gt;  these scenarios unless I&#39;m missing something obvious.\nI would agree to that to some degree, if you miss out on the driving\npart of your tests them the argument that it takes more time because\nyou have to write twice as much code is  a lot more valid. (You miss\nout on the thoughtprocess and the design that &quot;falls out of your\ntests&quot;).\n\nI agree with a lot you wrote since I read it the way I wanted to read\nit. Someone else that wanted to read it differently would perhaps\nloose some of the good points you make since it seems a bit &quot;binary&quot;?\n\nI don&#39;t know, just my two cents for what they might be worth...\n\n",
