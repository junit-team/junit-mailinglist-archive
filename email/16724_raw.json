Could you please put i=\r\nn big, red letters on the \nsite \n&gt; that this is strictly a legacy code tech=\r\nnique, and that people \nshould \n&gt; try to refactor away from using the tool =\r\nas quickly as possible?\n&gt; \n&gt; Another great tool for adding tests to code. I=\r\n think I can use this \n&gt; tomorrow.\n&gt; -- \nI just read the post on this littl=\r\ne tool, so I haven&#39;t tried it yet, \nbut it seems like it would be very help=\r\nful for mocking member objects \ncreated in a class. How do you refactor to =\r\neliminate a dependency on \nmember objects. I understand how to do it with o=\r\nbjects a class \ncollaborates with, but it is a different matter when the me=\r\nmber \nobjects are &quot;owned&quot; by the object being tested. I guess you could \npr=\r\novide the class with a factory class it could use to create it&#39;s \nmembers, =\r\nbut this seems like a lot of overhead for an object that only \nneeds this c=\r\napability for testing purposes.\n\nI am a new java programmer, so forgive me =\r\nif my terminology isn&#39;t \ncorrect. Hopefully you can understand what I am tr=\r\nying to say.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
