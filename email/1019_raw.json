My question is one of usage in the development cycle - \nhow are people using the ant/junit combination in actual development, \nparticularly in a test first, XP -style of development where you tend to \nwork in a single package while making changes or adding new functionality \nand as a consequence want to run the tests for that package (or more often \na single TestCase) after the build. Are you adding a junit task to the \nbuild file for each TestCase (which could easily get out of hand), or \nperhaps for each package (and wearing the slower test time) or do you not \neven use ant/junit at this level, instead keeping a junit (ui or cli) \nwindow open and run the tests from there after a successful build ?\n\nTIA\n\nRobert\n\n\n",
