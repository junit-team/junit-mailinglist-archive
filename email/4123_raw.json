I have\n&gt; &gt; reported the bug to SUN, but they directed here, since this\n&gt; behaviour does\n&gt; &gt; not occur in a simple standalone class.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Attached is the unit test that I ran, as well as the output.  Note\n&gt; &gt; especially the third line:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;     Class Byte:  Success means that 128 &gt; 127\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; What I have found is that when a byte variable is defined as a class\n&gt; &gt; variable within a unit test and then incremented, it is possible to\n&gt; &gt; increment it out of the range of bytes specified by the language\n&gt; &gt; specification in two aspects:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; 1 - Converting the byte to a string results in the string &quot;128&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; 2 - Comparation states that the byte is larger than Byte.MAX_VALUE\n&gt; &gt;     ( (classByte &gt; Byte.MAX_VALUE) is true )\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; As the log shows, this test passes in my setup, and I have tried it on\n&gt; &gt; several computers.  Could someone in the know run this test and\n&gt; see if you\n&gt; &gt; can figure out what is going on, because I am totally lost in this.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Thanks and regards,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Magnus Torfason\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Here are my results (JDK 1.3.1)\n&gt;\n&gt; .    Local Byte:  Success means that -128 == -128\n&gt; .    Static Byte: Success means that -128 == -128\n&gt; .    Class Byte:  Success means that -128 &gt; 127\n&gt; F.    Class Short: Success means that -32768 &gt; 32767\n&gt; F\n&gt; Time: 0.081\n&gt; There were 2 failures:\n&gt; 1) testByteMaxValue(StrangeByteTest)junit.framework.AssertionFailedError\n&gt;          at StrangeByteTest.testByteMaxValue(StrangeByteTest.java:51)\n&gt; 2) testShortMaxValue(StrangeByteTest)junit.framework.AssertionFailedError\n&gt;          at StrangeByteTest.testShortMaxValue(StrangeByteTest.java:62)\n&gt; FAILURES!!!\n&gt; Tests run: 4,  Failures: 2,  Errors: 0\n&gt;\n&gt; Question:\n&gt;\n&gt; What JDK are you running?
