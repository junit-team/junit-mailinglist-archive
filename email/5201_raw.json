If they don&#39;t,\nyou replace them.  Unfortunately, this isn&#39;t always\nthe case (at least where I&#39;ve been) so I&#39;ve had to\ndevelop some defensive coding technique.\n\nAlso, from your remark about having to change code\nbecause of the checked versus unchecked exceptions, it\nsounded like you were merely moaning about some part\nof your body hurting.  I, for one, don&#39;t mind having\nto go through and change a bunch of code because of\nsome refactoring I&#39;m doing.  I can, however, see how\nthat&#39;s a bit of a PITA, and so you can avoid that by\nusing the unchecked exceptions.\n\nReally, on the whole, I would tend to agree with you. \nI mainly wanted to get that viewpoint out there to get\nthe discussion a little broader, just in case anyone\nwas thinking that the unchecked exceptions were the\nend all, be all of coding (in Java anyway).\n\nFear (of my crappy code and/or design) makes me write\ntests.\n\nFear (of my coworkers or even sometimes of myself)\nmakes me tend to use checked versus unchecked\nexceptions.\n\nMindkiller?  Sure...but as long as the fear is\ncontrolled, and you use the response productively, it\ncan be a good thing. ;)\n\n-Eric\n\nP.S. Ah, something else I just thought of after\nre-reading.  We are also using exceptions for flow\ncontrol on occasion (for the web-based app we&#39;re\nconverting from VB).  In those instances, the\nexception is thrown and we absolutely must notify the\nuser and/or do something about it to recover.\n\n\n--- &quot;J. B. Rainsberger&quot; &lt;jbr@...&gt;\nwrote:\n&gt; &gt; Hmmm...just to jump in the middle for a\n&gt; &gt; second...personally, I dislike unchecked\n&gt; exceptions. \n&gt; &gt; I used to like them, because, similar to your\n&gt; &gt; experience, you could ignore them and not have the\n&gt; &gt; ripple effect when refactoring.  However, I&#39;ve\n&gt; seen\n&gt; &gt; this as an excuse to completely ignore the\n&gt; exception,\n&gt; &gt; in both testing and production.  Don&#39;t like that\n&gt; at\n&gt; &gt; all.\n&gt; \n&gt; I agree, but at some point, you have to trust the\n&gt; people doing the work to do \n&gt; the work. If they ignore exceptions both in tests\n&gt; and in production, then \n&gt; perhaps you need to replace them. :)\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; So, I&#39;ve decided to knuckle down and NOT use\n&gt; &gt; unchecked exceptions whenever possible.  This\n&gt; *forces*\n&gt; &gt; you to handle them.  \n&gt; \n&gt; I don&#39;t like the patterns that checked exceptions\n&gt; compel me to use: converted \n&gt; exception, and so on... it all sounds like jumping\n&gt; through hoops just to \n&gt; satisfy the compiler. My job is to make tests run,\n&gt; dammit, not to make the \n&gt; compiler happy!\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; That fact that you say using them allows the\n&gt; compiler\n&gt; &gt; to &#39;get in the way&#39; sounds like a non-issue.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;sounds like&quot;? With respect, do you *know* that it\n&gt; is a nonissue? (If so, how \n&gt; do I make it go away?!) For me, it *is* an issue;\n&gt; otherwise, I wouldn&#39;t feel \n&gt; so strongly. \n&gt; \n&gt; I want to let exceptions propagate as much as\n&gt; possible, because exceptions \n&gt; represent situations where my code has to throw up\n&gt; its hands and say, &quot;Man, I \n&gt; can&#39;t go any further.&quot; In most cases, that&#39;s\n&gt; unrecoverable within the layer \n&gt; and I want to propagate the exception up to the\n&gt; caller. In that case, checked \n&gt; exceptions couple the caller to callee unnecessarily\n&gt; at compile time. \n&gt; \n&gt; Yes, the caller needs to be aware of and handle the\n&gt; exception; however, I&#39;m \n&gt; not convinced that the compiler is the only way to\n&gt; achieve that. We&#39;ve \n&gt; managed quite nicely without the compiler&#39;s help and\n&gt; I&#39;m happy with the \n&gt; results. Again: that&#39;s what tests are for and that&#39;s\n&gt; why code is written by \n&gt; humans and not automatically generated.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Is this\n&gt; &gt; coupling between your two systems?  Maybe...but I\n&gt; &gt; (personally) would rather have it and make damn\n&gt; sure\n&gt; &gt; those exceptions are handled.\n&gt; \n&gt; What fear are you addressing by using checked\n&gt; exceptions? Since it is \n&gt; possible to get along without them, you may be\n&gt; afraid of something in order \n&gt; to want to use them. What might that be?
