When I<br/>\nrun the unit test inside Eclipse the file is found and the tests run<br/>\nfine.  I even tried removing the jar from Eclipse&#39;s build path to make<br/>\nsure it was not finding the file in some other location.  The test<br/>\nfailed without the jar in the path, so I am pretty sure the unit test<br/>\nis finding the file in the jar.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, when I run the unit tests from ANT I get a NullPointerException<br/>\nbecause the InputStream is Null.  I double checked the classpath that<br/>\nis printed out when the unit test runs and the jar file that contains<br/>\nthe xml file is on the classpath.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere is the code I am using to read in the xml file.  It is pretty<br/>\nmuch the same as the original poster.<br/>\n<br/>\n// Get our sample input file.<br/>\nInputStream is = Class.class.getResourceAsStream(&quot;/RunPOEngineTest.xml&quot;);<br/>\nInputStreamReader sr = new InputStreamReader(is);<br/>\n<br/>\nAny insight would be appreciated.  Is there some known differences<br/>\nwith running Unit test in Eclipse vs. ANT that could be tripping me up.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\n<br/>\nCraig<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a>, Chad Woolley &lt;lists@t...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; Hello,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I am writing a test related to XML parsing.

Hopefully someone can help, or refer me to some<br/>\nhelpful <br/>\n&gt; documentation.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Thanks,<br/>\n&gt; Chad </span></blockquote></div>",
