But praying \ndoesn&#39;t work :-)  If it&#39;s using a debugger, so be it.\n\nThe problem with a debugger is that after a debugging session, all the \ninformation you grabbed is... in your head.  And not in your tests.\n\nIf you are using a debugger and after you have found the problem, try to \nwrite a test to reproduce the bug and fix the problem.  After this, you \nwill have at least several additional tests.\n\n-Vladimir\n\n-- \nVladimir R. Bossicard\nwww.bossicard.com\n\n\n",
