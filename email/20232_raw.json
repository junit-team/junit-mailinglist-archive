The test\nneeds to express how the object calls out through the interface, not\nhow the object and one specific implementation  work.\n\nI also often introduce mock objects if the collaborator is\ncomplicated, so the test of the object and its collaborator would have\nto cover a large number of combinations.\n\nI especially don&#39;t mock value objects.  I have tests for the value\ntypes, and then just use the value types in tests.\n\n&gt;  2)\n&gt;  Is there any strategy/method in what order you can test classes for an\n&gt;  existing project?\n\nDo you mean the order in which you write the tests, or in which the\ntests are run?\n\nI write a test just before I write the code to make it pass.\n\nI don&#39;t assume that they run in any particular order, and so ensure\nthey are completely independent from one another.\n\n--Nat\n\n",
