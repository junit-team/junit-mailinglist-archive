Concordion makes a different set of design choices=\r\n to try and\nmake it easier to write specifications and harder to write scri=\r\npts.\n\nThere are big advantages to writing specifications rather than\nscript=\r\ns:\n\n- Longer lives. When you move to the next technology, you can reuse\n  t=\r\nhe specifications since they are implementation-independent.\n\n- Agility. Se=\r\nparating examples of required behaviour from the \n  mechanics of testing al=\r\nlows you to refactor the mechanics\n  (i.e. the implementation of your syste=\r\nm) without affecting the\n  test cases.\n\nTake a look at this page for an exa=\r\nmple of a FitNesse script compared\nto a Concordion specification:\n\nhttp://w=\r\nww.concordion.org/ScriptingMakeover.html\n\nDavid\n\n\n--- In junit@yahoogroups.=\r\ncom, Ilja Preuss &lt;it@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Did you take a look at Fit/FitNesse?\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; Your Concordian seems to go in a very similar direction...\n&gt; \n&gt; Cheers,=\r\n Ilja\n&gt;\n\n\n\n",
