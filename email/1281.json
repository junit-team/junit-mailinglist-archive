I probably want to encapsulate<br/>\n&gt; that algorithm<br/>\n&gt; into its own method so, e.g., I can Substitute in a new<br/>\n&gt; Algorithm later when<br/>\n&gt; someone points out that I (again) made the problem a lot<br/>\n&gt; harder than it needed<br/>\n&gt; to be.  I may well want to make that method private, though,<br/>\n&gt; as its existence<br/>\n&gt; or signature could reveal more about the internals of my<br/>\n&gt; class than I&#39;d like;<br/>\n&gt; it might, e.g., have an argument that refers to a component<br/>\n&gt; of some (private) field.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You could put the algorithm in its own class. So you could test it through<br/>\nthe public interface of the algorithm class without breaking encapsulation<br/>\nof the client class. Additionally you could easily use an other algorithm by<br/>\njust pluging in an alternative implementation (without having to rewrite the<br/>\nclient class).<br/>\n<br/>\nciao, Ilja</div>",
