Rainsberger [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jbrains@...\">jbrains@...</a>] <br/>\n&gt; That&#39;s an interesting approach. It&#39;s slightly different from <br/>\n&gt; what I would do.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Interesting in a good way?  :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; Why a MockService? Is the service not the thing you&#39;re <br/>\n&gt; testing? <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>The reason I created a MockService class is because I wanted to test the<br/>\ncode in the abstract class and to get an instance of the abstract class<br/>\nI need a concrete class.  Is a mock object the correct terminology in<br/>\nthis case?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I always get nervous when I have to mock the thing <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m testing. Since you&#39;re testing the event source, I would <br/>\n&gt; recommend rewriting this test so that the event source you <br/>\n&gt; test is an actual event source, and not some subclass <br/>\n&gt; (however trivial) of it.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>The original intent of my test was to verify that an event is fired when<br/>\ncertain methods in the abstract class are called and that the event<br/>\nobject contained the correct data.  Would that be considered testing the<br/>\nevent source?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; For example: factor out the event source from the abstract <br/>\n&gt; class, then test the event source on its own.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I like this idea.  I&#39;ll have to take a look at the design to see how I<br/>\ncan work it in.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for your help!<br/>\n<br/>\nKris</div>",
