You have obviously employed independent unit<br/>\ntesters after this expected point of convergence, which has helped make<br/>\nthis work for you. I&#39;m not sure about generalizing, though. That&#39;s just<br/>\na matter of opinion -- for each of us.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome interfaces stabilize, others do not. The ones that tends to<br/>\nstabilize are the ones at the boundaries between subsystems or<br/>\ncomponents. Internal interfaces may change daily. At the least,<br/>\nvirtually every new feature changes an interface somewhere.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; So explain to me the difference between what you describe and Pair<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Programming combined with TDD. Is it just that other programmers<br/>\n </span></blockquote>are,<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; on their own, writing tests for my stuff after I&#39;ve written it?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;There can be. As with all things, team structure, process and<br/>\n </span></blockquote>methodology<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;can be tweaked to suit the team and the project. As you stated, TDD is<br/>\n </span></blockquote>not<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;primarily meant to find bugs, whereas independent unit testing is very<br/>\n </span></blockquote>good<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;at that, and generally that is its primary purpose; early testing. If<br/>\n </span></blockquote>you<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;have an XP team that is so good that they write perfect code, and a<br/>\n </span></blockquote>*good*<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;independent unit tester can&#39;t find any bugs in the code, then don&#39;t<br/>\n </span></blockquote>use<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;independent unit testers and more power to you. But I have yet to see<br/>\n </span></blockquote>such<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;a<br/>\n&gt;team or such developers - and I feel fairly confident that I could<br/>\n </span></blockquote>write<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;unit tests that would find significant bugs in just about any new<br/>\n </span></blockquote>codebase<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;under development - including a codebase developed using TDD.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t like the idea that they are writing tests on their own. My fear<br/>\nis that they will make different assumptions about the code&#39;s intended<br/>\nbehavior.<br/>\n<br/>\nBy the way, I stated that TDD is not meant to find bugs, period. Delete<br/>\n&quot;primarily&quot;. I conjecture that the reason that many people fight with<br/>\nProgrammer Tests is that they want PTs to find bugs, when that is not<br/>\ntheir purpose at all. Again, that is my opinion, but I think it&#39;s<br/>\nright.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nJ. B.
