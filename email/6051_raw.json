Typically with data driven testing you\n&gt; have one test method (or possibly a small set of methods) and each\n&gt; method runs many tests. The Junit TestCase class uses the method name\n&gt; as the test name and I would really like to have a unique name for\n&gt; each test (which is easy to provide in the test data.) Has anyone any\n&gt; ideas on how to address this issue?\n\nYes.\n\nOh, you want to know what they are? :)\n\nYou need to change the name of the test to match that provided in the\ntest data. There are three ways to do this:\n1) Pass the name in via the constructor. This works well, because you\nare passing in lots of other stuff (the test data).\n2) Use the setName() method of JUnit 3.8\n3) Override the getName() method (just name() in earlier versions).\n\nHowever, all of these techniques have a common problem: they cause the\ndefault implementation of TestCase.run() to break. This is because\nTestCase.run() uses the name to look up the test method via reflection.\nSo, if you&#39;ve changed the name, you need to change the TestCase.run()\nmethod as well.\n\nA quick read of the code for TestCase, and (to a lesser degree)\nTestSuite, will help you out here.\n\nRobert.\n\n-- \n               &quot;Software is too expensive to build cheaply&quot;\n  Robert Watkins                          email: robertdw@...\n\n\n",
