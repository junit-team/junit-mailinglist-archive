Typically with data driven testing you\n&gt; &gt; have one test method (or possibly a small set of methods) and each\n&gt; &gt; method runs many tests. The Junit TestCase class uses the method name\n&gt; &gt; as the test name and I would really like to have a unique name for\n&gt; &gt; each test (which is easy to provide in the test data.) Has anyone any\n&gt; &gt; ideas on how to address this issue?\n&gt;\n&gt; Yes.\n&gt;\n&gt; Oh, you want to know what they are? :)\n&gt;\n&gt; You need to change the name of the test to match that provided in the\n&gt; test data. There are three ways to do this:\n&gt; 1) Pass the name in via the constructor. This works well, because you\n&gt; are passing in lots of other stuff (the test data).\n&gt; 2) Use the setName() method of JUnit 3.8\n&gt; 3) Override the getName() method (just name() in earlier versions).\n&gt;\n&gt; However, all of these techniques have a common problem: they cause the\n&gt; default implementation of TestCase.run() to break. This is because\n&gt; TestCase.run() uses the name to look up the test method via reflection.\n&gt; So, if you&#39;ve changed the name, you need to change the TestCase.run()\n&gt; method as well.\n\nBeen there - tried that ;-)\n\nThat was exactly the problem I encountered when I tried manipulating the\nname. The problem is that these test cases need to run on a variety of IDEs\neach with their own implementation of TestRunner. I have found that the\nEclipse implementation will tolerate name changes but JBuilder does not seem\nto.\n&gt;\n&gt; A quick read of the code for TestCase, and (to a lesser degree)\n&gt; TestSuite, will help you out here.\n&gt;\n&gt; Robert.\n&gt;\n&gt; --\n&gt;                &quot;Software is too expensive to build cheaply&quot;\n&gt;   Robert Watkins                          email: robertdw@...\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
