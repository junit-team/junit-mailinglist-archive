IllegalArgExc) ]<br/>\n&gt;&gt; You are correct, but I actually meant that at runtime,<br/>\n&gt;&gt; my code does not know why your code threw an NPE.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Jumping in here on a point I haven&#39;t really understood in all this<br/>\n&gt;discussion:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I can see that it is at least somewhat useful for the human<br/>\n&gt;troubleshooter reading the stack trace to be able to see quickly<br/>\n&gt;that the problem is an invalid argument, and not a surprising null<br/>\n&gt;somewhere in the guts of the method; this may well speed up the<br/>\n&gt;troubleshooting, and makes an argument for throwing IllegalArgExc<br/>\n&gt;as a matter of style.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;But why would the calling code care?  For example, why would it<br/>\n&gt;react differently to an IllegalArgExc than to any random<br/>\n&gt;RuntimeException?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Good question. I hope that I can provide a good answer. The reason why my code would care about the type of exception raised by the code that I have called is that there are some exceptions that are non-terminal and that when received, my code will try to do something about it. Let&#39;s try an example:<br/>\n<br/>\nAn IllegalArgumentException means that I have messed up.<br/>\n<br/>\nA JDBC Connection exception might mean that the database is down, and that if my code is patient and retries in a few seconds, then everything may be connected again. (This is not unusual ... I have found allowing for a number of retries to be a good thing when working with both database connections and also messaging systems)<br/>\n<br/>\nA NullPointerException means nothing to anybody&#39;s code. Did I pass a Null value, or did the code that I called mess up or did it call some other code and that messed up? Who knows!?<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd this is why my code cares about the exception that comes back. I can make programatic decisions based upon the exception that is returned, if the exception that is returned is meaningfull.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope this helps.<br/>\n<br/>\nSimon<br/>\n<br/>\n-----------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nSimon P.
