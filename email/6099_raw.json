It would only take\na few minutes, \n&gt;versus waiting for hours or days for someone to give\nyou a response \n&gt;here.\n\nI would imagine he&#39;s thinking ahead to when he has\nmany, many tests.  Even then, if/when one fails, it\nwon&#39;t initially be clear if it failed because of a\nreal bug, or because the tests are stepping on each\nother.  And even when you figure that out, it will not\nbe clear what the right approach is to fixing the\nproblem with the test.\n\nI&#39;ve had an issue where tests were stepping on each\nother, but we were apparently using a multithreaded\nrunner.  I used synchronized blocks to fix it up, but\nI was constantly having to find and synchronize stuff,\nso I&#39;d consider that a cheap hack at best.\n\nKevin\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nNew DSL Internet Access from SBC & Yahoo!\nhttp://sbc.yahoo.com\n\n\n",
