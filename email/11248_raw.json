What Agitator can do for you is\n&gt; generate test data that gets you code coverage and then shows you\n&gt; what it observed in the form of class and method invariants.  These\n&gt; observations are in the form of Java boolean valued assertions.  For\n&gt; example:\n&gt;      \n&gt;       File.canWrite() == true\n&gt; \n&gt; Or\n&gt;       File.getPath().equals(&quot;C:&#92;foo&#92;bar&quot;)\n&gt; \n&gt; Or\n&gt;       File.list().length == 14\n\nSo does Agitator only report invariants it uncovers, or does it also \ngenerate tabular data representing the output it received for each input?\n\nIt sounds like Agitator does this:\n\n  * try a bunch of inputs\n  * notice patterns in the outputs/state of the code\n  * say to the programmer, &quot;It looks like XYZ is invariant. Would this \nbe a useful assertion?&quot;\n\nMy original response was &quot;Great tool for testing legacy code, useless \nfor TDD,&quot; but this makes me think otherwise:\n\n&lt;snip /&gt;\n &gt; Combined with Agitator&#39;s ability to automatically generate very\n &gt; relevant test data and achieve very high code coverage automatically\n &gt; (through data flow analysis and other dynamic techniques), automated\n &gt; observations are a powerful and very efficient way to create unit\n &gt; tests quickly to get the developer to consider inputs and conditions\n &gt; that they might have missed.  But the developer input is still\n &gt; required to decide if what Agitator observed is what the code is\n &gt; suppsed to do.\n\nThis looks like another method of receiving feedback on the quality of \nthe tests one chooses to write, even when doing TDD.\n\n&gt; I&#39;ll stop here because I don&#39;t want to use this forum to promote\n&gt; Agitator, but I wanted to clear any misconceptions and answer J.B.&#39;s\n&gt; questions.\n\nNo, no, this is quite good. It sounds interesting, and is certainly \nworth examining. It makes me wish I had a project to which to point it \nand try it out.\n-- \nJ. B.
