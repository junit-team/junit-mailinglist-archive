Sometimes the effort is not  <br/>\nworth the payback, but you have to at least consider what it would  <br/>\ntake.  Simply saying &quot;I can&#39;t test it&quot; without exploring how it could  <br/>\nbe tested is a cop-out.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe first barrier is usually ignorance.  I don&#39;t know how or what I  <br/>\nwould test.<br/>\nThe second, is environment and tool support.  This isn&#39;t an issue  <br/>\nwith Java.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome things may be hard to test, some may just require some kinds of  <br/>\nthinking you haven&#39;t done before.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor instance, I have a component that paints on top of another.  I&#39;m  <br/>\nnot going to test the exact image produced by a complex combination  <br/>\nof transparencies, but I can get mileage out of filling the decorator  <br/>\na solid color and ensuring the corners of the bounds of the decorator  <br/>\nshow up the right color.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve implemented a host of custom UI components, whose response to  <br/>\nuser input can be tested with native OS events, stuffing the java  <br/>\nevent queue, or pushing them programmatically.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are links to several JUnit-based UI testing tools at junit.org  <br/>\nand <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/groups/java-gui-testing\">http://groups.yahoo.com/groups/java-gui-testing</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Aug 16, 2006, at 1:06 PM, Altman, Joel G.
