Rainsberg) could add to your article<br/>\n<br/>\nI have been thinking for a while if there could be any other way to solve the singleton &quot;testing problem&quot; and the only solution I came across is to implement a testing framework where class loading is user-tailored:<br/>\n- in the source code there would not be any need to change the singleton code<br/>\n- the tester class would need to setup the framework so that the classloader would load a mock class instead of the singleton class<br/>\n<br/>\nhow does all this sound?<br/>\n<br/>\nregards,<br/>\n--Carlos Manzanares--<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: ext J.
