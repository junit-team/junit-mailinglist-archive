I\n&gt; think most software is living up to our expectations of how it should\n&gt; work but I have certainly been on projects where nothing has been\n&gt; tested automatically and that had a level that we thought were\n&gt; acceptable that I now think is embarrasing. Everything is relative.\n&gt;   \n\nActually, I would go farther out there.  There&#39;s three kinds of software \nout there:\n\n1) Software good enough that some company finally decides to shrink-wrap \nit and ship it to millions, or put it up on their public website and \nwait to get bought by Yahoo!\n2) Software just good enough for the single customer that paid for it to \npay off the contract.\n3) Software that never sees the light of day. (try googling for &quot;* of \nsoftware projects fail&quot;)\n\nWhile a majority of the software many of us _use_ is in category 1, I \nthink that a lot of us work in category 2, and I&#39;ll guess that more than \na few of us have had to escape from a category 3 project at some time. \n\nLet me throw on another anecdote, just for fun.  My wife is a medical \nstudent, and has recently been considering places to do her clinical \nresidency.  One place was still using drug orders written on pieces of \npaper (finally, in 2006, this is unusual even in medicine).  However, \nshe was told: 1) They&#39;re rolling out a new computer system next year, 2) \nOf course, it will probably take about six months to shake out all the \nbugs, but after that, it will be really nice.\n\nI was floored that: 1) My wife and her informant both took it for \ngranted that the software would release with significant bugs, 2) My own \nfirst reaction was actually &quot;Yeah, what can you do.&quot; (indignation came \nlater), 3) We&#39;re talking about _prescribing drugs to hospital patients_ \nhere.\n\nHowever, perhaps none of this is the point.  In the end, it doesn&#39;t \nmatter if the global software industry is producing software that meets \nsome criteria of &quot;good enough&quot;.  What matters to most of our paychecks \nis that our software is better than what our customers could get more \ncheaply from someone else.  I submit that disciplined unit testing has \nenough success stories that it&#39;s worth trying it to see if it makes \nthings better.\n\n    David Saff\n\n",
