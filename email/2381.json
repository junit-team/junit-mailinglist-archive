    "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1096380362\">Thanks everyone.<br/>\n<br/>\nThese are perfectly fine solutions. The only trouble for me was that I wanted<br/>\nthe suite to have an opportunity to track its test case runs and recover,<br/>\nautomatically. I may have a suite consisting of up to 20 or so test cases<br/>\nand may be wrapped in a test harness class to run all suites.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also toy with the tracking of threads for these runs and ended up with the<br/>\nfollowing solution (not quite content with it yet but works):<br/>\n<br/>\n1) Created a synchronized test manager class<br/>\n     and have it read a timeLimit property from a prop file (just for <br/>\nconvenience)<br/>\n2) It spawns a thread for a Runnable class to handle TestRunner.run(suite)<br/>\n     then starts the count down<br/>\n3) When the run() finishes, I flag a testComplete=true flag and notify() the<br/>\n     manager class that the test run is done<br/>\n4) Back in the manager class, if the time elapsed and not testComplete then<br/>\n     I assume a test run fault. Kill the thread and throw exception <br/>\n(ThreadDeath<br/>\n     error is also thrown from this class).<br/>\n     Otherwise, a wait(timeLimit) gets the notification and testComplete=true<br/>\n     implies the test completed successfully.<br/>\n<br/>\nSince I use the Thread.stop()-deprecated to kill the spawning thread, I am not<br/>\ncontent of this solution, at the very least.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe quest continues..<br/>\n<br/>\nAgain, thanks for your advices.<br/>\nThach Nguyen<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 08:28 AM 8/15/2001 -0400, you wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;Sorry everyone.  I attached the tail.exe to the previous post and that<br/>\n&gt;caused some folks&#39; email and virus clients to skip a beat.  If anyone is<br/>\n&gt;interested in the tail program (freeware) let me know and I will put it in<br/>\n&gt;the files section of the group.  For those who don&#39;t know what tail is...<br/>\n&gt;This is a windows port of the standard UNIX tail that allows you to monitor<br/>\n&gt;the end of a file as it is being written.  It is useful for log files or<br/>\n&gt;debug files.

You could also use the<br/>\n&gt;     &gt; -Xrunhprof option (I think<br/>\n&gt;     &gt; it is only available 1.2.x +).
