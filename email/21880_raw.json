Just wanted to know if there are any\n&gt; certifications/training available for JUnit - Open Source unit testing tool\n&gt; . These certifications/training details are required as per business\n&gt; requirements. We would like to get few of our associated certified. Please\n&gt; let us know if you have any learning partner or JUnit itself could provide\n&gt; us the training/certifications.\n&gt;\n&gt; Request you provide the appropriate contact list if I have posted the query\n&gt; on the wrong mailing list.\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks and Regards,\n&gt; Purvi Verma\n&gt;\n&gt; =====-----=====-----=====\n&gt; Notice: The information contained in this e-mail\n&gt; message and/or attachments to it may contain\n&gt; confidential or privileged information.
