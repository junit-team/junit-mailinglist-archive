If your <br/>\nclient has to work with their server, then your client /has/ to respect <br/>\nthe server&#39;s protocol, even if it doesn&#39;t make sense. Use method/class <br/>\nnames or comments liberally and have some kind of automated notification <br/>\nmechanism /somewhere/ (a calendar tool or something?) to remind you that <br/>\na future release of the server /might/ fix the problem.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you make the client match the (bad) server behavior, but keep <br/>\ndocumentation to that effect, then later, when they fix the server, your <br/>\ntest will fail and you&#39;ll know that fixing the server caused the <br/>\nfailure. At that point, fix the client.<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJ. B.
