I don&#39;t think \nthat&#39;s always needed. Anyway, when it&#39;s needed, it&#39;s still an elaborate \nfrom of JCO, as far as I can tell.\n\n&gt; This approach also strongly couples the main() method with the\n&gt; implementation of the singleton you want to pass around, which is very\n&gt; bad.\n\nUse your imagination. You can easily adapt the pattern so that it \ndoesn&#39;t. I&#39;d guess that most DI containers evolved that way.\n\n&gt; A framework like Guice gives you the power to solve all these problems\n&gt; while giving you a lot of control on the lifecycle of your objects and\n&gt; flexibility in your design.  It&#39;s odd that Rob doesn&#39;t even mention it\n&gt; in this article.\n\nI&#39;m not Uncle Bob, but I&#39;d guess that his goal with the article was to \nshow a simple alternative to the Singleton pattern, not to explore the \nwhole solution space for the problem.\n\nCheers, Ilja\n\n",
