So please explain: What tests do you need to <br/>\n&gt; sufficiently test <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; every possible implementation of this interface? How did you find <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; them?<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; You test for the contracts.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; [example of testing for the contract snipped]<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; So you are saying you don&#39;t really care wether your tests are <br/>\n&gt; sufficient but let the users find out which tests are missing?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I think I must still be misunderstanding you...<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Before I make a final release, my code is tested by other developers.<br/>\nThose developers help me find the missing areas.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut keep in mind, if we have written a test for every conceivable<br/>\nmethod we can come up with--someone, somewhere will have a situation<br/>\nwhere something fails to behave as expected.  Any time we have something<br/>\nthat does not behave as expected we have a failure or bug.  Not behaving<br/>\nas expected can be that it takes longer to process than expected, the<br/>\nlog entry doesn&#39;t have the information expected, or something more<br/>\nserious.<br/>\n<br/>\nI apply agile tactics to my testcases.  That means I write what I need<br/>\nwhen I need it.  Just like we can get stuck in anlysis paralysis, we can<br/>\nalso get stuck in testing paralysis.  I start out by testing what I need<br/>\nto enforce.  If there is something that can obviously be a sticking<br/>\npoint,<br/>\nI will write a test for that.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, what I am referring to with regression testing is that you<br/>\nmiss things.  You find that something needs to be tested that you were<br/>\nnot aware needed to be tested.  At that point, you write the testcase<br/>\nthat reproduces the error *before* you fix it.</div>",
