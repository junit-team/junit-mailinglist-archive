Clover is our dream state, but it is more expensive than our management is willing to pay right now.  :)<br/>\n<br/>\n-------------- Original message -------------- <br/>\nDiane,<br/>\n<br/>\nYou may want to use XSL and XSLT... Print out your Junit reports into<br/>\nand XML format (&lt;format /&gt;) and then use a standalone Java program or<br/>\nany other tool to transform the XML into excel sheets. I know that it<br/>\nis not too tough to make comma seperated .csv files from XML/XSL. I am<br/>\nnot too sure what will it take to create the binary .xls files.<br/>\n<br/>\nas far as &quot;velocity&quot; factor you mentioned, take a look at section<br/>\n4.3.2 of the book JUnit in Action. That refers to a tool called Clover<br/>\n- never used it  - but sounds like what you are looking for.<br/>\n<br/>\nhope this helps.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOn Wed, 12 Jan 2005 15:16:09 +0000, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:didoss@...\">didoss@...</a><br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:didoss@...\">didoss@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Paul -<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Thanks for the reply.  Unfortunately, we are already doing that.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; We run a nightlybuild with tests.  It copies the previous results to a<br/>\n&gt; backup-reports directory, cleans the reports directory, and then creates the<br/>\n&gt; current results html files.  Then, we send out an e-mail to the team, with<br/>\n&gt; the links to the various reports (for different &#39;chunks&#39; of code), both<br/>\n&gt; current and previous.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Every morning, I am opening those reports and copying the highest level data<br/>\n&gt; (from the summary section -&gt; #tests, #failures, #errors) into an excel<br/>\n&gt; spreadsheet.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Currently, we are trying to get our testing back under control - many<br/>\n&gt; iterations of allowing people to say their stories were complete without<br/>\n&gt; appropriate - or even working - tests.  Additionally, in the past, we have<br/>\n&gt; found that we have a velocity treshhold - after which our testing goes<br/>\n&gt; downhill.  So, we have a need to maintain this historical information, over<br/>\n&gt; the life of the project.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I am looking for a way to automate this.  What I&#39;m thinking of is:<br/>\n&gt; when the reporting functionality totals the summary numbers, it could also<br/>\n&gt; output to another file type (ideally, straight into an excel spreadsheet;<br/>\n&gt; minimally, into a file that can be used as a data source for a spreadsheet)<br/>\n&gt; a configurable data set: date, time, #tests, #failures, #errors, #time.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Dianne<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -------------- Original message -------------- <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Dianne Doss asked<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Is there an automated way to output the summary data (#tests,<br/>\n&gt; #errors, #failures) from my JUnit Report to an external file<br/>\n&gt; (possibly xls, or a file accessible by spreadsheet) in order to<br/>\n&gt; maintain a history of our results?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; In the ideal world, there would never be any errors or failures, but<br/>\n&gt; the point of the testing is to make us confident in making code<br/>\n&gt; changes.  We run a nightlybuild regression, so the next morning I<br/>\n&gt; can see if I missed anything (sometimes the failures are well<br/>\n&gt; removed from the actual class that was changed).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; So, we would like to be able to record historical data of the<br/>\n&gt; fluctuations.  In the past, manually, we have found that the<br/>\n&gt; errors/failures go up when we get above a certain velocity.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Thanks for any insight that can be provided.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Dianne Doss<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Dear Doss,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;               If you are generating JUnit Report through Ant, definitely you<br/>\n&gt; should write one build.xml file. Before generating new report, why not you<br/>\n&gt; take copy of the previous report.  In Ant API  contains copy tag and move<br/>\n&gt; tag. So<br/>\n&gt; first step you take a back up using Copy/ Move tag.<br/>\n&gt; Second step you clear your old report using delete tag.<br/>\n&gt; Third step create report folder again.<br/>\n&gt; Finally you generate new report.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Paul Domnic J.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Scandent Group<br/>\n&gt; 4th Floor, KRM Centre,<br/>\n&gt; No.2, Harrington Road,<br/>\n&gt; Chetpet,<br/>\n&gt; Chennai 600 031<br/>\n&gt; India<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Tel:+91 44  5211 8090<br/>\n&gt; Fax:+91 44  5211 8068<br/>\n&gt; Important Email Information :- The  information  in  this  email is<br/>\n&gt; confidential and may  be  legally  privileged.
