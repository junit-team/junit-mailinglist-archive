Bossicard wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Someone pointed out a few months ago that the JUnit tests are not \n&gt; executed in\n&gt; the same order depending on the vm used.  If your tests are \n&gt; order-dependant it&#39;s\n&gt; also an issue.\n&gt;\n&gt; Considering that you have simple ways to share resources, I wonder if \n&gt; having one\n&gt; test object and invoking all of its test methods is the best solution.\n&gt;\nOne difference between SuiteRunner&#39;s and JUnit&#39;s design that I believe \nEric Armstrong didn&#39;t hit on is that JUnit&#39;s Test interface has a run \nmethod, a way to run one test. That pretty much dictates that each test \nwill run in its own instance. SuiteRunner&#39;s Suite class has an execute \nmethod, which executes an *entire suite of tests*, not just one test. \nSuite provides a default implementation of the execute method, but it \ncan be overridden.\n\nThe default method discovers and invokes the test methods &quot;in no \nparticular order&quot; on itself (i.e., the same instance), and executes \neach sub-Suite. But if you want those test methods to be invoked in a \nparticular order, you can override execute (or executeTestMethods) in \nyour subclass. Or if you want your test methods to each be invoked in a \nseparate instance a la JUnit, you can override execute and do it the \nJUnit way. As I pointed out to Jacob in my reply to his &quot;JUnit and test \ndata&quot; post earlier this week, another thing you can do is override \nexecute to drive tests from data read in from a database or file, \nrather than using test methods at all. The first time I actually \noverrode execute in a Suite subclass was to create \norg.suiterunner.JUnitSuite, a package access Suite subclass that \nexecutes a suite of JUnit tests. In other words, I implemented running \nJUnit tests from SuiteRunner by creating a Suite subclass whose execute \nmethod knows how to run JUnit tests.\n\nI attempted to provide a default implementation of execute in Suite \nthat I figured would be useful 90% of the time, but tried to leave the \ndoor open for subclasses to execute suites of tests in any other way \nthat suits their designer. That was one big &quot;refactor&quot; of JUnit&#39;s \ndesign that I did in SuiteRunner, because I felt the run method of \nJUnit&#39;s Test interface doesn&#39;t allow for much flexibility in the way \nsuites of tests are executed.\n\n--------\n\nBy the way: Does Yahoo perform extensive background checks on people \nposting to this list before letting each message through?
