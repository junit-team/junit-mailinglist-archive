The test class is checking the\n&gt; dependencies and contents of the Maven artifacts produced by the build.\n&gt; I have some special build requirements which require me to use Maven\n&gt; Shade Plugin to bundle external (and in one case also internal)\n&gt; dependencies into the same JAR, and these build tests have been\n&gt; extremely helpful (more details at the first episodes of\n&gt; http://www.orfjackal.net/lets-code#jumi).\n&gt;\n&gt; https://github.com/orfjackal/jumi/blob/730378ddf5260cdcb44285c5c75e7a7ca5447407/end-to-end-tests/src/test/java/fi/jumi/test/BuildTest.java\n&gt;\n&gt; The first two tests are parameterized. They check each artifact for its\n&gt; expected dependencies and contents.\n&gt;\n&gt; The third test is checking one of the artifacts which was checked\n&gt; already earlier, but this time a copy the JAR which which is embedded\n&gt; inside another JAR (it&#39;s used in bootstrapping the application). Since\n&gt; this test is slow (~150ms), I want to avoid running it many times.\n&gt; Logically it&#39;s related to the things checked by the parameterized tests,\n&gt; so I want to keep it close to them, but it itself is not parameterized.\n&gt; Right now I&#39;ve solved the issue with a hack, so all but one\n&gt; parameterized execution skip the test.\n&gt;\n&gt; The fourth and fifth test are tests against all of the parameters. It&#39;s\n&gt; testing the test data, to make sure that some project-wide principles\n&gt; are followed (i.e. no visible dependencies to external libraries). These\n&gt; tests also are not parameterized. Fortunately they are quick, so I\n&gt; haven&#39;t tried to avoid running them many times.\n&gt;\n&gt; What are your suggestions for mixing parameterized and non-parameterized\n&gt; tests? Some creative use of nested classes?\n&gt;\nDon&#39;t. Put them in separate classes in the same (test) package. It is normal to \nhave one class in the system under test verified by several test classes; there \nis no rule that says there has to be a 1:1 correspondence.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;ve been thinking about extending Parameterized so that I can annotate\n&gt; which methods are parameterized and which are not, by adding either\n&gt; @ParameterizedTest or @NonParameterized annotations to the test methods.\n&gt; The non-parameterized methods would be run only once, probably using the\n&gt; first element in the test data (passing null to the constructor is\n&gt; another option; now it would fail in the constructor, but I should\n&gt; anyways relocate the couple of method calls which are now in the\n&gt; constructor).\n&gt;\nYou are over-complicating the problem.
