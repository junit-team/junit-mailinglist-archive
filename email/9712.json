If you adopt a convention that API methods are only presented<br/>\nvia Java Interfaces instead of concrete classes then you don&#39;t care<br/>\nabout the way the implementers of the Interfaces are written. You can<br/>\nthen make non-API methods within the concrete implementation public<br/>\nwithout implying that they are themselves API methods. <br/>\n<br/>\nYou would also write your API tests for the Java Interfaces and plug in<br/>\nthe concrete implementations to test them. If you need to write tests<br/>\nfor lower-level supporting methods within the concrete classes you can<br/>\ndo that separately, as appropriate and its easy because they are public.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----------------------------<br/>\nMike Silverstein<br/>\nSilverMark, Inc.<br/>\nThe Object Testing Company<br/>\nwww.javatesting.com<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Chirag Shashikant Doshi [mailto:chirag.doshi@...] <br/>\n&gt; Sent: Wednesday, October 15, 2003 11:02 PM<br/>\n&gt; To: junit@yahoogroups.com<br/>\n&gt; Subject: RE: [junit] Re: How to test private methods, its urgent<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Hi Michael<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Personally, I don&#39;t believe in private methods.

Therefore well <br/>\n&gt; tested public <br/>\n&gt; &gt; methods will include the behaviour of the private methods.  <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; There is no real reason for directly testing private methods.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Domain objects support the GUI. By the logic above a well <br/>\n&gt; tested GUI will include the behavior of the domain objects, <br/>\n&gt; so there is no reason to unit test the domain objects :-)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve occasionally found reason to write unit tests for <br/>\n&gt; private, supporting methods. Often you loose efficiency <br/>\n&gt; testing supporting methods indirectly via their caller - such <br/>\n&gt; as in the case where you want to test their ability to <br/>\n&gt; properly handle a range of input values. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Personally, I don&#39;t believe in private methods. I&#39;d rather <br/>\n&gt; make everything public and testable and expose real APIs via <br/>\n&gt; Java Interfaces.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; To answer the original poster: google junit + &quot;private methods&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ---<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>---<br/>\nOutgoing mail is certified Virus Free.<br/>\nChecked by AVG anti-virus system (http://www.grisoft.com).<br/>\nVersion: 6.0.522 / Virus Database: 320 - Release Date: 9/29/2003</div>",
