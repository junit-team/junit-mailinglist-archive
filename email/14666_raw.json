Doesn’t it?\n&gt; \n\nOnly if you guess right about where the problem is. I can accept a quick \ntest of a private method as exploratory coding and a convenience, \nprovided that before fixing the alleged bug you verify it with a test of \nthe same thing that goes through the public API, and that you remove the \nprivate test after debugging and before final shipment.\n\nHowever, the experience of figuring out exactly how the private method \nis invoked often reveals more about the code than merely looking at the \nprivate method through a peephole. Sometimes the bug turns out not to be \nwhat I thought it was. Sometimes I discover that the bug in fact cannot \noccur through the public API. This enables me to take shortcuts and make \noptimizations in private methods that I could not do in public methods. \nOften the sheer process of thinking in depth about the  execution path \ninto the private method reveals aspects of the code I did not previously \nunderstand and shows me how to improve and refactor the code so \nradically that the problem vanishes completely.\n\n-- \n﻿Elliotte Rusty Harold  elharo@...\nXML in a Nutshell 3rd Edition Just Published!\nhttp://www.cafeconleche.org/books/xian3/\nhttp://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0596007647/cafeaulaitA/ref=nosim\n\n",
