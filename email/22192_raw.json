BUT in some cases this solution can be =\r\na desirable one. Therefore I think this solution, along with others (see be=\r\nlow) should be provided.\n\nMy current need for global rules is:\n- I am devel=\r\noping a Swing console, called TestUI, that will allow you to visually see t=\r\nhe results of your tests, the tests that failed and those that succeeded. Y=\r\nou will also be able to specify a path to watch for Surefire reports, there=\r\nfore combining analytical functions with report functions (the report funct=\r\nions are those for which I need global rules).\n\n@David: I took a look at Ru=\r\nnListener, and indeed it solves my problem (just like a TestWatchman-derive=\r\nd rule would), except that it is very inconvenient to use. For example, at =\r\nwork I have 110 modules, and a total number of 800 unit tests. I would like=\r\n to globally hook up my TestUIAgentRule, to report to my TestUI console eac=\r\nh test that is executed.\n\nI execute the tests from Eclipse or from Maven, d=\r\nuring build sessions. Therefore I cannot use RunListener or a Rule for this=\r\n. I need some global mechanism to enable a Rule for all the executed tests.=\r\n\n\nExcept for JVM params, here is another idea: having a junit properties/XM=\r\nL configuration file. It has been suggested on this message group that juni=\r\nt should have a configuration file, and I am PRO this solution.\n\nIn such a =\r\nconfig file (available soomewhere in the classpath, like the log4j.properti=\r\nes), we could specifiy:\n- which tests to execute/exclude/ignore\n- global ru=\r\nles\n- test suites to run/exclude\n- categories to run/exclude\n\nThis could al=\r\nso solve this problem: http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/junit/message/221=\r\n84. The request here (read the first post in the thread) asks for a GUI whe=\r\nre unit tests could be disabled, like light bulbs (PS: my TestUI console wi=\r\nll be able to do this, sometime in the \nfuture releases).\n\nWhat do you thin=\r\nk of this?\n\nCheers,\nBogdan\n\n--- In junit@yahoogroups.com, Joakim Ohlrogge &lt;=\r\njoakim.ohlrogge@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi Bogdan,\n&gt; \n&gt; I can see where you&#39;re comi=\r\nng from with system properties to solve this.\n&gt; I would much rather have so=\r\nme way of solving this where you would not have\n&gt; to rely on a property bei=\r\nng set at the JVM-level. The reason is that it&#39;s\n&gt; very inconvenient to hav=\r\ne to set run parameters if you just want to rerun a\n&gt; single test (in eclip=\r\nse that&#39;s a run configuration rather than just\n&gt; rightclicking on a test in=\r\n the runner). If JUnit instead would look for a\n&gt; standard property-file or=\r\n similar (like junit-rules.properties in the root\n&gt; of your class-path and =\r\nmerge all found resources found like\n&gt; getClass().getClassLoader().getResou=\r\nrces(&quot;/junit-rules.properties&quot;) then it\n&gt; would just work with no external =\r\nconfiguration like launch parameters or\n&gt; script parameters.\n&gt; \n&gt; With VM-p=\r\narameters I don&#39;t see that the feature would be useful for anything\n&gt; that =\r\ninfluences the testrun, just for collecting information about the run.\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; -----------------------------------------------------\n&gt; Joakim Ohlrogge=\r\n\n&gt; Agical AB\n&gt; V=E4sterl=E5nggatan 79, 2 tr\n&gt; 111 29 Stockholm, SWEDEN\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n Mobile: +46-708-754004\n&gt; Blog: johlrogge.wordpress.com\n&gt; E-mail: joakim.oh=\r\nlrogge@...\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; On Sat, Dec 5, 2009 at 8:46 PM, Bogdan &lt;\n&gt; bogdan.mocanu=\r\n.notifications@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Hi guys,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; thank you very m=\r\nuch for your responses.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I didn&#39;t know about the RunListener, so I w=\r\nill definitely take a look at\n&gt; &gt; it, and come back with an answer regardin=\r\ng it.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; What I was thinking about the global rules is to be able to c=\r\nonfigure\n&gt; &gt; something like global rules, that are specified as a startup p=\r\narameter (read\n&gt; &gt; Java option) when starting the test (in the project at m=\r\ny office, we have\n&gt; &gt; like 750 tests, and therefore would work just nice to=\r\n configure this option\n&gt; &gt; just for my env; probably the RunListener will w=\r\nork just like that, so as I\n&gt; &gt; said, I will read about this).\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I wa=\r\ns thinking about something like this:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; java\n&gt; &gt; -Djunit.globalRules=\r\n=3Dcom.test.myrules.SomeNiceRule,com.test.myrules.SomeNiceRule2\n&gt; &gt; .......=\r\n...\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Cheers,\n&gt; &gt; Bogdan\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; --- In junit@yahoogroups.com &lt;ju=\r\nnit%40yahoogroups.com&gt;, &quot;Bogdan&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;bogdan.mocanu.notifications@&gt; wrote:\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Hi everyone,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; as we have it currently, we can place =\r\na Rule in a test, and that rule\n&gt; &gt; will be activated for that test. To hav=\r\ne the rule working in several tests,\n&gt; &gt; you have to place the Rule in each=\r\n test.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; However, I am searching for a way to activate a Rule for=\r\n all the tests\n&gt; &gt; that are executed, without needing to add the rule to ea=\r\nch test. Perhaps by\n&gt; &gt; specifying a Java property parameter when running t=\r\nhe tests (I could also\n&gt; &gt; set this as a global Java option, therefore bein=\r\ng used upon each execution\n&gt; &gt; of the JVM).\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Do you know if this=\r\n is possible?\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; The reason why I need this, is: I am making the p=\r\nlans and gathering the\n&gt; &gt; ideas for creating a simple Swing application th=\r\nat will display the results\n&gt; &gt; of the executed tests (just like the JUnit =\r\nview in Eclipse/Idea/Netbeans,\n&gt; &gt; but perhaps with more details, and also =\r\navailable for anyone, not just IDE\n&gt; &gt; users). Currently I developed a smal=\r\nl agent rule, that you can place in your\n&gt; &gt; test, and it will report to th=\r\ne console the status of your tests (the Swing\n&gt; &gt; console runs remotely).\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; This is ok, but it means that you will have to add this rule to =\r\neach and\n&gt; &gt; every test that you have. It also means that will not be an ea=\r\nsy task to\n&gt; &gt; disable this rule, if you don&#39;t want it anymore.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n Therefore a possibility to enable Rules globally for all tests I think is\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; the best solution for my case, and also a good tool to have for various=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; other tasks.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; What do you think? Also, what do you think ab=\r\nout the Swing console idea?\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Cheers,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Bogdan\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt;\n\n\n\n",
