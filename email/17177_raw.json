I don&#39;t like reflection either. \nMy continued belief is that classes should be tested through their \npublic interfaces. I&#39;ve elucidated the reasons here in the past. Rather \nthan reiterating them here, perhaps it&#39;s time to write up something a \nlittle more formal on my blog so I can just point to it in the future.\n\n&gt; I like reflection, but after bingeing on it when I was young and foolish \n&gt; I now tend to avoid it. I&#39;m uncomfortable using reflection and fiddling \n&gt; with run-time modifiers solely for the purposes of calling a private \n&gt; method from a test case.\n\nI completely agree.\n\n&gt; As I originally stated (and elaborated upon by Joakim), I would suggest \n&gt; instead analysing exactly _why_ the private method needs testing. If it \n&gt; is sufficiently important to require a test case, does its functionality \n&gt; merit a change in access modifier? Is its behaviour sufficiently \n&gt; different to that of the parent class that an extraction to a public \n&gt; helper class might be possible?\n&gt; \n\nIf the behavior is general enough that you want it to be public *for \nreasons other than testing* then by all means, go ahead and make it \npublic. But don&#39;t let the tail wag the dog. If the only reason you want \nit public is for testing, then use the public interface instead.\n\n-- \n﻿Elliotte Rusty Harold  elharo@...\nJava I/O 2nd Edition Just Published!\nhttp://www.cafeaulait.org/books/javaio2/\nhttp://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0596527500/ref=nosim/cafeaulaitA/\n\n",
