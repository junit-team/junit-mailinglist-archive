I&#39;m sorry, but it seems to me \n&gt; that there is litt=\r\nle or no use of the framework, ant has \n&gt; effectively re-written it. Sure, =\r\nit is nice that a\n&gt; framework can have extension points, but it seems a sha=\r\nme to need to\n&gt; leverage so many. It seems (from reading this) that ant lev=\r\nerages the\n&gt; testcase class &quot;assert&quot; helper methods & little else.\n\nAnt doe=\r\nsn&#39;t &quot;leverage&quot; much of anything from JUnit except the TestListener interfa=\r\nce, which it even extends because the TestListener interface doesn&#39;t specif=\r\ny event handlers for suite starts and ends.  This is as it should be, I thi=\r\nnk, although JUnit&#39;s junit.runner.* package could be vastly improved with a=\r\n small amount of work so that it&#39;s contribution to the world of test runner=\r\ns was a little more useful.\n\nThe way to look at it is that Ant and other to=\r\nols built on and around JUnit like JUnitPerf, Eclipse and Artima SuiteRunne=\r\nr *support* what has become the de facto standard API for writing unit test=\r\ns in Java.  Funny, perhaps, that JUnit helped achieve this by shipping with=\r\n what I consider &quot;reference implementation&quot; test runners.  Think of them th=\r\nat way and maybe your perspective will change.\n\nJUnit&#39;s most important cont=\r\nribution (IMHO) are the interfaces in junit.framework.* -- not the test run=\r\nners, which for some reason have become the focus here.  Think of it like t=\r\nhe Servlet API or EJB or whatever.  The JCP provides an API, some tech spec=\r\ns, and a reference implementation which allow vendors to provide containers=\r\n that support the API, add extra features and basically build a cottage ind=\r\nustry around it.\n\nScott Stirling\nFramingham, MA\n\n\n",
