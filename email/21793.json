I have a class under test and to test each of the methods of the class there are different test methods in my test class. Now testing all these methods requires different test data. Here is where my question lies, is it possible to annotate the test method to somehow say use these setup methods, or use this setup method.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I can obviously include the data population code within my test method. But in my situation there can be two test methods that require the same setup and this would then mean code duplication.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Right now the only way I can think of is to create these setup methods and call them individually from all my test methods which require that setup. Is that the right way to go about this?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thanks<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Yahoo!
