We understand. That&#39;s why we are <br/>\nbringing the successful &quot;XP Day&quot; concept to North America, starting in <br/>\nToronto, Ontario, Canada.<br/>\n<br/>\nXP Day is a one-day event especially for those who want to get started <br/>\nlearning about Extreme Programming from the best minds in the community. <br/>\nIt has a little something for everyone, whether you&#39;re:<br/>\n<br/>\n     * An executive wondering how XP can improve the contribution your <br/>\nsoftware organization makes to the bottom line,<br/>\n     * A manager looking for ways to increase your team&#39;s effectiveness,<br/>\n     * A skeptic, hoping to challenge the most experienced and outspoken <br/>\nXP practitioners,<br/>\n     * A programmer itching to experience a real XP project room,<br/>\n     * An experienced practitioner, hoping to share ideas with other <br/>\nexperienced practitioners<br/>\n<br/>\nAlthough the tutorials are aimed at beginners, Open Space plays a major <br/>\nrole in this event, giving XPerienced people an opportunity to come <br/>\ntogether for a day and share their ideas without the limitations of <br/>\ne-mail. This group, being identified as a gathering place for XP <br/>\npractitioners, will receive a separate invitation to the Open Space <br/>\nportion of the event. We certainly hope you&#39;ll join us!<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJ. B.
