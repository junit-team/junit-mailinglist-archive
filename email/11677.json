    "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1324291264\">Hy,<br/>\n<br/>\nafter some lurking on this list and following the discussions that happen <br/>\nhere I&#39;ve come to the conclusion that the tests I&#39;m currently running on <br/>\nmy project(s) are not really unit tests, although they use JUnit. As far <br/>\nas I can tell they can be more accurately described as beeing <br/>\nfunctionality tests as they usually test one use case end-to-end. That <br/>\ncame into beeing, since when I joined the project there were no tests at <br/>\nall (aside from a few bit-rotted functionallity tests) and I started <br/>\nwriting what I thought at that time to be unit tests.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor example there are several tests that define a query (defined in OQL <br/>\n(similar to SQL, but working on an object level)) that get&#39;s converted to <br/>\nSQL, run on the database, the result retrieved, converted to java objects <br/>\nand then my test checks wether the objects are exactly the objects that <br/>\nwere expected. I think I do have a rather clean idea how this could be <br/>\nsplit into unit tests, only the system I&#39;m testing is not modular enough <br/>\nto allow this. (And to refactor it I&#39;d need more tests, that I can&#39;t write <br/>\n&#39;till it&#39;s refactored ... a classical catch-22).<br/>\n<br/>\nFortunately there is some heavy refactoring in the future of this project <br/>\nthat will allow me to introduce more &quot;real&quot; unit tests ...<br/>\n<br/>\nThe reason I write all this down is that I&#39;d like to hear wether anyone of <br/>\nyou has any experience/good advice for this kind of unit-test-free legacy <br/>\nsystem. I&#39;d be interested how you use functionality tests (in addition to <br/>\nunit tests?) and wether anyone knows any tools that are better suited for <br/>\nthis kind of job than JUnit.<br/>\n<br/>\nregards<br/>\nJoachim Sauer<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",
