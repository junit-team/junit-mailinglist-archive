At some level stochastic methods just\naren&#39;t testable in the same way that deterministic methods are.  If\nyou&#39;re writing a sorting routine, it should sort.  Period.  End of\ndiscussion.  If, however, you&#39;re simulating the roll of a six-sided\ndie, then the best you can hope for is statistically plausible\nresults, and it&#39;s then essentially impossible to tell the difference\nbetween a bug and a weird streak of luck in the random number\ngenerator.  (If your die simulation turns up &#39;3&#39; one hundred times in\na row it&#39;s _probably_ a bug, but it might just be a _highly_ unlikely\nevent resulting from your pseudo-random number generator.)\n\nAt the moment we&#39;ve got some hacks where we call methods repeatedly\n(i.e., it&#39;s _slow_), and assert that the standard deviation of the\nresults is below some arbitrary bound.  The bound was chosen by trial\nand error, running the tests over and over and putting the bound at a\npoint where the tests fail about one time in 10.  This is obviously\ncheesy in the extreme.\n\nPresumably we&#39;re not the first people to have wandered into this tar\npit, and I was wondering if anyone out there had solutions, pointers,\nideas, etc.\n\nMany thanks,\n\n\tNic McPhee\n\tmcphee@...\n\tDivision of Science and Mathematics\n\tUniversity of Minnesota, Morris\n\n\n\n",
