(I use this class to run all the unit<br/>\n&gt; tests in my project). This is rather annoying, and I read somewhere that<br/>\n&gt; there is a tool for automatically creating test suites, rather than<br/>\n&gt; maintaining a class like this by hand. As I remember, it was a case of<br/>\n&gt; pointing this tool at your classpath and it would go away and find all your<br/>\n&gt; test classes and create a suite for them. Does such a tool exist? Can anyone<br/>\n&gt; tell me where I can get it? I had a look around junit.org but I couldn&#39;t see<br/>\n&gt; anything like it.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It was an article in JavaWorld, &quot;JUnit Best Practices&quot; and it had source<br/>\nattached to it for bp.TestAll which recurses through a class structure on<br/>\ndisk and runs every test class it encounters.  There was a thread here<br/>\na few weeks ago, I think, where I helped someone get it running.  It&#39;s<br/>\nquite particular about the classpath.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, it appears JavaWorld&#39;s website has moved the article, the link I<br/>\nhave for it is broken today. :(<br/>\n<br/>\nI have the original source zip, if you can&#39;t find it on JavaWorld&#39;s website,<br/>\nemail me privately and I&#39;ll send it to you.  I don&#39;t have the original<br/>\narticle in electronic format, though.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor what it&#39;s worth, I don&#39;t have the update problem any longer since I<br/>\nstarted using the uTest OpenTool with JBuilder.  Whenver I create a new<br/>\napplication class and hit &#39;Syncronize&#39; it creates the test class stub<br/>\nand updates the AllTests.java file automatically.  It&#39;s sweet.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJoi Ellis                    Software Engineer<br/>\nAravox Technologies          <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:joi@...\">joi@...</a>, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:gyles19@...\">gyles19@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\nNo matter what we think of Linux versus FreeBSD, etc., the one thing I<br/>\nreally like about Linux is that it has Microsoft worried.
