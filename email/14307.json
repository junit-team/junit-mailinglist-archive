I am saying so because i think i had the same concept when i started with it but junit is a unit test a developer has to write for a class that he/she writes . So dont worry about it much and overall its more challenging than the real coding itself and will teach u a lot . For any books you can consult Junit recipies and get going ... All the best <br/>\n <br/>\nCheers<br/>\n <br/>\nDanmeet <br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\n Start your day with Yahoo! - make it your home page <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",
