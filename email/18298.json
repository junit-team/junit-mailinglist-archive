The setup is pretty trivial using RAD and Websphere, not sure <br/>\nhow it would work in the environment mentioned.  I&#39;ve also tested EJB&#39;s <br/>\nusing JUnit against JBoss.  If I recall, for JBoss it was just a matter of <br/>\nhaving the right classpath. <br/>\n<br/>\nI suggest looking at that option. <br/>\n<br/>\n-j<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Joakim Ohlrogge&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:joakim.ohlrogge@...\">joakim.ohlrogge@...</a>&gt; <br/>\nSent by: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n11/02/2006 09:56 AM<br/>\nPlease respond to<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nTo<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\ncc<br/>\n<br/>\nSubject<br/>\nRe: [junit] Using JUnit Inside Application Server?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe reason would be that it is generally a bit more time consuming to<br/>\npackage and run your tests in an application server than it is from your<br/>\nIDE. That is why I suggested running as big part as possible outside the<br/>\ncontainer during developmenttime.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf running your tests often does not feel that important then by all means<br/>\nrun them inside a container. I&#39;m currently working with weblogic and I <br/>\ncan&#39;t<br/>\nimagine TDD:ing if I would need to deploy my new code in the container in<br/>\norder to run my tests. It is simply too tedious. In my case 95% of the <br/>\ncode<br/>\nhas nothing to do with EJB:s whatsoever so i don&#39;t see that much added <br/>\nvalue<br/>\nof executing the unittests inside the container.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat is just my opinion and also the reason why i don&#39;t know the answer to<br/>\nhow to run the tests inside the container. I never did it. Maybe it is<br/>\neasier in other containers.<br/>\n<br/>\n/J<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On 11/2/06, Cédric Beust ? &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:cbeust@...\">cbeust@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; On 11/2/06, Joakim Ohlrogge &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:joakim.ohlrogge@...\">joakim.ohlrogge@...</a><br/>\n&lt;joakim.ohlrogge%40gmail.com&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Extract as much as possible to classes that can be tested outside of <br/>\nthe<br/>\n&gt; &gt; application server.

I&#39;m not convinced that it is <br/>\na<br/>\n&gt; &gt; good idea to use those frameworks. I never felt had the need.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I think in those cases deploy your application and run your tests as a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; client.

The easiest way is <br/>\nprobably<br/>\n&gt; to package your tests in their own application (or bundle them with the<br/>\n&gt; application you are trying to test) and run them as a regular Java EE<br/>\n&gt; application.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --<br/>\n&gt; Cédric<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nNEW!
