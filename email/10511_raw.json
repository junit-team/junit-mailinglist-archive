An assertNotNull for the same member variable fails\n&gt; at the beginning of the next test method.\n\n&gt; Does junit initialize all member variables to null between tests?\n&gt; If so, how can I avoid it? I tried to implement blank setUp() and\n&gt; tearDown() methods, but that did not work.\n\nEach test runs in its own instance of your test class, so the second test\nruns in a completely different instance of your class hence the NPE.  Why\nare you setting a variable within one test for use within another test?\nThat sounds like some test-coupling you probably don&#39;t want.\n\nYou use setUp() to construct a fixture that is common across all methods\nwithin your test case - this is one way of defining some known object\nstate(s) that you can then assert within your tests.  \n\nJonathan\n\n\n\n",
