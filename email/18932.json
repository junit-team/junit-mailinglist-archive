That first test is always<br/>\nvery expensive, especially if it&#39;s an area of your product that has no tests<br/>\nat all.  It all gets better after that.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope it helps, and looking forward to other people&#39;s answers.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nCédric<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://testng.org\">http://testng.org</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On 2/16/07, felix3142 &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:f.noz@...\">f.noz@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   Hello,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; we&#39;re going to establish unit-testing (basically for web applications)<br/>\n&gt; in our company. Because we don&#39;t want to change the whole programming<br/>\n&gt; paradigm to XP we rather want to use a test-last method in the<br/>\n&gt; beginning and then watch out for further steps.<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m now in the process of investigating the basic requirements and<br/>\n&gt; conditions.<br/>\n&gt; One question that occured is if it&#39;s possible to quantify the amount<br/>\n&gt; of extra time you need when using unit testing compared to the<br/>\n&gt; non-testing approach. I solely refer to the writing of unit tests.<br/>\n&gt; Later saving of time (by better code) shouldn&#39;t be considered. So<br/>\n&gt; what&#39;s your experience? Can anybody do a statement about time<br/>\n&gt; consumption of writing unit tests?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Regards<br/>\n&gt; Felix<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed] </span></blockquote></div>",
