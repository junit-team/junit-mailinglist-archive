    "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1586309762\">Do you want to validate that the .jsp file is a valid JSP document, or <br/>\ndo you want to validate that the output of the .jsp file (probably HTML <br/>\netc.) is valid? Both options are valid, but are definitely not the same <br/>\nthing.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy original question that started this thread was more aimed at the <br/>\nsecond option (validating the output of the JSP, not the contents of the <br/>\n.jsp file itself).<br/>\n<br/>\nI am not aware of any validators for the &quot;common&quot; JSP format that most <br/>\npeople use. When I say &quot;common&quot; I mean a JSP in which you have scriplet, <br/>\nexpressions and declaration tags mixed with taglibs, jsp tags and <br/>\ntemplate tags. The obvious reason for this is that these documents don&#39;t <br/>\nreally follow a nice referenceable document model (i.e. they are not <br/>\nreadily XML parseable). If you can write a JSP using the JSP XML syntax <br/>\n(detailed in the JSP spec) then you can validate with a regular <br/>\nvalidating XML parser. The trick is that it becomes cumbersome to <br/>\ninclude valid XML tags around all the embedded Java code throughout the <br/>\npage - this is the reason we opted not to bother.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, there seems to be some light on the horizon to solve this <br/>\nproblem. We have been experimenting with the EL features from JSTL and <br/>\nhave found we can eliminate most, if not all, of our scriptlets etc. In <br/>\nthis case the need for cumbersome additional XML tags disappears and <br/>\nwriting the JSP in the XML syntax becomes pretty easy. Then you could <br/>\nuse the previously mentioned validating XML parser to validate your JSPs.<br/>\n<br/>\nCraig<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYagiz Erkan wrote on 9/8/2004, 6:47 AM:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">  &gt; Is there something similar for JSP validation?<br/>\n &gt;<br/>\n &gt; - Yagiz -<br/>\n &gt;<br/>\n &gt;<br/>\n &gt;<br/>\n &gt;<br/>\n &gt;<br/>\n &gt; Yahoo!
