As you pointed\nout, when that much dependency exists, it became much more of a functional\nacceptance test instead of a unit test of a single component.  That being\nsaid, I have ended up having to deal with it, and created a TestSetup\nsubclass to act as a wrapper around the actual test cases.  The TestSetup\nclass then implemented a setup( ) method to call all the necessary other\ncomponents to add test data, and then implemented a tearDown( ) method to\nclean it up afterword.   But I agree with you, that does end up being more\nthan a pure Unit Test.\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: Geoff Bache [mailto:geoff@...]\nSent: Friday, December 29, 2000 6:39 AM\nTo: junit@egroups.com\nSubject: [junit] Re: testing distributed components\n\n\n--- In junit@egroups.com, Kevin Bourrillion &lt;kevinb@m...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Hi,\n&gt;  \n&gt; As the name &quot;unit testing&quot; suggests, your best bet is to test each\nof your\n&gt; components one by one, in isolation.  But as you say, that can be\ntricky\n&gt; when the input to your component needs to come from some other\ncomponent.\n&gt; In these cases you may find it worthwhile to invest the time to\ncreate test\n&gt; stubs for these objects.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Here&#39;s an elementary example:  Suppose you&#39;re testing the &quot;foo&quot;\nmethod of\n&gt; your &quot;Comp&quot; component.  However, this method requires a &quot;Bar&quot; object\nto be\n&gt; passed in, and the only way to get one of these is to interact with\nsome\n&gt; other component(s)--something of a unit-testing &quot;no-no.&quot;\n&gt;  \n&gt;     public interface Comp {\n&gt;         public void foo(Bar bar);\n&gt;     }\n&gt;  \n&gt; What you want to do is create another implementation of the Bar\ninterface\n&gt; called TestBar, which returns dummy test data instead of doing\nactual work.\n&gt; (If Bar is not already an interface, renaming it something like\nBarImpl and\n&gt; making Bar an interface!)  Then create an instance of this TestBar\nobject to\n&gt; test your foo() method with.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Does this help, or is it too elementary?\n\nHi,\n\nThanks for this, I have a similar problem...\n\nMy problem is not so much component dependencies (I guess everyone has\nthose), but proliferation of data which it&#39;s very hard to create\ndummy versions of. This is because the data depends on other data,\nand is typically meaningless without it.\n\nTo give a concrete description, we work with airline resource\noptimization. Suppose I want to test the flight connections module. I\ncan&#39;t do this without creating some connection data. Connection data\nis meaningless without flight data. Flight data is meaningless without\naircraft and airport data. Then you need aircraft type, and\nlocation descriptions, and so on.\n\nAlso, the nature of optimization is such that, generally, testing\nanything using 2 airports and one flight is not going to tell you\nanything meaningful about whether anything works or not. Thus creating\nmanageable amounts of dummy data is problematic in itself.\n\nOf course, I can use real data, and all the necessary components to\nload and manipulate it. But then I&#39;m barely unit-testing, am I?\nIt basically turns into functional testing in any case.\n\nDoes anyone have any insights/experience of similar problems?\n\nGeoff Bache\n\n\n\nTo unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\njunit-unsubscribe@egroups.com\n\n\n\n\n",
