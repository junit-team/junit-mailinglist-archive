If we need to narrow the set of\nStrings that are allowed, then we use constraints on\nthe parameters again.  Then we could test that what we\nexpect to happen given disallowed parameters happens,\nand what we expect given permitted parameters happens.\n\nThis stuff is sort of obvious, but I figured I&#39;d throw\nit into the mix.\n\nHappy New Year All,\n- Ole\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nTired of spam?
