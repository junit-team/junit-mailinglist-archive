( Here I mean commercial project rather than<br/>\n&gt; &gt; open-source project. )<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I tend to see it taking longer. Considering that you are least doubling <br/>\n&gt; (is this an english<br/>\n&gt; verb? :-) ) the quantity of code you write I would say this is the reason.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I want to emphasize the point again (already made by Kent and J.B.) that <br/>\nthis type of reasoning assumes that the limiting factor in developing <br/>\nsoftware is typing out the code.  I encourage developers to watch themselves <br/>\nor their team for a day to observe what percentage of the time is really <br/>\nspent in typing code vs. other activities.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf the limiting factor were typing then yes, writing twice as many lines of <br/>\ncode would take longer.  If the limiting factor is really other activities: <br/>\ncommunicating with the rest of the team, understanding the problem, <br/>\ndesigning, finding and fixing errors, then it is not inconceivable that <br/>\npracticing TDD with JUnit can give you an overall speedup.  The trick is <br/>\nlearning how to integrate JUnit as part of all of these other <br/>\nactivites--activities which all software developers perform.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat has been my personal experience and the experience of our teams writing <br/>\ncommercial software (usually with fixed-time, fixed-price contracts) for the <br/>\nlast 5 years.  Consistent JUnit testing by the whole team--using <br/>\nTDD--decreases the time it takes to produce production-ready software.<br/>\n<br/>\nSorry but you hit one of my hot buttons.  :-)  Programming is NOT about the <br/>\ntyping.<br/>\n<br/>\nJeff<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJeff Nielsen | Chief Scientist | Digital Focus<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jeff.nielsen@...\">jeff.nielsen@...</a> | www.digitalfocus.com</div>",
