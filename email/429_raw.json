Write a mock (or stub) File class that can be setup to simulate system\n&gt; &gt; failures. This one sounds like too much effort, especially since File is\n&gt; &gt; not an interface. Also this approach only tests the system style failure\n&gt; &gt; and not the jvm failure.\n&gt;\n&gt;It&#39;s not easy to provide a sensible stub for the File class since File is\n&gt;only an encapsulation of the file name. You have to write stub streams as\n&gt;well which do the real input/output stuff.\n\nYou are absolutely correct - in my zeal to simplify (and in my early \nmorning caffeine-free haze) I replaced references to our internal class \nXmlFile with File and it lost a lot in the translation !\n\n&gt;My suggestion would be to\n&gt;introduce an interface which covers only your special requirements, e.g.\n&gt;\n&gt;public interface MyFile {\n&gt;     PrintWriter getWriter();\n&gt;     BufferedReader getReader();\n&gt;     boolean exists();\n&gt;}\n&gt;\n&gt;That way you can easily introduce a mock implementation which provides you\n&gt;with the mock writer and reader instances.\n\nThat was my thought exactly.\n\n\n&gt;However, it might not be worth the effort.\n\nDitto.\n\nRobert\n\n\n",
