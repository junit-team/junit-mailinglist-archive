I can see why the System.out.println() is<br/>\n&gt; &gt; redundant here, since the assertEquals will provide the actual<br/>\n&gt; &gt; length of the vector on failure. But generally, when and where<br/>\n&gt; &gt; are diagnostic messages in tests appropriate? Do you have a problem<br/>\n&gt; &gt; with System.out.println() or diagnostic messages in tests in general?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; System.out.println got lost, assertXYZ don&#39;t.  If an assert message <br/>\n&gt; doesn&#39;t give you enough information to debug your code, then maybe the <br/>\n&gt; assert is not doing enough.  A least that&#39;s what I think.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>What about <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://apricot.sourceforge.net/\">http://apricot.sourceforge.net/</a> ?<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;During their execution, the classes have access to <br/>\nexternal ressources (database or network connections...) <br/>\nvia Services and can use the Logger to save useful information.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nVladamir, are you saying you don&#39;t need such a Logger any more?<br/>\n<br/>\nMy own preference is to use log4j events in tests so I can<br/>\nmonitor what is going on, which is especially useful when a test<br/>\nfails. I accept that System.out is rather primitive, but if your<br/>\ntest runner is able to capture the output to this stream and<br/>\npresent it with the test, then it doesn&#39;t have to get lost.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m interested in this stuff because I&#39;m interested in the process<br/>\ndifferent programmers choose to adopt when using JUnit. For example,<br/>\nwhen you write a failing test you can often get it to pass once you<br/>\nimplement the functionality. Sometimes, however, the test still fails<br/>\nunexpectedly. That&#39;s why tests are so useful, they tell you you&#39;ve made<br/>\na mistake immediately. Programmers who don&#39;t write tests would assume<br/>\nat the point of implementation that they hadn&#39;t made a mistake and<br/>\ncontinue with the next task.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow do people fix such a failing test? What information do you use to<br/>\ndiagnose and fix it? Or is it always the time to reach for your<br/>\ndebugger?<br/>\n<br/>\nMalcolm</div>",
