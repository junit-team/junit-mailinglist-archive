Rainsberger wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt;  &gt; I understand you don&#39;t believe in polluting the public API, but saying\n&gt;  &gt; that that suggestion won&#39;t solve the problem is ridiculous.\n&gt; \n&gt; It won&#39;t. There is already a test. That test is breaking. Once you have\n&gt; a breaking test you don&#39;t change the API in any way until you&#39;ve fixed\n&gt; the breakage. This is a basic principle of test driven development. This\n&gt; has nothing to with making things public or not.\n\nIf you have a failing test, but you aren&#39;t sure why it fails, and you \nsuspect the problem is in a private method, what do you generally do?\n\nHere&#39;s what I generally do:\n\n1. Back out the failing test.\n2. Make the private method public.\n3. Write a failing test for the smaller method.\n4. Fix it.\n5. Refactor.\n6. Put the original failing test back to make sure it now passes. If it \ndoesn&#39;t, then something else must be broken, so I repeat the process on \nthat.\n7. When everything is passing, refactor again.\n\nSo what do you do differently than I do?\n\n&gt; However making it public certainly won&#39;t cure the problem. I would\n&gt; compare that to taking off your pants in response to a bad sunburn on\n&gt; your nose. It won&#39;t help, and it will more than likely make things worse.\n\nI honestly don&#39;t see how this analogy matters. The nose and the pants \nhave nothing to do with one another, although in our situation, the some \npublic method invokes the private method we think is broken. At least \nthere is a relationship between the two.\n\nDon&#39;t worry about the analogy. Even if I followed it, I don&#39;t think it \nwould help me understand your position any more. I would much prefer \nknowing what you do in the above case. There&#39;s obviously something I&#39;m \nmissing.\n\nTake care.\n-- \nJ. B.
