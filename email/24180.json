I was expecting Cupcakes, Donuts and Eclairs for lunch on Thurs <br/>\nwhen I visit Google (London) for lunch tomorrow :)]<br/>\n<br/>\nOne possible change from 4 including the libraries would be to pull out <br/>\na junit-core, which would define the runners and interfaces.<br/>\n<br/>\nPerhaps there would also be a junit4-compat or something which would <br/>\nallow breaking changes to be adapted to run via existing JUnit4 <br/>\ninterfaces, or the other way around, for JUnit4 to be able to run <br/>\nseamlessly from new APIs via adapters.<br/>\n<br/>\nCertainly ensuring a smooth transition is important, given the number of <br/>\nplace JUnit is consumed.  I&#39;d say it&#39;ll also be important to allow them <br/>\nto upgrade to the JUnit 5 API for better features<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On 18/12/12 17:35, David Saff wrote:<br/>\n&gt; Thinking more about this, I think that what defines JUnit, as Neale points<br/>\n&gt; out, is its philosophy, and the community of people who buy into that<br/>\n&gt; philosophy.  So I think that when considering a new version, we could<br/>\n&gt; certainly consider strongly following the design examples of other<br/>\n&gt; frameworks, like Jumi or others, but in the end, a JUnit 5 would be built<br/>\n&gt; piece by piece by submissions to this community.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I think also that the compatibility between JUnit 3 and JUnit 4 was<br/>\n&gt; instrumental in making it useful for teams, and I&#39;d like to see a similar<br/>\n&gt; focus on backward compatibility moving forward.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; One last thought: one of the biggest confusions about JUnit 4 was the fact<br/>\n&gt; that it was both a version number referring to a new release of a software<br/>\n&gt; package, _and_ the only useful name for the collection of new libraries<br/>\n&gt; included in that release.  Starting in JUnit 5, I think a different naming<br/>\n&gt; scheme would be quite helpful.  Choosing a scheme that I&#39;m positive we<br/>\n&gt; _won&#39;t_ use, for example:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; - The runner and interfaces introduced in JUnit &lt;= 3 would be JUnit Cupcake<br/>\n&gt; - The runner and interfaces introduced in JUnit 4 would be JUnit Donut<br/>\n&gt; - The runner and interfaces introduced in JUnit 5 would be JUnit Eclair<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thanks,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;     David<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>",
