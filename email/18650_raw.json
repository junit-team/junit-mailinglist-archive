QA wants to run some\ntests, I guess, more functional than unit test... and a senior colleague\nhas suggested to me to use JUnit. I have never written any test for QA\nbefore and I don&#39;t know what tool is better out there and so I just take\nadvice from the person who has used JUnit before and highly recommend\nit. As for testing subset of the tests, it&#39;s just an option, when they\nwant to check something specifically and not have to test the whole suit\n(for example, some tests fail and they need to re-test only those with\ndifferent parameters on another run). \n\n \n\nVietchau\n\n \n\n________________________________\n\nFrom: junit@yahoogroups.com [mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com] On Behalf Of\nMike Bria\nSent: Thursday, January 04, 2007 4:17 PM\nTo: junit@yahoogroups.com\nSubject: Re: [junit] how to skip a test at runtime\n\n \n\nHi Vietchau --\n\nI have no further suggestions about the techniques to use to do this\n(I&#39;ve\ndone what David suggests when I needed such support)\n\nOn a different note though, my I ask about the following:\n\n&gt;&gt; I need to create unit tests for QA and they require an option to\nselect\nwhich test to run at runtime.\n\nI&#39;m curious about how (why?) &quot;QA&quot; is using JUnit tests.\n\nTypically (although certainly not by rule), JUnit tests are used more\nfor\n&quot;programmer tests&quot;, most often unit (or even &quot;object&quot;) tests. Is this\nthe\ncase for you?\n\nIf so, what value does your &quot;QA&quot; find from these types of tests?\nAdditionally, if so, might it be a risky idea to run only select tests\nas\nopposed to the collective suite?\n\nIf not, being new to JUnit, it might be advisable for you to consider\nutilizing JUnit for this purpose. (And, in this case, there is certainly\nplenty of info available on this mailing list and even more in more\nformal\nprint that would be of great value to you)\n\nJust food for thought.
