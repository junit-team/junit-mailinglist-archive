Since the test suite will be written in eclipse\n&gt; IDE, how will it test the actuall testServer class which is running\n&gt; in the live enviroment.\n\nI feel I need to point out that what you&#39;re describing is not a unit\ntest but more of a functional test. Unit tests test a single object or\na small group of objects collaborating together. Unit tests don&#39;t\ninvolve running the whole system.\n\nYes, it&#39;s a question of vocabulary but vocabulary is important.\n\nNow, on to your problem...\n\n\nOn 12/18/06, avinash anand &lt;avinash_anand@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;  There is a system which you install (a multi-box installation) Which\n&gt; has the ORB server as the parent one. Other servers are scattered\n&gt; over other machines. Now I write a test server and copy the binary\n&gt; of the test server in the BIN directory. With the help of Admin console\n&gt; I start my test server and perform various operation viz start the\n&gt; server, load configuration parameters. The actuall operation of\n&gt; server is totally dependent on other servers. When a request comes\n&gt; to this test server from say server1 it performs some operation e.g\n&gt; fetches some database records and then forward a responce to\n&gt; Server2. It is this ways the system operates.\n&gt;\n&gt; There is no way that this test server can be run independently.\n&gt; Neither there is any way to run this server from any IDE as all its\n&gt; inputs and behaviour are dependent on other servers and\n&gt; services which are Native code.\n\nWhy do you say that there is no way for the server to run\nindependently? Why cannot the server be deployed with a set of fake\nservers?\n\n\nLasse\n\n",
