Doug Lea, author of &quot;Concurrent\nProgramming in Java&quot;, says they still give him trouble.\n\nA few simplifications that might work for you:\n\n* Do everything in one thread (the Swing approach).\n* Immutable classes are always thread safe.\n* Classes not reachable from outside the current thread are always thread safe.\n\nFor everything else, you&#39;re on your own.  Try reading Concurrent\nProgramming in Java for a good overview of the issues involved.\n\nJohn Brewer\nJera Design\n\n",
