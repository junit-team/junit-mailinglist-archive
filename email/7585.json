If the object is that complex, then maybe it&#39;s really more than one object. I&#39;d need a concrete example to be sure.<br/>\n<br/>\nI always assume we&#39;re talking Programmer Tests here, and in that case, the files would rarely need to be that long or that complex.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; 2. Using data in a file means worrying about where the files are on the<br/>\n&gt;file system when executing the tests.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Use a relative offset from your project.home<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>&quot;project.home&quot;? You&#39;re assuming Ant, I guess. Ant is widely-accepted, but not universal... yet.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; 3. What if I need to execute the tests on a file system that doesn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt;understand &quot;g:/myCsvFiles&quot;? (Yes, there are solutions, but none as easy as<br/>\n&gt;not having to worry about it.)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;What if I need to compile the java on a file system that doesn&#39;t <br/>\n&gt;understand &quot;g:/myCsvFiles&quot;?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t understand your implied point here.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; 4. Tests that require the file system are slower.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Not much. And not at all if you&#39;re testing through changing/adding <br/>\n&gt;files and not by changing the code.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I agree &quot;not much&quot;, except when there are 1000 tests.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t understand the logic of the second sentence.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; 5. Cleaning up the file system is asynchronous (from what I can tell)<br/>\n&gt;and unreliable to do in tests that execute at a rate of dozens per second.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;If you have to clean up the file system, clean up at the end the <br/>\n&gt;run; use Ant to rmdir.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>When was the last time you tried this? When I did, tearDown() finished before the files were removed, then the next test&#39;s setUp() complained that files already existed. That&#39;s why I don&#39;t like to do it. If the Java File calls were synchronized with the underlying file system, then this wouldn&#39;t be a problem.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; Processing the data is separate from reading/writing the data. This<br/>\n&gt;implies two separate classes.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; <br/>\n&gt;&gt; csvDataProcessor.findDuplicates(new CsvFileReader(fileName));<br/>\n&gt;&gt; ...<br/>\n&gt;&gt; <br/>\n&gt;&gt; This is exactly how XSL transformers work: transforming XML and<br/>\n&gt;reading/writing XML are separate concerns.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;+1<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I assume you mean that I scored a point here. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nTake care.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nJ.
