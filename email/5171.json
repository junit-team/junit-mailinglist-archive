I&#39;ve been developing GUIs on a number of platforms for years,<br/>\n&gt; and I thought I was only doing very basic tool-oriented tasks, but I&#39;ve<br/>\n&gt; never done a gui that reduces to a single component with a single<br/>\n&gt; message.  Maybe I just don&#39;t establish the proper concepts in the gui,<br/>\n&gt; but I invariably have several things interacting.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>We may be talking at cross purposes and not understanding each other. Let&#39;s<br/>\nget specific. Imagine a Dialog with several test fields, labels, and buttons<br/>\n- just to be specific. There are several components that can generate events<br/>\nto the Mediator/Presenter/Façade or whatever we want to call it. The<br/>\nPresenter sends several messages to the Dialog through an interface.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; Yes, the right message gets sent to the Dialog, but the Dialog still<br/>\n&gt; doesn&#39;t show up.  Now what?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>There&#39;s an API call to make it appear - I&#39;ve been in C++/MFC land the last<br/>\nfew weeks so I forget what it is - setVisible(true)??? or something like<br/>\nthat.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo if the Presenter sends a show() message to the Dialog, and show() is<br/>\nimplemented with a setVisible(true), and you say it doesn&#39;t appear, what are<br/>\nyou going to do about it? I maintain that a unit test of the Dialog doesn&#39;t<br/>\ngive any better feedback than just looking at the thing - or in this case,<br/>\nlooking for the thing ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; In my experience, the design space between<br/>\n&gt; two components is where I find the most bugs; it&#39;s rarely either one or<br/>\n&gt; the other but usually the interaction of the two that causes the problem<br/>\n&gt; or unexpected behavior.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Sure - which is why I want to move the complexity to just one place where I<br/>\ncan test it.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nRobert Koss, Ph.D.     | Training, Mentoring, Contract Development<br/>\nSenior Consultant      | Object Oriented Design, C++, Java<br/>\nwww.objectmentor.com   | Extreme Programming</div>",
