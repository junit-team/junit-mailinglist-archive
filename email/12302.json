I connect to a data provider via an IP address. They have <br/>\nprovided an API which I implement, and get callbacks from them with <br/>\nthe data. I can create a mock of one of their classes - but since <br/>\nit&#39;s not hooked up to their IP, there&#39;s no data in it. <br/>\n<br/>\nI suppose I could decompile their class and put some data in it - but <br/>\nat that point, am I really testing my interaction with their classes -<br/>\n or with one of my own munging?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for any suggestions.</div>",
