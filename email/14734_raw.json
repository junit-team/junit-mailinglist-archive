First, I&#39;m confused about whether there&#39;s a typo,\n&gt; \n&gt; and the original message was supposed to say &quot;TestResult&quot; everywhere it \n&gt; says &quot;TestRunner&quot;.  \n\nYes, that was probably due to a transient brain failure of mine...\nPleace replace TestRunner with TestResult when reading the previous post.\n\n&gt; Second, I think you&#39;re best off with modifying the strategy from the \n&gt; previous link you give.  By design, you don&#39;t have access to the current\n&gt; TestResult or TestRunner within a TestCase.\n\nOK, thanks, I&#39;ll try that :) \n\n-- \nJohn\n\n&gt; \n&gt;     David Saff\n&gt; \n&gt; John H. E. wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Hi!\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I am a beginner JUnit user, and I am not able to find sufficient\n&gt; &gt; information in the Documentation on how to use the TestRunner class\n&gt; and\n&gt; &gt; access its methods.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; There are a few examples in\n&gt; &gt; http://junit.sourceforge.net/doc/cookbook/cookbook.htm, under &quot;Suite&quot;,\n&gt; but\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m still unsure how to use TestRunner.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; For example, (how) can I access the TestRunner&#39;s methods in the\n&gt; tearDown()\n&gt; &gt; method of a TestCase subclass? Say that I want to avoid deleting some\n&gt; &gt; generated output files if a test has failed (but delete them if the\n&gt; test\n&gt; &gt; is successful).\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The methods wasSuccessful(), failureCount() and errorCount() in\n&gt; &gt; junit.framework.TestResult look very convenient to use. Is this true?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I guess I could use some modified version of what is suggested in the\n&gt; &gt; thread http://groups.yahoo.com/group/junit/message/13151 (&quot;detect test\n&gt; &gt; failure in teardown()&quot;), but I want to know more about TestResult\n&gt; first...\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; -- \n&gt; &gt; John\n&gt; &gt;\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n______________________________________________________\nClick here to donate to the Hurricane Katrina relief effort.\nhttp://store.yahoo.com/redcross-donate3/\n\n\n\n\n",
