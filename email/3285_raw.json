(Maybe the suggestions in\n&gt; this thread will help me change that.)\n&gt;\n\nThere is usually an underlying mental assertion when using System.out, for\nexample.  You see the result and compare it mentally to an expected outcome.\nThis is important information for you and the next person to touch the code,\nso I suggest it&#39;s best codified by a test that lives beyond the debugging\nsession.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Moreover, logging debug messages at this granularity tends to\n&gt; &gt; reduce the\n&gt; &gt; readability of the code, in my experience.\n&gt;\n&gt; I agree. If you use debug output/log statements, they are there to\n&gt; perform a specific task: find a bug. Once located and exterminated,\n&gt; their function is over, take them out.\n&gt;\n\nThe OP suggested using debug logging and then turning them off, rather than\ntaking them out.  I agree that if used for debugging, they should be\nremoved.... and replaced by a test.\n\nFinding the bug is usually the most time-consuming step; fixing it usually\ntakes less time.  I have noticed that I usually can&#39;t stuff enough context\ninformation into debug messages as I&#39;d like, and this slows down my\ndebugging.  Rather, if I can capture that context in a test, it&#39;s easier to\nfind.\n\nSo, when I find myself wanting to use debug logging statements, I&#39;ll attempt\nto write a test instead to verify my assertions.  This isn&#39;t always easy, but\nmany times it leads to some well-deserved refactoring that I think make it\nworth it.  If I don&#39;t already have a good test suite, then it may take some\ntime to isolate the bug, but in the end this yields a more comprehensive set\nof tests.  I&#39;m still learning...\n\nMike\n\n--\nMike Clark\nClarkware Consulting, Inc.\nhttp://www.clarkware.com\n720.851.2014\n\n\n\n",
