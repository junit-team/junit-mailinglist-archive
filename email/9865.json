They are intended to be used within load tests<br/>\nbut you can use them anywhere. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe execution timer API is:<br/>\n<br/>\n// Start the timer.<br/>\nvoid start() <br/>\n<br/>\n// Return the current accumulated time in milliseconds. This does not<br/>\neffect the current accumulated time. long checkpoint() <br/>\n<br/>\n// Return the current accumulated time in milliseconds and cease<br/>\naccumulating time. long pause() <br/>\n<br/>\n// Resume accumulating time<br/>\nvoid resume()<br/>\n<br/>\n// Return the current accumulated time in milliseconds and cease<br/>\naccumulating time. <br/>\n// This simply calls pause(), however it is useful if your intention is<br/>\nto <br/>\n// communicate to the reader of the code that you are done timing. <br/>\nlong end() <br/>\n<br/>\n// Reset accumulated time to zero and cease accumulating additional time<br/>\nvoid reset() <br/>\n<br/>\n// Assert that the current execution time is outside of (greater than) a<br/>\nspecified <br/>\nvoid assertTimeOutsideOfBoundary(<br/>\n    String message, <br/>\n    long boundary)<br/>\n<br/>\n// Assert that the current execution time is within (less than or equal<br/>\nto) a specified boundary time void assertTimeWithinBoundary(<br/>\n    String message, <br/>\n    long boundary)<br/>\n<br/>\n// Assert that the current execution time is within specified start and<br/>\nend boundary times: // startBoundary &lt;= time &lt;= endBoundary void<br/>\nassertTimeWithinBounds(<br/>\n    String message, <br/>\n    long startBoundary, <br/>\n    long endBoundary)<br/>\n<br/>\n-----------------------------<br/>\nMike Silverstein<br/>\nSilverMark, Inc.<br/>\nThe Object Testing Company<br/>\nwww.javatesting.com<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Chad Woolley [mailto:lists@...] <br/>\n&gt; Sent: Thursday, November 13, 2003 1:10 PM<br/>\n&gt; To: junit@yahoogroups.com<br/>\n&gt; Subject: [junit] Re: performance testing<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; This is a situation where Aspect-Oriented Programming might be useful <br/>\n&gt; after all.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; This might be caused because the framework is doing some <br/>\n&gt; &quot;Other Stuff&quot; <br/>\n&gt; which is getting in the way of timing the actual execution <br/>\n&gt; time of the <br/>\n&gt; real work.  It may not be easy to extend the framework to get your <br/>\n&gt; numbers and still get &quot;close enough&quot; to the actual test <br/>\n&gt; execution to get <br/>\n&gt; meaningful numbers.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; It might turn out that the test fixture setup is obscuring the actual <br/>\n&gt; execution time of the tests.  FOr example, if the fixture setup takes <br/>\n&gt; much longer than the actual execution of the Class Under Test.  This <br/>\n&gt; would make it difficult to get meaningful numbers, since the <br/>\n&gt; variance in <br/>\n&gt; the fixture execution time would obscure the actual test performance <br/>\n&gt; numbers.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; In this situation, you could come up with some scheme to wrap the <br/>\n&gt; monitoring around the actual call to your Class Under Test, and avoid <br/>\n&gt; including your fixture setup in the monitoring.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; AOP could be well suited for this type of task, because otherwise you <br/>\n&gt; would have to duplicate this monitoring code (or at least remember to <br/>\n&gt; duplicate a call to it) in each test method.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Then again, there could be a way to accomplish the same thing <br/>\n&gt; with Plain <br/>\n&gt; Old Java.  Maybe by routing all calls to the Class Under Test <br/>\n&gt; through a <br/>\n&gt; monitoring method.  This could take the class name, method <br/>\n&gt; name, and any <br/>\n&gt; params, then use some fancy reflection to invoke the method <br/>\n&gt; and gather <br/>\n&gt; the elapsed time.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -- Chad<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Jim Dixon wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I haven&#39;t done very careful testing, but I certainly have <br/>\n&gt; noticed that <br/>\n&gt; &gt; the times reported by JUnit vary a great deal.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Running one simple set of tests just now gave me results in <br/>\n&gt; which 50% <br/>\n&gt; &gt; differences were common and more than one test took 3x as long from <br/>\n&gt; &gt; one run to the next.  So, sure, you can use JUnit for this sort of <br/>\n&gt; &gt; simple performance testing, but you should at least run the tests <br/>\n&gt; &gt; enough times to build statistical confidence in the results.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; It didn&#39;t show up in these few runs, but I believe that I <br/>\n&gt; have noticed <br/>\n&gt; &gt; before that the first test reported a much longer than <br/>\n&gt; normal time -- <br/>\n&gt; &gt; seconds rather than milliseconds.  So the order in which <br/>\n&gt; tests are run <br/>\n&gt; &gt; might introduce an effect large enough to render the <br/>\n&gt; results useless.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------ Yahoo!
