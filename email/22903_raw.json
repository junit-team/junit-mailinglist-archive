I&#39;ve another question about a test\n&gt; \n&gt; Let&#39;s say I have cod=\r\ne which executes two things and I want to have those things splitted up in =\r\ntwo methods. Method 2 however is also called from method 1.\n&gt; \n&gt; E.g. \n&gt; //=\r\n Contains it&#39;s name and contents (in ascii)\n&gt; FileObject fileObject;\n&gt; \n&gt; p=\r\nublic void loadFile(String strFile)\n&gt; {\n&gt;    File f =3D new File(strFile)\n&gt;=\r\n    if (f.exists)\n&gt;    {\n&gt;       String contents  =3D readFile(f);\n&gt;       =\r\nfileObject =3D new FileObject(name, contents);\n&gt;    }\n&gt; }\n&gt; \n&gt; public Strin=\r\ng readFile(File f)\n&gt; {\n&gt;    // do read stuff\n&gt;    return contents\n&gt; }\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\nMy question is now how do you junit test this code \n&gt; \n&gt; Do you first test =\r\n&quot;readFile&quot; and then write a test &quot;loadFile&quot; which will lead to the fact tha=\r\nt &quot;readFile&quot; is executed once again when you test &quot;loadFile&quot; \n&gt; \n&gt; Do you w=\r\nrite a test for &quot;loadFile&quot; and test the contents in this test method.\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\nBaiscally the question is about junit testing methods which call other meth=\r\nods ?\n&gt; \n&gt; Tnx in advance for the repsonses,\n&gt; Regards,\n&gt; Tom\n&gt;\n\n\n\n",
