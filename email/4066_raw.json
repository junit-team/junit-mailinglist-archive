However, I am getting problems\n&gt; running test suites as the order of execution does\n&gt; not appear to be constant. \n&gt; Tests are written in this order : \n&gt; testGetVehicle() \n&gt; testAddVehicle() \n&gt; testSaveVehicle() \n&gt; testDeleteVehicle() \n&gt; \n&gt; Overall flow is to retrieve an entity, modify it,\n&gt; then delete it. \n&gt; \n&gt; Tests appear to be executed in this order : \n&gt; testDeleteVehicle() \n&gt; testGetVehicle() \n&gt; testAddVehicle() \n&gt; testSaveVehicle() \n&gt; \n&gt; By running out of order the testDeleteVehicle()\n&gt; method cant find the modified entity, and fails its\n&gt; test. \n&gt; \n&gt; Using JBuilder 6, is this related to most recent\n&gt; changes and compilation ? JUnitEE itself appears to\n&gt; be working fine. Any pointers of where to look ? \n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks \n&gt; \n&gt; Scott \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ----------\n&gt; Get a free, personalised email address at\n&gt; http://another.com\n&gt; TXT ALRT!

Then have that test run the others.\n\nHowever...you might want to rethink how you are\ntesting.  I&#39;m sure someone else can say this better,\nbut the fact that order matters raises a red flag in\nmy mind.\n\n-Eric\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nSend FREE Valentine eCards with Yahoo!
