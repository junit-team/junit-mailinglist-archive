I suspect that<br/>\nthere is some form of resource hogging occurring within your code (either<br/>\ntest code, production code, or both) that is the real cause of the problem.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe setUp() & tearDown() methods that JUnit calls before & after each<br/>\ntestcase (method) is called, should be used where necessary to release<br/>\nresources. This will allow the GarbageCollector to free memory as needed,<br/>\nwithout you having to change the JVM&#39;s heap size.<br/>\n<br/>\nHTH<br/>\n<br/>\nAndrew<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: claudioillanes [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:claudioillanes@...\">claudioillanes@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: 13 May 2004 21:55<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: [junit] Making a large set of tests as efficient as possible<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hi there!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Just a quick question. I have  a suite that lines up about 25 test<br/>\n&gt; classes ( each containing say 10 test methods ) and I iterate for 300<br/>\n&gt; objects to add these tests to a suite. I would like to know any best<br/>\n&gt; practices to ensure I don&#39;t get any OutOfMemoryErrors. I changed the<br/>\n&gt; jvm tag to increase virtual memory to say 512 but, if I keep adding<br/>\n&gt; many tests to this suite, what would be the next item to ensure I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; doing. I am also setting TestCase member variables to null where<br/>\n&gt; possible. What would be the next step? The reason I ask is because I<br/>\n&gt; would like to push JUnit to the limit and have it test all day and<br/>\n&gt; night for a large application. Any help or comments would be<br/>\n&gt; appreciated. Even different design techniques are welcome.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Cheers!<br/>\n&gt; Claudio<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Yahoo!
