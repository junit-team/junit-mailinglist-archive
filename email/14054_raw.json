If you can get a subscription to that in Germany,\nI&#39;d recommend it.  They also have a lot of good system testing content\non their website: http://stickyminds.com.  \n \nFinally, don&#39;t underestimate the benefit of hiring a consulting for a\nmonth or two to help jump start your system test program.  I&#39;d recommend\nthat the consultant should be me and that the month or two should\ninclude Oktoberfest.

Thx!\n\t(I asked on softwaretestingexperts@yahoogroups, but this is more\nsort of a\n\tjob listing group).\n\t\n\t---------\n\t\n\tI am in an company with about 50 developers (+ management) which\nnow\n\twants/has to set up a system test group = probably 10..15 people\nwho do\n\tsystem testing (we have 10 &quot;country versions&quot; of our software\nand up to 3\n\tversions per country in the field, up to 3 versions &quot;in the\nmaking&quot;).\n\tI do know about \n\t\n\t* testing from a testers perspective (my favorite book:\nB.Beizer&#39;s &quot;Black\n\tBox Testing&quot;)\n\t\n\t* testing in the developer community (JUnit testing is done,\nalthough\n\thaphazardly, by about 50% of the developers; direct application\ntests are\n\tdone by many developers)\n\t\n\tbut I do NOT know much about &quot;higher level issues&quot; like\n\t\n\t* input quality level for system tests done by the system test\ngroup (how to\n\tdefine and ascertain it?)\n\t* management of the system test group\n\t* conflict resolution between development and system test group\n\t* and what else?\n\t\n\tIs there any literature out there (books, on the net, ...) that\ncould be\n\thelpful? (yes, I did a google, but up to now the results are\n&quot;quite mixed&quot;).\n\t\n\tAlso, anyone who has experience to share is very welcome!\n\t\n\tThank you!\n\tHarald M.
