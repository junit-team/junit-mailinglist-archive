Examples include open <br/>\n&gt;&gt;source applications or products where the source code is the primary <br/>\n&gt;&gt;deliverable (e.g. frameworks).<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I think that we are talking about two different products: the final application (a jar in the Java world) and the development environment.<br/>\n&gt; The tests code is part of the source code but not part of the final application.<br/>\n&gt; You always can keep the tests in the cvs tree or a separate package for download.  If the customer has the knowledge to modify the code, he certainly know how to get code from a cvs tree :-)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -Vladimir<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;m specifically referring to products where the source code is part and <br/>\nparcel of the product or the product provides a Java API.  It&#39;s not <br/>\nalways necessary to ship all of the test cases, but relevant test cases <br/>\nthat document and validate the use of the product should easily make up <br/>\nfor their storage and bandwidth penalties.<br/>\n<br/>\nMike<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nMike Clark<br/>\nClarkware Consulting, Inc.<br/>\nCustom Software Architecture, Design,<br/>\nDevelopment, and Performance Consulting<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.clarkware.com\">http://www.clarkware.com</a></div>",
