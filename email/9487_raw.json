But one of the subthreads in this discussion is that\n&gt;&gt; &gt; comments can be made unnecessary by, for example, appropriate choice\n&gt;&gt; &gt; of variable/method/class/etc names.  This is something that we all do, I\n&gt;&gt; &gt; imagine.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; But the longer and more meaningful the names, the slower the code ;-)\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; In what language is this true, and why?\n\n&gt; It&#39;s probably true in any interpreted language; it takes time to run\n&gt; through strings.  The longer the strings, the more time it takes.\n\nJim, I mean this in the nicest possible way: I think you need to run a\ntest.\n\nAll the interpreted languages I know use symbol tables. The references in\nthe byte code are resolved to indexes or pointers at compile time,\ngenerally not run time. In Java, in which I am not expert, my understanding\nis that the code that actually executes has been run through the jitter and\nconverted to actual machine code. I would expect all the symbol lookups, if\nthere were any, and if they were slow, to be resolved by then if not\nbefore.\n\n&gt; Also, Java is widely used in applications whose performance is\n&gt; dominated by communications.  If names are embedded in those\n&gt; communications, longer names mean slower communications means\n&gt; poorer performance.\n\nYes, that&#39;s true. If names were the bulk of the messages going back and\nforth, then longer could be slower. If, as is not uncommonly the case,\nwhat&#39;s going back and forth is mostly data -- web pages, movies, sound,\ndatabase records -- then the symbols in the queries and responses aren&#39;t\nlikely to be a big fraction of the data transmitted. Clearly this is\napplication dependent, and encoding dependent.\n\n&gt; This rule should not be true in compute-intensive applications --\n&gt; but the more compute-bound the problem, the less likely that Java\n&gt; is to be used.\n\nYes, but this is more a function of its interpretive nature than the length\nof the names, I would expect. And somewhere I believe I saw a case where C#\nbeat C++ on some benchmark. And I have seen Smalltalk beat C++ as well.\n\n&gt; In a month or two I might be able to come back with performance\n&gt; figures.\n\nI guess you&#39;re very busy. Perhaps a smaller experiment would be possible.\nMaybe someone else will do one. But the one that will convince you will be\none that you&#39;ll do.\n\n&gt; Elsewhere in this thread I have cited a CACM article that would seem\n&gt; to support this rule of thumb.\n\nYes. I&#39;ll check it out and report back if it&#39;s interesting ...\n\nRon Jeffries\nwww.XProgramming.com\nAnalysis kills spontaneity.\nThe grain once ground into flour germinates no more. --  Henri Amiel\n\n\n\n",
