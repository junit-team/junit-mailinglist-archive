For instance, until Eclipse adds <br/>\nsupport for JUnit4 we would have to add a suite() method to every new <br/>\ntest class in order for it to run in the Eclipse JUnitRunner.  With a <br/>\ngeneric decorator pattern it seems that it would be possible to <br/>\nautomatically detect that a test is a JUnit4 test (but not wrapped in a <br/>\nJUnit4TestAdapter) and proxy it for the old-style runner.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJason Rogers<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I,<br/>\nbut Christ liveth in me: and the life which I now live in <br/>\nthe flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved <br/>\nme, and gave himself for me.&quot;<br/>\n    Galatians 2:20</div>",
