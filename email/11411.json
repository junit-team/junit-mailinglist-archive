We are not verifying Count<br/>\n&gt; in this test, but rather indexing.  Although I would argue that it is<br/>\n&gt; nice to have pre-requisites satisfied in the middle of a test, to help<br/>\n&gt; direct your attention to the true cause of the issue.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I agree that verifying prerequisites is a good thing. I might, however, <br/>\ndo that either in SetUp or a separate test.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; An assumption is really a pre-requisite - that if fails, really means<br/>\n&gt; that you were not even able to set-up to do the real testing.  Having<br/>\n&gt; assumptions fail helps to pin-point coupling between components - as<br/>\n&gt; well as helps direct your attention was secondary failing tests to the<br/>\n&gt; primary ones (aka the failed Assertions).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; An corollary is something you believe to be true, but is not essential<br/>\n&gt; to your unit test itself.  Corollaries are nice because you indirectly<br/>\n&gt; add additional tests for other components of our system without that<br/>\n&gt; much extra overhead.  Failing corollaries may highlight obscure bugs<br/>\n&gt; in other parts of your system, or they highlight your<br/>\n&gt; mis-understanding of those other parts (or they highlight a change to<br/>\n&gt; the underlying assumptions of those parts).<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>These are very interesting ideas, and I like them, but I would like to <br/>\nventure something that I find simpler.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe name of the method and of its containing class provide the context <br/>\nfor what is being tested. It should be easy to identify the assertions <br/>\nin the test that match with the test&#39;s context. In this case, absolutely <br/>\neverything else is an assumption or corollary.<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJ. B.
