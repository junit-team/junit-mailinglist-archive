Glad that worked out, Vietchau.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn to the side discussion:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On 12/22/06, Cédric Beust ♔ &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:cbeust@...\">cbeust@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Here&#39;s the code sample.  The code for OneInstance was in my last<br/>\n&gt; &gt; e-mail.  Only one instance of HumongousDataStructure is constructed.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Yes, and you are still using a static variable for this example:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; public class ConstructOnceTest {<br/>\n&gt;         public static class HumongousDataStructure {<br/>\n&gt;                 static int numConstructed = 0;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; How would you do this without a static?<br/>\n<br/>\nGood grief!  (To use a seasonal phrase)<br/>\n<br/>\nI actually considered putting in a disclaimer before the original code<br/>\nsample, but I thought it was redundant.  The point is this line:<br/>\n<br/>\nprivate HumongousDataStructure thisTakesAReallyLongTimeToConstruct =<br/>\nnew HumongousDataStructure();<br/>\n<br/>\nHere, our HumongousDataStructure is declared as an instance field, and<br/>\nis only constructed once.  I thought this was what we were talking<br/>\nabout.<br/>\n<br/>\nnumConstructed, on the other hand, is being used to &quot;test the test&quot;.<br/>\nIt is a static variable because I wanted to find out how many<br/>\nHumongousDataStructures were constructed globally.  Do you have a<br/>\nfavorite, clear way to do this without using a static variable?<br/>\n<br/>\nI fear that if this discussion is left to rhetorical flourishes, I am<br/>\nwithout the ammo and desire to prevail.  Let&#39;s get down to declarative<br/>\nstatements.<br/>\n<br/>\nCedric, I believe that using the @RunWith(OneInstance.class)<br/>\nannotation, any JUnit test class will be run in such a way that only<br/>\none instance of the class is constructed for all methods invoked, and<br/>\ntherefore, each instance field will be assigned only once.  Do you<br/>\nbelieve that I am mistaken?<br/>\n<br/>\n   David Saff </span></blockquote></div>",
