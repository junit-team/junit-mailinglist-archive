My feeling is that it is the *later* as I attended a presentation on\ndeveloper testing by Jeff from Agitar and there was very little talk of the\ntool.  Possibly the misunderstanding came from local marketing and local\ninexperience?\n\nWhenever we have been discussing developer testing here I get the impression\nthat some think the tool will solve the problems for them ... it will do the\n&#39;&quot;testing&quot;.  I (and others) have been reiterating that developer testing is\nan attitude and usually requires a change in culture more than a change in\ntoolset.\n\nRegards\nShane\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n",
