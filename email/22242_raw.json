Isn&#39;t removing tedium why we have \n&gt; computers in the first place?\n=\r\n\nAs far as I know, coverage tools deal well with direct dependencies\nbut no=\r\nt with logical (interpretive) dependency.\n\nFor example, if we have\n\n  Test =\r\nA --&gt; SUT A --&gt; SUT B\n  Test B --&gt; SUT B\n\nEven in this simple case, coverag=\r\ne analysis won&#39;t tell us anything \nabout the relationship between A and B, =\r\nalthough we could make some\ndeductions by examining the results.\n\nIf there =\r\nwere some way to tell the framework &quot;Test A depends\non functionality, which=\r\n is tested directly by B&quot; then I can\nimagine several good outcomes:\n\n1) The=\r\n test result output could be made much clearer - by\nemphasizing the B resul=\r\nt when both tests had failed. Some\napproaches I can think include subordina=\r\nting the A result \nto that of B, highlighting B, not showing A at all and\nm=\r\narking A as inconclusive.\n\n2) Users would be discouraged from seeking annot=\r\nations that\nprovide for direct ordering of tests or the actual &quot;hard&quot;\ndepen=\r\ndencies.\n\n3) Less important, but as an optimization, the framework\ncould su=\r\nppress running of A if B had already failed.\n\nCharlie\n\n&gt; Kent\n&gt; \n&gt; On Dec 2=\r\n9, 2009, at 2:28 PM, Pigneri, Rocco wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Charlie,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;As a f=\r\nramework author, I can see that allowing the user to specify \n&gt; &gt; &gt;ordering=\r\n is a simpler implementation. But I think it&#39;s more \n&gt; &gt; &gt;interesting to im=\r\nagine the user specifying the nature of the \n&gt; &gt; &gt;dependencies and allowing=\r\n the framework to figure out a strategy.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I am very much with you o=\r\nn this one. In my experience, \n&gt; there have been a lot of times when functi=\r\nons under test \n&gt; within the same class depend upon each other, and it woul=\r\nd \n&gt; have been great to have the test harness know that \n&gt; information. Whe=\r\nn I was refactoring code for a new framework \n&gt; package, I would have loved=\r\n to have the UI to display \n&gt; non-dependent tests first as it would have sh=\r\nown me very \n&gt; clearly the source of the problem.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Specifying only =\r\nthe relationships in code and leaving the \n&gt; display strategy to the test h=\r\narness would allow more \n&gt; flexible display and execution of these tests ba=\r\nsed upon the \n&gt; user&#39;s goals rather than upon the dependencies themselves. =\r\nI \n&gt; could imagine myself asking the UI only to display the least \n&gt; depend=\r\nent functions&#39; errors and to hide all other errors for \n&gt; quick debugging o=\r\nn sweeping optimizations. I could also want \n&gt; to see the dependent tests i=\r\nn a tree in case I am changing a \n&gt; single class and want to understand the=\r\n effects of what I am \n&gt; touching. I could also want to see all tests in a =\r\nsingle list \n&gt; with the least dependent at the top and the most dependent o=\r\nn \n&gt; the bottom when running regression tests. As you can see, the \n&gt; chose=\r\nn view depends more upon what I am doing than upon the \n&gt; test dependencies=\r\n themselves.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Finally, being able to list dependencies between test=\r\n \n&gt; classes in addition to test cases would also JUnit to report \n&gt; which c=\r\nomponents of the system depend upon each other. This \n&gt; simple extension wo=\r\nuld greatly increase the power of the \n&gt; dependency models for larger syste=\r\nms (particularly regression tests).\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Thank you,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Rocco\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; From: junit@yahoogroups.com [mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com] \n&gt; On Behal=\r\nf \n&gt; &gt; Of Charlie Poole\n&gt; &gt; Sent: Thursday, December 24, 2009 12:09 AM\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nTo: junit@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; &gt; Subject: RE: [junit] Order of execution for t=\r\nests\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Hi C=E9dric,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; On another list, I identified the s=\r\name variations of dependency \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; but with the variation that for case =\r\n1. We might run B \n&gt; anyway but \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; could highlight the error in A in =\r\nsome way. That \n&gt; approach doesn&#39;t \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; require ordering the tests in a=\r\nny particular way, which \n&gt; has some advantages.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It still promotes =\r\ndeveloper efficiency while not worrying about \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; execution efficiency=\r\n.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Yes, we call these &quot;soft dependencies&quot;.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I=\r\nf &quot;b&quot; has a hard dependency on &quot;a&quot; and &quot;a&quot; fails, &quot;a&quot; will be \n&gt; &gt; &gt; marked=\r\n &quot;FAILED&quot; and b &quot;SKIPPED&quot;.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; If &quot;b&quot; has a soft dependency on &quot;a&quot;,=\r\n &quot;b&quot; will still run \n&gt; even if &quot;a&quot; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; fails but a warning could be disp=\r\nlayed in the log.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; This is an implementation-based view of the test=\r\ns: i.e. they will \n&gt; &gt; either be run or not run.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The distinction I=\r\n was trying to make - and I think David as \n&gt; well - is \n&gt; &gt; based on the c=\r\nause and nature of the dependency.\n&gt; &gt; For the sake of argument, I&#39;ll try t=\r\no redefine what you&#39;re calling \n&gt; &gt; Hard and Soft along those lines.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; Hard: Test A does something (sets state) upon which B depends.\n&gt; &gt; For e=\r\nxample, A may write to a data store and B might try to \n&gt; read the \n&gt; &gt; inf=\r\normation back. Or A might create a complex object and B \n&gt; might try \n&gt; &gt; t=\r\no call a method on that object. If we allow this sort of \n&gt; thing, then \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; there is no choice but to run A first and it makes sense to \n&gt; not run B =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; at all if A fails. However, I would not want a unit test \n&gt; framework =\r\nto \n&gt; &gt; allow it.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Soft: Test A tests some functionality upon which=\r\n some other \n&gt; &gt; functionality, tested by B, depends. Therefore, if test A =\r\n\n&gt; fails, Test \n&gt; &gt; B will either fail as well or be inconclusive, so nothi=\r\nng \n&gt; further can \n&gt; &gt; be learned from test B. In this case, a testing fram=\r\nework could \n&gt; &gt; respond in a number of ways to the dependency:\n&gt; &gt; 1) Run =\r\nthe tests in order, skipping B if A fails.\n&gt; &gt; 2) Run the tests in an arbit=\r\nrary order, but skip B if A already ran \n&gt; &gt; and failed.\n&gt; &gt; 3) Run the tes=\r\nts in an arbitrary order, not skipping any of \n&gt; them but \n&gt; &gt; organize rep=\r\norting in such a way that a failure of A takes \n&gt; precedence \n&gt; &gt; over a fa=\r\nilure of B.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; As a framework author, I can see that allowing the use=\r\nr to specify \n&gt; &gt; ordering is a simpler implementation. But I think it&#39;s mo=\r\nre \n&gt; &gt; interesting to imagine the user specifying the nature of the \n&gt; &gt; d=\r\nependencies and allowing the framework to figure out a strategy.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; C=\r\nharlie\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Every time we have discussed this potential feature for \n=\r\n&gt; TestNG, the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; discussion ended up being non conclusive on the real i=\r\nnterest and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; the existing ability to mark certain methods as \n&gt; &quot;alwa=\r\nysRun&quot; already \n&gt; &gt; &gt; fills a big part of this scenario, so I always ended =\r\nup \n&gt; punting on \n&gt; &gt; &gt; it, but I&#39;d be happy to hear if someone can come up=\r\n with \n&gt; a good use \n&gt; &gt; &gt; case for soft dependencies...\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; --\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; ***C=E9dric\n&gt; &gt; &gt; *\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; [Non-text portions of this message=\r\n have been removed]\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; -------------------------------=\r\n-----\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Yahoo!
