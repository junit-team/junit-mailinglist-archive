How do I JUnit and,\n&gt; especially, TDD this?\n\nI&#39;m not familiar with the framework, but it appears that you&#39;re \nimplementating a class that will be invoked by the Doclet framework.\n\nNow fortunately, RootDoc is an interface, so we ought to be able to mock \nit, or provide a simple implementation of it, to pass in to the method \nstart(), which I /assume/ you&#39;re trying to test-drive.\n\nI would start with a few learning tests to discover what a RootDoc looks \nlike for a real-life set of Javadocs. Then I would use that information \nto understand how to simulate the methods of RootDoc. That would give me \nenough information to start test-driving start().\n\nI know this isn&#39;t particularly satisfying, but it&#39;s what I would do if I \nwere you. At least you have a pair partner to work with!\n-- \nJ. B.
