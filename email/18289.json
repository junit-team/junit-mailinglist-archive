I guess<br/>\n&gt; &gt; you could code in all the skeleton of the class, with the methods &<br/>\n&gt; &gt; such (though this won&#39;t compile unless you really do return what you<br/>\n&gt; &gt; say you will), then write the tests, then add the rest of the code.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; But I don&#39;t see the great advantage of that, to be honest...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I write the test, then use Eclipse to generate classes, interfaces and<br/>\n&gt; method stubs as I go.

There is a fundamental rule of TDD<br/>\nto write one and only one failing test at a time and make that pass<br/>\nbefore moving on to the next test.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is very important because it will encourage you to constantly<br/>\nrefactor, enabling your brain to evolve a much cleaner overall design as<br/>\nyou go.  In addition, this tends to make the task of &quot;getting the test<br/>\nto compile&quot; much less tedious, as you will need to add at the very most<br/>\nonly a single class and a single method.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope that helps.<br/>\n   -- MB<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",
