B. Rainsberger &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jbr@...\">jbr@...</a>&gt; <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Tuesday, January 14, 2003 10:44 PM<br/>\n  Subject: [junit] Re: Unit testing plugins<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Unit testing code that runs in a framework is not difficult, but it <br/>\n  can be annoying. This really merits an article, but here are the <br/>\n  bullet points.<br/>\n<br/>\n  1. Identify the extension points where you write your code.<br/>\n  2. In the extension points, identify the objects that you or the <br/>\n  framework use when executing your code.<br/>\n  3. Change your code to accept those objects as parameters, either to <br/>\n  a constructor or its methods.<br/>\n  4. Test the new code and either trust that the &quot;glue code&quot; will work <br/>\n  or refactor the glue code so that it is written only once. (Then you <br/>\n  can test it once.)<br/>\n<br/>\n  For example, in Struts, you code an Action class by <br/>\n  overriding &quot;execute()&quot;. Your code accesses your model and decides <br/>\n  which page to return as a response. Action.execute() takes <br/>\n  parameters to represent the Action list, an input form, the servlet <br/>\n  request and the servlet response. Typically, you will grab data from <br/>\n  the input form, set attributes on the request and specify the page <br/>\n  to forward to by name (a String).<br/>\n<br/>\n  Therefore, I write a method like this:<br/>\n<br/>\n  String doExecute(final MyModel model, final MyForm form, final Map <br/>\n  attributes) throws Exception {<br/>\n      // grab form parameters from &#39;form&#39;<br/>\n      // talk to the model<br/>\n      // add attributes to &#39;attributes&#39;<br/>\n      // return the name of the page to forward to (the &quot;forward name&quot;)<br/>\n  }<br/>\n<br/>\n  I can easily create or mock MyModel and MyForm as well as the Map of <br/>\n  attributes. I can easily check that the resulting forward name is <br/>\n  correct. I unit test this method as much as possible. Then I write:<br/>\n<br/>\n  ActionForward execute(final ActionMapping actionMapping, final <br/>\n  ActionForm form, final HttpServletRequest request, final <br/>\n  HttpServletResponse response) throws Exception {<br/>\n      final MyForm myForm = (MyForm) form;<br/>\n      final MyModel model = new MyModel();    // or retrieve from some <br/>\n  factory or creation method<br/>\n      final Map attributes = new HashMap();<br/>\n      <br/>\n      final String forwardName = doExecute(myForm, model, attributes);<br/>\n      setRequestAttributes(request, attributes);<br/>\n      return actionMapping.findForward(forwardName);<br/>\n  }<br/>\n<br/>\n  The method setRequestAttributes simply iterates over the map entries <br/>\n  and calls request.setAttribute for each one.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Notice that the glue code is quite boilerplate in nature. I could <br/>\n  even generate it or write it using funky reflection. This is a great <br/>\n  way to remove duplication.<br/>\n<br/>\n  If I find that I need more stuff in my doExecute() method, like <br/>\n  another part of the request, I can create a narrow <br/>\n  interface &quot;RequestProperties&quot; and pass that in to &#39;doExecute&#39;. In <br/>\n  the test code, I fake out the RequestProperties; in the production <br/>\n  code, I wrap the Request in another object that implements <br/>\n  RequestProperties. The goal is to improve substitutability of <br/>\n  implementation to maximize ease of testing.<br/>\n<br/>\n  What do you think?<br/>\n<br/>\n  --JBR.<br/>\n<br/>\n  --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;kazugt_2000 &lt;pgeorge@a...&gt;&quot; <br/>\n  &lt;pgeorge@a...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n  &gt; Hi all,<br/>\n  &gt; <br/>\n  &gt; I am relatively new to Junit.
