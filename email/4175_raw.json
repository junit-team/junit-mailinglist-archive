I am not against this (in fact I prefer it),\nbut often a few words of English (or whatever language you read) is\npreferrable (IMHO) to a large test suite.\nI still have the test suite, however, for refactoring and code proof.\n\nI would still say that that the tests document examples of the intention,\nrather than the intention itself. These examples may be a complete set or\nmay not be, often just the critical subset.\n\ncheers\njoe\n\nThis e-mail and any attachment is for authorised use by the intended recipient(s) only.
