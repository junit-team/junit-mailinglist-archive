For example,\nyou can have &quot;database&quot; tests, &quot;front=\r\n-end&quot; tests, &quot;security&quot; tests, etc...\n\nThis kind of grouping is functional,=\r\n but you can also have a more procedural\ngrouping:  &quot;check-in&quot; tests (the t=\r\nests that need to be run before any\nsubmission to the depot), &quot;functional&quot; =\r\ntests (which cover our entire\napplication&quot;, &quot;integration&quot; tests (making sur=\r\ne all the various parts work\nwell together), etc...\n\nObviously, one test ca=\r\nn belong to several tests.\n\nThe only way you can group tests with JUnit is =\r\n-- like the &quot;test&quot; hack -- by\nusing Java features:  class and package names=\r\n.\n\nIt was good enough back then because there was no choice, but we can do =\r\nmuch\nbetter now with annotations:\n\n@Test(groups =3D { &quot;check-in&quot;, &quot;function=\r\nal&quot;, &quot;database&quot; })\npublic void verifyAddressRecords() {\n  ...\n}\n\nNotice how=\r\n orthogonal your business logic is (method name and code) with how\nthis met=\r\nhod will be interpreted with the test framework.  There is no\ninterference:=\r\n it&#39;s totally non-intrusive.\n\nOnce you have that, it becomes trivial to det=\r\nach the static model (your test\ncode) from your runtime model (which tests =\r\nto run) and it becomes much\neasier to implement Ilja&#39;s suggestion:  &quot;don&#39;t =\r\nalways run them all&quot;.\n\nIf you have just modified some database-related code=\r\n, you then need to\n\n- Run all the &quot;check-in&quot; tests (mandatory for everyone)=\r\n\n- Run the &quot;database&quot; group (just to make sure)\n\n\n-- \nC=E9dric\nhttp://beust=\r\n.com/testng\n\n\n\n",
