So, I threw caution to the wind and submitted not only<br/>\nmethods that did X, but unit tests to ensure that the method really did do<br/>\nmy best understanding of X.<br/>\n<br/>\nTwo of my three previous employers had zero unit tests in-house when I<br/>\nstepped through the door. In both of them, I wrote the first tests and<br/>\nstarted trying to share the vision of tested code being somewhere that bugs<br/>\ncan&#39;t hide. It&#39;s hard work.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnit testing should be a &quot;no-brainer&quot;, but I find that it&#39;s still treated<br/>\npoorly within corporations.<br/>\n<br/>\nSimon<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Wed, May 5, 2010 at 6:25 PM, Bradley, Todd &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:todd.bradley@...\">todd.bradley@...</a>&gt;wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Mike, this is such a great topic you&#39;ve stumbled on. Where I work, we are<br/>\n&gt; doing lots of hiring this year. Every development engineer candidate that<br/>\n&gt; comes in gets to do at least two programming problems on the board. For one<br/>\n&gt; of the problems, the question is something like, &quot;Write a function in any<br/>\n&gt; language you want (except Perl) to do XXX.&quot; And then once they have that, we<br/>\n&gt; ask them to tell us how they&#39;d unit test what they just wrote.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; It&#39;s a rare individual that says, &quot;Damn, now I realize I should have<br/>\n&gt; written the unit test FIRST!&quot; And out of probably 100 candidates in the past<br/>\n&gt; few years of this approach, not a single candidate has ever actually written<br/>\n&gt; a JUnit/NUnit/whatever test case first. But I hold out hope that person will<br/>\n&gt; someday grace our interview room.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Cheers,<br/>\n&gt; Todd.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a> &lt;junit%40yahoogroups.com&gt; [mailto:<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a> &lt;junit%40yahoogroups.com&gt;] On Behalf Of Mike<br/>\n&gt; Forsberg<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Monday, May 03, 2010 10:24 AM<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a> &lt;junit%40yahoogroups.com&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: [junit] When it matters most, don&#39;t forget your tests.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thank you to all those that responded.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I agree that if a candidate spends all their time on the simple error cases<br/>\n&gt; then they don&#39;t understand TDD.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I think a pair programming environment would be ideal for an interview.<br/>\n&gt; Maybe actually have the candidate solve an actual problem you&#39;re solving.<br/>\n&gt; This may sound like it may take a lot of time, but I&#39;d rather be part of a<br/>\n&gt; team that can spend 1-2 hours writing code in an interview, then waste that<br/>\n&gt; time on soft silks. If the candidate complains that it&#39;s not their<br/>\n&gt; IDE/editor of choice, that should send up a flag. Granted this is my ideal<br/>\n&gt; environment.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; What about a 2 stage interview? One where they write the tests for a<br/>\n&gt; already<br/>\n&gt; existing piece of code (maybe to increase the codes functionality), then<br/>\n&gt; another where they try and write code to get the tests to pass. Granted<br/>\n&gt; this is not testing if they actually use TDD, but it would show if they<br/>\n&gt; have<br/>\n&gt; the skill. Maybe forcing the iteration process of test -&gt; functionality -&gt;<br/>\n&gt; test -&gt; functionality will show if they have the skill.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I think spending some time, 2-3 hours with a machine, later in the<br/>\n&gt; interview<br/>\n&gt; process, say after a phone screen, maybe second round of face to face,<br/>\n&gt; might<br/>\n&gt; pay dividends in the quality of people on a team. Then again it might<br/>\n&gt; depend on how skilled you need this individual to be.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thanks for the input,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Big Mike<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Yahoo!
