We \nduplicate much code in the other two test methods.\n\nWe write such tests for every domain object so I wonder if we should \nimprove our test class.\n\nWould you write 3 or just 1 test method for that example?\n\nAnd would you try to convince senior coworkers who know little about \nJUnit and dislike TDD?\n\n\n",
