GWT\n&gt;  &gt; translates Java to JavaScript, and the source files (or class files)\n&gt;  &gt; must correpsond to JDK 1.4.2 or earlier. Given this, it seems that\n&gt;  &gt; JUnit 4.x is compiled with JDK 5+. Is there a way I can re-compile\n&gt;  &gt; JUnit 4.x (safely), and still be able to use it (and all its\n&gt;  &gt; features, like Hamcrest) with JDK 1.4.2 (except for annotations...)?\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; Regards,\n&gt;  &gt; Will\n&gt;  &gt;\n\nI&#39;m not sure what you mean about GWT - I use it on Java 5 and it works\nfine. GWT 1.4 doesn&#39;t work with Java 5 features like generics though.\nHave you tried compiling with a Java 5 JDK and seeing whether it works\nfor you?\n\nOther options - I don&#39;t know how successful people have been using\nretroweaver and similar tools in this situation.\n\nI&#39;ve used JMock , with the JUnit 3 integration when I was stuck on\nJava 1.4. I think this included some Hamcrest functionality, but it&#39;s\nquite verbose without Java 5 language features. You may be able to use\na subset of the full functionality in Hamcrest to do what you need?\n\nHopefully these suggestions will be of some use; sorry I can&#39;t be of more help.\n\nCheers,\n\nJames\n\n",
