(I think I recall these issues rela=\r\nted\nto the @Expected annotation, but it has been a while and quite a few\nre=\r\nvisions of both systems..)\n\nFor those who are unaware, I believe that the s=\r\nystem generating the xml\nunder discussion is currently being produced by a =\r\nspecific formatter in the\nJUnit task in Ant.  Yes, it is very common to use=\r\n this formatter, as many CI\ntools consume it as input for test status.\n\nhtt=\r\np://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/ant/core/trunk/src/main/org/apache/tools/ant/t=\r\naskdefs/optional/junit/XMLJUnitResultFormatter.java\n\nMy questions are these=\r\n, is JUnit responsible for this specification?  Or is\nthis a request for so=\r\nme JUnit mailing list follower&#39;s input into the\nprocess?\n\nOn Thu, Sep 16, 2=\r\n010 at 4:24 PM, Daniela Waranie &lt;typo3-community@...&gt;wrote:\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi,\n&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; the &quot;junit result format&quot; introduced by the ant project is a defacto\n&gt; s=\r\ntandard to exchange test result data between test runners and build\n&gt; serve=\r\nrs / IDE - not limited to java. Today it is used in many other\n&gt; programmin=\r\ng languages (e.g. PHPUnit, etc.). The same is true for ant,\n&gt; which is not =\r\nlimited for using in a specific programming language, too.\n&gt;\n&gt; I saw a lot =\r\nof discussions in the past years on how to extend the &quot;old\n&gt; xml&quot; to fit th=\r\ne current needs at the ant wiki:\n&gt; http://wiki.apache.org/ant/Proposals/Enh=\r\nancedTestReports\n&gt;\n&gt; I think it is time to start the evolution of the &quot;juni=\r\nt result format&quot;\n&gt; to came up with its ubliquitously. I think the &quot;next ver=\r\nsion&quot; of the\n&gt; &quot;junit result format specification&quot; should focus to be langu=\r\nage generic\n&gt; to full fill its current role.\n&gt;\n&gt; The above wiki page should=\r\n be splitted in things related to:\n&gt; 1) the xml evolution\n&gt; 2) the test run=\r\nner*\n&gt; 3) the test result xml printer*\n&gt; 4) the result xml consumer (IDEs, =\r\nbuild servers)\n&gt;\n&gt; *=3Dof the unit test framework used for your favorit pro=\r\ngramming language\n&gt;\n&gt; Essential to have success on the big goal we should n=\r\not try to create a\n&gt; complete new format. It must have a backward compatibi=\r\nlity, which leads\n&gt; into extending the current version (add elements and at=\r\ntributes, but not\n&gt; removing old ones). At the moment there is no official =\r\nDTD/Schema\n&gt; available for validation, so it is supposable that most apps a=\r\nre\n&gt; tolarant to new xml elements.\n&gt;\n&gt; Some goals outlined in the above pro=\r\nposials can not\n&gt; be reached that way (e.g. be streamable) - but going this=\r\n way makes the\n&gt; software industry able to perform a soft migration to the =\r\nnew format. I\n&gt; personally would like to see a xml element (e.g. &quot;notice&quot;) =\r\nfor skipped\n&gt; or incompleted (not jet fully implemented) test, which are in=\r\n fact not\n&gt; &quot;errors&quot; and not &quot;failure&quot;(s).\n&gt;\n&gt; What do you thing about the =\r\nevolution?\n&gt;\n&gt; Best regards\n&gt; Daniela Waranie\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\n\n[Non-text portions =\r\nof this message have been removed]\n\n\n",
