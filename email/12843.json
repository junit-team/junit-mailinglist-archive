To test methods that only modify private fields like you<br/>\n&gt; describe, you can use reflection (which I would personally prefer).  Use<br/>\n&gt; the object&#39;s getClass() method then Class&#39;s getField() method.  Field<br/>\n&gt; extends java.lang.reflect.AccessibleObject which has a<br/>\n&gt; setAccessible(boolean) method you can use to gain access to a private<br/>\n&gt; field through reflection.  Field has getter methods for its value.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; A security manager can be set up to prevent this bypassing of the<br/>\n&gt; private restriction, but by default you are allowed to do it.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You prefer jumping through all those hoops to just adding a method?
