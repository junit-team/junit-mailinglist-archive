I would like an \n&gt; error/failure in testMoneyEquals() to show *first* in the output. How to \n&gt; implement this? The test writer could somehow specify a &quot;level&quot; for each \n&gt; test (basic, mid, complex). That could be totally optionnal and thus not \n&gt; change the current API. That would be *just a hint* from the test writer to \n&gt; the person running the tests saying &quot;hey, look there first&quot;.\n \nI&#39;ve been relying upon the undocumented behavior in JUnit&#39;s reflection support.\nReflection seems to return methods based on their order within the class file,\nand JUnit&#39;s Result stores failures in a vector.  Vector&#39;s elements() method\nis documented as returning the contents in vector order.\n\nSo, basically, I write my tests in order, simplest first, most complex last,\nand it comes out in the right order if I use have JUnit use reflection to\nidentify the test methods.\n\nNaturally, if Kent or Erich change the Result class, I&#39;m hosed.\n\nIf you wanted to do this &quot;right&quot;, you could extend TestRunner and replace\nprintFailures() with a version which sorts the enumeration based on whatever\ncriteria you like.  Method name comes to mind as something easy to use.\n\n&gt; Personnally I&#39;m not even sure it&#39;s worth it, but I wanted to share that idea \n&gt; with people on the list.\n \nOh, I think it&#39;s worth it.  The last time I brought it up I got flamed. :p\nI hope you fare better than I did.\n\n-- \nJoi Ellis                    Software Engineer\nAravox Technologies          joi@..., gyles19@...\n\nNo matter what we think of Linux versus FreeBSD, etc., the one thing I\nreally like about Linux is that it has Microsoft worried.  Anything\nthat kicks a monopoly in the pants has got to be good for something.\n           - Chris Johnson\n\n\n",
