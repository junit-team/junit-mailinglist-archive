    "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-638170297\">Thanks for the response...just to summarize for anyone else with this <br/>\nproblem:<br/>\n<br/>\nI wanted a way to run an automated unit test that verifies that a <br/>\nreport has the correct layout, format, etc.  There are already tests <br/>\nto verify that the correct data is available, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe solution is to run the report manually with a set of known test <br/>\ndata to get a known output.  This is then hand-checked to make sure <br/>\nits good.  This is being referred to as the &quot;Golden Master&quot; technique.<br/>\n<br/>\nI then write a test that generates the report using the same test <br/>\ndata, and then assert that the generated output is the same as the <br/>\ngolden master.  For me, this means a byte level comparison of the <br/>\ngenerated PDF file, which works just fine.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is really a &quot;change detector&quot; style of test that lets me know <br/>\nwhen my output format changes.  When I actually want it to change, <br/>\nits just a matter of recreating the &quot;golden master&quot; report again.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy would I bother doing this?  So we can change the code base, <br/>\nconfigurations, etc., without worrying that there&#39;s an accidental <br/>\neffect on the final reports.   <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;J.
