Enough said, but I want to say more.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe answer to the question &quot;Test Driven Design&quot; (#4387) is laughably <br/>\nwrong. It might suffice for a beginner practitioner, but otherwise it&#39;s <br/>\nwoefully inadequate.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe answer to question #4383 (throwing exceptions) is absurd, since <br/>\nthere&#39;s no indication which conditions of the call to doOperation() <br/>\nmight throw which exception. The explanation is one person&#39;s opinion, <br/>\nand misses the point:<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;The only way to test properly that certain exceptions have been thrown <br/>\nis using variables. When more than one exception may be thrown, then it <br/>\nbecomes hard to understand the code if it simple says &#39;fail&#39;.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is only true if you&#39;re trying to test for different expected <br/>\nexceptions in the same test. Who the hell does that?!<br/>\n<br/>\nIt doesn&#39;t serve the community to project oneself as authoritative when <br/>\nthere is obvious literature out there that contradicts the answers to <br/>\nthis questions. For such a quiz, stick to answers that can be verified <br/>\nby running code and leave the opinion stuff out.<br/>\n<br/>\nTake care.<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJ. B.
