Just\n&gt; not sure how we can know when code in an api (subproject?) will break\n&gt; the dependent projects.\n\nI would probably have a set of acceptance tests (in the classical sense, \nnot the XP sense) in Project 1 that checks the key parts of APIProject \nthat Project 1 uses. Run those tests as part of Project 1&#39;s regular \nbuild. This way, if APIProject fails in a way that Project 1 cares \nabout, you&#39;ll know.\n\nOf course, even better would be for APIProject to have a separate \nrelease schedule so that Project 1 can do some checking before it \nupgrades its version of APIProject. This way, those tests need not be \npart of every Project 1 build.\n\nDo either of these suggestions help you?\n-- \nJ. B.
