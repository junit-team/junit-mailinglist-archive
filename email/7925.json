It is possible to have 100% line <br/>\ncoverage and still have a defect because you have not written code <br/>\nto handle a particular case.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; I do not like test coverage measurement.

My opinion.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; Take care.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I have no real practical interest in this. It is theoretical <br/>\ncuriosity.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou are right with the 100% objection. I meant a measure which <br/>\ncovers everything. If all tests are written to the results of that <br/>\nmeasure and the tests are all green then I think it is proven that <br/>\nthere are no bugs in the code (if the test has no bugs itself).<br/>\n<br/>\nThats what I am looking for. The super duper measure.<br/>\n<br/>\nAny idea?</div>",
