Its more like a framework for automating/categorizing \ntests but depends on plugins. i.e., it is as powerful as the plugins \navailable for it. Anyone who has any interesting suggestion or approach \non how to go about testing UI?\n\nI would love to hear comments on Jameleon as well.\n\nThanks\nPriyank\n\n\n\n",
