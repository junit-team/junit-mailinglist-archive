Log a feature request with IntelliJ, and<br/>\n&gt;&gt; mention that we&#39;d be happy to talk to them if they don&#39;t find what<br/>\n&gt;&gt; they need in the API&#39;s. Thanks,<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; David<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thanks, I have posted a query on their community forums. I&#39;ll see if I<br/>\n&gt; get any response.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I have also been using Hudson and have an &#39;issue&#39; with JUnit there too,<br/>\n&gt; but can&#39;t quite decide whether to start here or there. What I would like<br/>\n&gt; is a class of test which is known to fail, yet is still run on each<br/>\n&gt; commit, but doesn&#39;t block acceptance (largely because the &#39;bug&#39; has been<br/>\n&gt; there for years). I want to be reminded that these bugs are still there<br/>\n&gt; and also be advised if any are unintentionally fixed. This would also<br/>\n&gt; allow someone who discovers a bug to check in a test which illustrates<br/>\n&gt; the problem, while being unable to fix it themselves (whether for lack<br/>\n&gt; of skill or time).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Regards,<br/>\n&gt; Mark<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Kevin Lawrence did something really cool a couple years ago at Agitar<br/>\nthat I&#39;ve been wanting to re-implement ever since.  In JUnit &gt;=4.7, it<br/>\nwould look like this:<br/>\n<br/>\npublic class TestClass {<br/>\n   @Rule public BugCheck bugs = new BugCheck();<br/>\n<br/>\n   @Test public void failingDueToBug() {<br/>\n      bugs.associate(12345);<br/>\n      assertThat(...)<br/>\n   }<br/>\n}<br/>\n<br/>\nEssentially, this would check in a bug database: if bug 12345 was<br/>\nmarked fixed, then this would run normally.  But if bug 12345 was<br/>\nmarked as still open:<br/>\n<br/>\n* If the test failed, the failure would be ignored in the main report,<br/>\nand sent to a separate special report.<br/>\n* If the test passed, it would fail.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is doable on top of JUnit, and I&#39;d welcome the feature request or patch.<br/>\n<br/>\n   David<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; On Fri, May 21, 2010 at 1:10 PM, Mark Thornton<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mark.p.thornton@...\">mark.p.thornton@...</a> &lt;mailto:mark.p.thornton%40ntlworld.com&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Running the whole set works fine, but in IDEA at least attempting<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; run/debug an individual item doesn&#39;t work. Or rather it almost does. I<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; tried adding two constructors to the class intending that one would be<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; used for the parameterised runs and the default constructor would apply<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; to the individual tests. Unfortunately JUnit complains about having more<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; than one constructor.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; We currently work around this by using a second class which delegates to<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; the parameterised test class.
