The goal was to know what\n&gt; exception was thrown if the specific exception being tested is not\n&gt; thrown (without having to go to a stack trace).  This goal can be\n&gt; accomplished by catching Exception with a fail in the catch block and\n&gt; including the name of the exception in the fail message.\n\nMike,\n\nI agree with what you are trying to do, but I disagree violently to how you\nare trying to accomplish it.\n\nThe problem with your pattern is that, while you know the name of the\nexception, you&#39;ve lost all other information. You have no way of knowing\nfrom the output which line in the test caused the exception or which line\nin\nthe code actually threw the exception. In order to find out this\ninformation, you either have to use a debugger or modify the test. 9 times\nout of 10, the stack trace is more useful than the mere knowledge of what\nexception was actually thrown (which you don&#39;t lose anyway...\n\nAll this information is available in the framework already. All you need to\ndo is modify the TestRunner, or use a different one. For example, if you\nrun\nyour unit tests from an Ant script, you will find that the TestRunner\nprovided by Ant provides the class name, the message, and the stack trace.\n\nRobert.\n\n--\n     &quot;Duct tape is like the Force: it has a light side, a dark side,\n                   and it holds the universe together&quot;\n  Robert Watkins     robertdw@...     robertw@...\n\n\nTo unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\njunit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n\n\nYour use of Yahoo!
