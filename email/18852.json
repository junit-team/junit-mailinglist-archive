    "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2030872781\">It&#39;s Friday and I am having &quot;fun&quot; - the geeky sort of work-related<br/>\nfun, that is.<br/>\n<br/>\nI recently discovered Amazon.com&#39;s Mechanical Turk and created an<br/>\naccount to see how the idea of AAI (Artificial Artificial Intelligence<br/>\n- i.e. using human beings to work on tasks that computers generally<br/>\nsuck at, like pattern recognition) can be applied to testing<br/>\n(creating, reviewing, improving, running tests, etc.)  <br/>\n<br/>\nWith Mechanical Turk, people get paid for doing the tasks.  Payments<br/>\nrange from very small (e.g. $0.01 for deciding if a photo is a good)<br/>\nto more substantial (e.g. $10.00 for transcribing a podcast).<br/>\n<br/>\nMy first HIT (that stands for Human Intelligence Tasks - Amazon&#39;s<br/>\nterminology) is to ask someone to create a JUnit test that provides<br/>\n100% statement and conditional coverage for a trivial Java class. I am<br/>\noffering $1.11 for each test that meets the coverage criteria.<br/>\n<br/>\nNOTE:  I am not allowing people to use JUnit Factory to automatically<br/>\ngenerate the tests since we already know what those tests look like.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you want to have fun with this, I suggest you move quickly because<br/>\nAmazon.com makes it rather cumbersome to transfer funds to pay for<br/>\nHITs, so I only have $10 available right now, and until I can put more<br/>\nmoney into it, there are only a few hits I can pay for.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo &quot;play&quot; along just go to:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.mturk.com/mturk/welcome\">http://www.mturk.com/mturk/welcome</a><br/>\n<br/>\nand search for hits containing the keyword: &quot;junit&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nAgain, this is just for fun at this point...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAlberto<br/>\n<br/>\n----------<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.junitfactory.com\">http://www.junitfactory.com</a><br/>\nSend it Java.  Get back JUnit.<br/>\n100% free and 100% experimental.</div>",
