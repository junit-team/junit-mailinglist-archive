What\n&gt;     &gt; do I need to do, to cause the build to stop, if the check fails?\n&gt; \n&gt; &#39;haltonfailure=yes&#39; and/or &#39;haltonerror=yes&#39; should work here.\n\nHmmm. I tried both of these and it says that the attributes are not\nsupported\nby this task I&#39;ve created.\n\nI just took the simple sample application that was shown in the\ndocumentation\nand substituted the guts of the execute method with my logic. My class\nis a\nsubclass of Task, as is the sample in the docs. Any idea how I add\nsupport\nfor these attributes? Or better yet any pointers to documentation on how\nto\ncustomize Ant?\n\n\n&gt; \n&gt;     &gt; Also, can anyone give me some ideas as to how to kick off the mail\n&gt;     &gt; server? It is\n&gt;     &gt; a Java app. I guess I could do a &lt;java ...&gt; line, but how\n&gt;     &gt; do I make that\n&gt;     &gt; conditional?\n&gt;     &gt; Is there a way to set some &quot;property&quot;, as a result of the\n&gt;     &gt; &quot;dixiecheck&quot;,\n&gt;     &gt; such that\n&gt;     &gt; this app would be invoked based on that &quot;property&quot; or &quot;condition&quot;?\n&gt; \n&gt; does &lt;dixiecheck/&gt; startup DixieMail if it is not running?  If so, make the\n&gt; server a singleton and &quot;away you go.&quot;\n\nIt doesn&#39;t yet, but I guess I could. The server is a third party\napplication\nthat I downloaded and use, so I don&#39;t want to play with their source.\n\nI was thinking of two ways to kick off the server (any other ideas are\nwelcome):\n\nA) In the DixieCheck class, if the server is not running, launch it. I\nmust\n   admit, I&#39;m new to Java, so I&#39;m not sure of the appropriate way to do\nthis\n   (start another Java application from inside an app, like C&#39;s system()\ncall).\n\nB) Have the dixiecheck Ant task somehow (how?) set a &quot;property&quot;and then\nhave\n   another Ant task that forks java and runs the mailserver, if the\n&quot;property&quot;\n   is set (can I do a &lt;java fork=&quot;yes&quot; classname=&quot;...&quot;\nclasspath=&quot;...&quot;&gt;).\n\nAny comments on either of these two? Any other suggestions? Any pointers\non\nA and/or B?\n\n\nThanks Jason.\n\n\nPCM (Paul Michali)\n\nCarrier Voice Gateway Business Unit (CVGBU)\nCisco Systems, Inc.\n250 Apollo Drive\nChelmsford, MA 01824\n\nPhone : (800) 572-6771 x 45817  (978) 244-5817 [direct]\nPaging: (800) 365-4578 [voice]  pcm@...
