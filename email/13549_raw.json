Voice Recognition system: takes orders from client\nand posts request to a Servlet\n\n2. Messenger Servlet: Takes HTTP request from Voice\nsystem and publishes message (JMS using Oracle\nadvanced queues) to a queue. (Publish/Subscribe model)\n\n3. Uniface based Billing/Order management system: \nPicks messages from the queue and process the payment\ninformation. Then publishes another message to a\ndifferent queue(say B). \n\n4. third party gateway [in java]: picks up these\nmessages from the queue (B) and makes a webservice\ncall to a third party. Gets response and publishes\nback a message to queue C (separate response queue)\n\n5. Message passed back through same path and servlet\nresponds.  \n\nNow, everyone had their own way of testing, and the\nonly possible integration tests were manual. The\nBilling system and the voice system were limited in\nthe level of unit testing we could do (or atleast I\ncouldnt suggest them much as they aren&#39;t in Java)\n\nHowever, I would have liked to see a more consistent\ntesting strategy being used for components 2 and 4\nabove. \n\nDoes anyone have any suggestions as to how they would\napproach testing these?\n\nThanks,\nTandy\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n___________________________________________________________ \nYahoo!
