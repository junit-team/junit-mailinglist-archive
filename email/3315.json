This can be very complex task for testing <br/>\nonly one method, I don&#39;t want make this work.<br/>\nor<br/>\nb) create some fake classes with expected behaviour and offers its to <br/>\ntested class. But with linsk from tested class to instances to many <br/>\ndiferent classes (with many methods), creating this fake classes can <br/>\nbe very complex too.<br/>\n<br/>\nIs there some other way or have you some experiences with testing <br/>\nclasses with links to many instances of other classes? Any clue? :)<br/>\n<br/>\nSecond question:<br/>\nIf I have complex system and must test it (simulate real load, <br/>\nstress ...), which is the best way to do this, especialy how I <br/>\nrecognize expected status of system after tests and compare it to <br/>\nresult? <br/>\n<br/>\nThanx<br/>\n<br/>\nZdenek Smid</div>",
