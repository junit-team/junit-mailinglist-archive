The problem<br/>\nis that most of the solutions we&#39;ve come across (VNC, Citrix,<br/>\nMicrosoft) are either too sluggish to present the ideal illusion that<br/>\nwe are sharing the same instance of Eclipse, or don&#39;t play well with<br/>\nthe firewalls on our personal networks.  Has anyone tried a remote<br/>\npair-programming solution that they were 100% happy with?  Thanks,<br/>\n<br/>\n   David Saff</div>",
