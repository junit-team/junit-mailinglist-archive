This testXXX<br/>\n() can run more than one time depending on how much data is defined <br/>\nfor it in the XML file.  Each dataset test run would need to call <br/>\nthe setUp and tearDown routine.<br/>\n<br/>\nHas anyone ever tried to do something similar?  If so, I would <br/>\nreally appreciate some insight.  My thinking is that perhaps I could <br/>\ncreate a TestSuite for each testXXX() method and each dataset for <br/>\nthat testXXX() method would be added to the TestSuite:<br/>\n<br/>\nTestSuite methodSuite = new TestSuite();<br/>\n// the following line would be called as many times as there are<br/>\n// datasets for the testXXX method in the XML file<br/>\nmethodSuite.addTest(TestSuite.createTest(existingTestCase.getClass<br/>\n(), &quot;testXXX&quot;);<br/>\n<br/>\nMy problem is that how can I execute another setUp in methodSuite <br/>\nthat would allow me to create perhaps a Properties or Hashtable of <br/>\ndata tied to each testXXX dataset being added?  Is there a way to <br/>\ncall a setUp() in a TestSuite that would execute for each Test added <br/>\nto it AND still call the setUp for the Test as defined in the <br/>\nTestCase class?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\nJacqui</div>",
