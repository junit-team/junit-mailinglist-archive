The logic could be\n&gt; something like:\n&gt;\n&gt; if (I am asked to run a junit3 test on something) {\n&gt;    if (any methods have the @Test annotation) {\n&gt;       use junit4 behavior\n&gt;    }\n&gt;\n&gt;    fallback\n&gt; }\nWe could look at it.  However, the logic would be more likely that it \nwould try every possible way to run the class as a JUnit 3 test, and \nthen try JUnit 4 as a fallback (since not all JUnit 4 test classes have \n@Test).\n&gt; &gt; &gt; When you have an expected exception, and another one gets thrown, the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; error trace doesn&#39;t contain the bad exception. You only get:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; java.lang.AssertionError: Unexpected exception,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; expected&lt;java.util.NoSuchElementException&gt; but\n&gt; &gt; &gt; was&lt;java.lang.NullPointerException&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Having the trace of the bad exception would help TAs debug student\n&gt; code.\n&gt; &gt; That&#39;s a good idea.  We&#39;ll try to have that in the next release.\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks. This also comes up with timeouts. It&#39;d be really cool to have\n&gt; a stacktrace from where the thread was hung.\nAgreed.\n&gt; Oh, and since I&#39;m talking to another person from a school with a great\n&gt; CS dept ;-), I&#39;m really interested in writing good docs for students\n&gt; on how to write test suites, especially for data structures (the focus\n&gt; of the 15-211 course). I have something that I hacked up for our first\n&gt; homework, however, this kind of thing would be great to make into a\n&gt; tutorial that could be used by other classes.\nLecture 11 from MIT 6.170 is the best pre-prepared doc I know of around \nhere:\n\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu/OcwWeb/Electrical-Engineering-and-Computer-Science/6-170Laboratory-in-Software-EngineeringFall2001/LectureNotes/index.htm\n\nI&#39;d be very interested in your materials, as well, if they&#39;re publicly \navailable.  Thanks,\n\n    David Saff\n\n",
