I haven&#39;t gotten any messages from this list, but when I log \non to the website, I see people have responded. Thanks to everyone \nwho have responded so far.\n\n--- In junit@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Dave Astels&quot; &lt;dave@s...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; --- In junit@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Bryce Fischer&quot; &lt;bryce@b...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &lt;snip&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Given that I have two methods of my class I need to test, \nSaveLicense \n&gt; &gt; and LoadLicense, should I write this as two separate tests or as \na \n&gt; &gt; single test that incorporates both? To clarify, to load a \nlicense, I \n&gt; &gt; would need to have a saved license. The load license would then \nverify\n&gt; &gt; that the information that was saved was loaded correctly.\n&gt; \n&gt; The problem is saving, then loading, then verifying that the loaded\n&gt; object is equal to what was saved (if I understand your reasoning\n&gt; correctly) just tests that they you can load what you saved.  It\n&gt; doesn&#39;t verify that the format is correct.  Also, the two ate tied\n&gt; together.\n\nYou are understanding me correctly. Except that I&#39;m able to do this:\n\n1. Instantiate an object.\n2. Initialize the object with known values.\n3. Serialize the object.\n4. Load object into another variable.\n5. assertEquals on 2 objects.\n\nI have implemented equals methods on my classes so if they are not \nequal (not the same, but equal). In fact, I do some tests on my \nequals functions by taking 2 objects that should be equal, and also \ncomparing 2 objects that are not. I also verify that they are not the \nsame objects (i.e. obj1 == obj2)\n\n&gt; I advise a separate test for each (&quot;advise&quot; because you don&#39;t work \nfor\n&gt; me.. if you did, I&#39;d &quot;insist&quot;).  \n\nAnd that&#39;s why I&#39;m here. Trying to learn. In fact, I just got hired \nby this company and they don&#39;t do ANY testing... I&#39;m trying to move \nthem forward in this, so I appreciate the tips.\n\n&gt; And don&#39;t use real files if you can\n&gt; help it.  Use a mocked file for each test.  Save to a mock that \nknows\n&gt; what *should* be saved, then verify that that is what was saved.  \nRead\n&gt; from a fake that will supply a serialized object in the correct\n&gt; format, then verify that the loaded object is correct.  If you&#39;re\n&gt; using Java you can work work with streams and not worry about files \nat\n&gt; all.  If the output format is textual (i.e. not binary) you can \nsimply\n&gt; supply string streams in the test... Mocks can result in cleaner \ntest\n&gt; code, though.\n\nI&#39;ll look into Mocks. I&#39;ve read a little about them, but I&#39;m trying \nto take baby steps...\n\nMy main concern is that the functionality involved serializing to a \nfile, so I thought I&#39;d need to exercise that in a test (i.e., saving \nto a known location, then making sure it loads from the same known \nlocation, etc).\n\nThe output is binary, and I&#39;m working with streams all the way until \nI actually write the file.\n\nThanks again for your tips, and I hope that my emails start arriving \nsoon....\n\n\n\n",
