[mailto:margaret.lavin2@...]\nSent: 20 May 2002 13:11\nTo: junit@yahoogroups.com\nSubject: [junit] Concurrent Testing with Unique Data\n\n\nI&#39;ve written code to write forms to a Database, each form must have an\nindividual\nId number, which is hard coded in. Junit is perfect for testing this once.\n\n\nHowever if I wish to use a performance test on this (say a JunitPerf, Load\nTest to send multiple forms concurrently) this wont work, as the ID numbers\nwhich need too be unique are all the same, so previously exist in the\ndatabase,\ncausing an error.\n\nIs there an aspect of JunitPerf/Junit that allows for multiple test to be\npreformed when each individual test involves unique data?\n\nDoes anyone know a meethod around this?\n\nThank you :)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\njunit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n \n\nYour use of Yahoo!
