Couldn&#39;t you just &#39;diff&#39; them (assuming your on a nice =\r\n*nix system; I guess on Windows you need to resort to WinDiff) or is there =\r\nsomething I don&#39;t understand about the problem\n&gt;    diff -bw ReportA Report=\r\nB \n&gt; should do the trick.  You&#39;ll get differences between them if the runni=\r\nng times of tests are different but the serious differences should be obvio=\r\nus.\n&gt; \n&gt; Are you going to asses the differences visually or is this going t=\r\no be in a script; if the latter, the problem is more interesting (i.e. hard=\r\ner).\n&gt; \n&gt; Hope this helps\n&gt; \n&gt; jim\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In junit@yahoogroups.com, &quot;rohi=\r\ntkulkarni15&quot; &lt;rohitkulkarni15@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Hi,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Currently, I ha=\r\nve a requirement of comparing results of two JUnit reports(with same set of=\r\n tests).\n&gt; &gt; The result of this comparison activity should be to generate a=\r\n diff report that mentions only those tests whose status is different as co=\r\nmpared to the 1st result\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; i.e. If i have report A and report B, how=\r\n to get the list of differences between these two reports.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Can som=\r\neone please guide me on how to do this?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Thanks,\n&gt; &gt; Rohit\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n=\r\n\n",
