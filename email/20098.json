I am, however, using<br/>\ndocumentation asserts (in the comments) that actually shows up in the<br/>\nJUnit report in Eclipse, so I get pretty good feedback. One way of<br/>\nputting it is that I&#39;m test-driving the documentation while I&#39;m<br/>\ndocumentation-driving the tests... :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m still not sure exactly the best place to use Bumblebee (or<br/>\nProtest), but I know that for API-documentation it will definitely be<br/>\na good thing.<br/>\nWith TDDoc I experimented with Abbot tests (&quot;GUI-clicking&quot;) where I<br/>\ncomplemented the comments with images by pulling bitmaps from the<br/>\nSwing frames, and then generating JavaHelp files (using docbook), and<br/>\nit actually worked (with a few minor flaws). It should be possible to<br/>\ndo the same thing with Bumblebee. I don&#39;t want to start a new thread<br/>\non whether GUI-clicking is a good way to test your application (I<br/>\ngenerally think it is not), but with automatically generated JavaHelp<br/>\nin the equation the balance might change a bit for some people.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers<br/>\nDaniel, still wanting more feedback<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Nov 12, 2007 10:18 PM, Nat Pryce &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:nat.pryce@...\">nat.pryce@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Very interesting! I like the idea of generating useful documentation from<br/>\n&gt;  test code. I wrote a tool & test framework with similar goals for Python<br/>\n&gt;  called Protest (<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://xspecs.sf.net/protest.html)\">http://xspecs.sf.net/protest.html)</a>.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  One interesting effect I found when using Protest is that the generated<br/>\n&gt;  documentation was enough of a different perspective on the test code that<br/>\n&gt;  just skim-reading it gave really fast feedback on whether the tests acted<br/>\n&gt; as<br/>\n&gt;  a clear description of the tested code&#39;s behaviour.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  --Nat<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  On 11/11/2007, Daniel Brolund &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:daniel.brolund@...\">daniel.brolund@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;  &gt;<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; Hi all,<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; I would really appreciate some feedback on a small framework I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; writing for JUnit 4.4.<br/>\n&gt;  &gt;<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; I call it Bumblebee, and the purpose of it is to use comments and the<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; structures in the test-suites/cases/methods to create &quot;human-readable&quot;<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; documentation. It is especially well suited for writing snippet-heavy<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; documentation.<br/>\n&gt;  &gt;<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; In short, Bumblebee gets events from the execution of the tests<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; (suites/classes/methods) and then parses the classes and methods for<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; specific comments to include.<br/>\n&gt;  &gt;<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; By default it adds the de-camelcased names of the suites/cases/methods<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; as headings (a la agile dox), and the contained comments becomes the<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; paragraphs.<br/>\n&gt;  &gt;<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; The comments are actually handled as Ruby-strings that get executed in<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; a Bumblebee execution context before being added to the output. The<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; execution context is<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; a kind of DSL for including code-snippets and other things needed, and<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; one of the core ideas of Bumblebee is that you should be able to<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; extend that functionality easily.<br/>\n&gt;  &gt;<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; More detailed information about Bumblebee can be found at:<br/>\n&gt;  &gt;<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.agical.com/bumblebee/bumblebee_doc.html\">http://www.agical.com/bumblebee/bumblebee_doc.html</a><br/>\n&gt;  &gt;<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; which is of course generated with Bumblebee. :-)<br/>\n&gt;  &gt;<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; The concept of Bumblebee is the same as for TDDoc, which me and Joakim<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; Ohlrogge wrote some time ago as an add-on for RMock. Unfortunately,<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; TDDoc became a bit of a dead-end technically, and Joakim and I thought<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; it would be a good idea to start fresh. I happened to have the time at<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; the time and I started it up. So, if you like Bumblebee, give half of<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; your credits to Joakim!<br/>\n&gt;  &gt;<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; This is an early release, and I will be very happy for any feedback I<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; can get to improve it.<br/>\n&gt;  &gt;<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; Cheers<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; Daniel Brolund<br/>\n&gt;  &gt;<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; __________________________<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; Daniel Brolund<br/>\n&gt;  &gt;<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; Agical AB<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; Västerlånggatan 79, 2 tr<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; 111 29 Stockholm, SWEDEN<br/>\n&gt;  &gt;<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; web: www.agical.com<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; mob: +46-708-754002<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; mail: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:daniel.brolund@...\">daniel.brolund@...</a> &lt;daniel.brolund%40agical.com&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; blog: danielbrolund.wordpress.com<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; priv: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:daniel.brolund@...\">daniel.brolund@...</a> &lt;daniel.brolund%40gmail.com&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  &gt;<br/>\n&gt;  &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n__________________________<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Daniel.Brolund@...\">Daniel.Brolund@...</a> </span></blockquote></div>",
