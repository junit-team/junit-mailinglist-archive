If you <br/>\n&gt; &gt; implement me, you&#39;d better pass my Contract Tests, or you don&#39;t really <br/>\n&gt; &gt; implement me. If the above example were really important, there&#39;d be a <br/>\n&gt; test.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; That&#39;s a good idea, and if I&#39;d ever seen it done in practice I might be <br/>\n&gt; more willing to accept it. In fact,. I have never once seen an interface <br/>\n&gt; based API that came with a set of tests implementations were required to <br/>\n&gt; pass. This includes major APIs shipped by organizations like JavaSoft <br/>\n&gt; and the W3C, not just internal corporate work and open source hacking.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Of course, I&#39;ve never looked at your codebase. Given that you do this, I <br/>\n&gt; suspect your code is likely more robust and reliable than what i see out <br/>\n&gt; there, which doesn&#39;t really surprise me. It&#39;s long been known that a <br/>\n&gt; small percentage of programmers are vastly more productive than most <br/>\n&gt; programmers are. I suspect the programmers who hang out on mailing <br/>\n&gt; lists, attend conferences, write and read articles, and so forth tend to <br/>\n&gt; be in the more productive group. However, these are not the majority of <br/>\n&gt; working developers, and realistic API design has to work for the <br/>\n&gt; majority of client programmers, not just the top 10%.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -- <br/>\n&gt; Elliotte Rusty Harold <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:elharo@...\">elharo@...</a><br/>\n&gt; XML in a Nutshell 3rd Edition Just Published!<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.cafeconleche.org/books/xian3/\">http://www.cafeconleche.org/books/xian3/</a><br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0596007647/cafeaulaitA/ref=nosim\">http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0596007647/cafeaulaitA/ref=nosim</a><br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;  ------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>That&#39;s pretty much the practical application of the Liskov Substitution <br/>\nPrinciple that I have in mind when I&#39;m developing.
