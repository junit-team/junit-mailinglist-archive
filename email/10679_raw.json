This testXXX\n() can run more than one time depending on how much data is defined \nfor it in the XML file.  Each dataset test run would need to call \nthe setUp and tearDown routine.\n\nHas anyone ever tried to do something similar?  If so, I would \nreally appreciate some insight.  My thinking is that perhaps I could \ncreate a TestSuite for each testXXX() method and each dataset for \nthat testXXX() method would be added to the TestSuite:\n\nTestSuite methodSuite = new TestSuite();\n// the following line would be called as many times as there are\n// datasets for the testXXX method in the XML file\nmethodSuite.addTest(TestSuite.createTest(existingTestCase.getClass\n(), &quot;testXXX&quot;);\n\nMy problem is that how can I execute another setUp in methodSuite \nthat would allow me to create perhaps a Properties or Hashtable of \ndata tied to each testXXX dataset being added?  Is there a way to \ncall a setUp() in a TestSuite that would execute for each Test added \nto it AND still call the setUp for the Test as defined in the \nTestCase class?\n\nThanks,\nJacqui\n\n\n\n\n",
