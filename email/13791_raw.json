A have found no way to customize the way they are compiled\nto use the AspectJ specific compilers. Hence, I cannot benefit of AOP\nwhen unit testing.\n\nIs this just a technical matter, or is it politically\n(philosophically, theologically) wrong to try to perform unit testing\non AOP components ?\n\nMany thanks for any advice.\n\nMark\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
