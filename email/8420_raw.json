Here you test the behaviour of\nyour integrated application against a predefined\nbehaviour with the mock objects.You may not be able to\ndo all the tests here which you could do as part of\nyour unit test.\nEven an integration test test wont guarantee that your\ncode is going to work in a system test with the true\nexternal components in place.\n\nRgds\nBJ\n\n--- Mike Bresnahan &lt;java-junit@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; I have experience with integration testing but not\n&gt; much with unit testing.\n&gt; I&#39;ve been reading up on unit testing  (e.g. mock\n&gt; objects, test first\n&gt; development).  However, I have not found an article\n&gt; that explains the\n&gt; advantages of unit testing vs integration testing. \n&gt; My perhaps naive hunch\n&gt; is that the cost-per-bug-eliminated of unit testing\n&gt; is higher than that of\n&gt; integration testing.  It appears this way because a\n&gt; single integration test\n&gt; tests a lot more code than a single unit test and\n&gt; takes about the same\n&gt; amount of time to construct.  Plus it seems to me\n&gt; that a whole suite of unit\n&gt; tests with 100% code coverage cannot guarantee that\n&gt; even the simplest system\n&gt; wide behavior is correct (e.g. the web page\n&gt; appears).  Am I wrong about\n&gt; this?  Can someone refer me information about this\n&gt; topic.  A scientific\n&gt; study paper with real numbers would be welcome.\n&gt; \n&gt; Mike Bresnahan\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nSBC Yahoo!
