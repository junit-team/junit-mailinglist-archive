No. But you may learn something by doing this way to start.<br/>\n<br/>\nPeople often ask, &quot;Do I need to write all these tests?&quot; We usually <br/>\nanswer, &quot;Only if you want the code to work.&quot; Until you know better (have <br/>\nmore experience), it is worthwhile to write more tests than fewer tests.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat said, if you notice that ten tests do essentially the same thing, <br/>\nthen you have uncovered some duplication in your production code! If you <br/>\ncan remove the duplication, then you can reduce the number of tests, <br/>\npossibly down to one. This is a very common pattern in adding tests to <br/>\ncode without tests.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Data Access Object is a perfect example of a class that tends to <br/>\nhave /massive amounts/ of duplication, making it look more difficult to <br/>\ntest than it could be. I write about this in chapter 10 of _JUnit <br/>\nRecipes_. (www.manning.com/rainsberger)<br/>\n<br/>\nI also write about how to organize test cases into fixtures (= test case <br/>\nclasses) in chapter 3.<br/>\n<br/>\nYour line of thinking is good: one test case class per /method/ being <br/>\ntested. Try it. I don&#39;t recommend using numbers in the names. Instead, <br/>\ntry these test case class names:<br/>\n<br/>\nSamuraiDAOFightTest<br/>\nSamuraiDAOMeditateTest<br/>\n...<br/>\n<br/>\nYou&#39;ll notice some duplication. Use the usual techniques (Extract <br/>\nMethod, Extract Superclass) to remove that duplication. If you&#39;re not <br/>\nfamiliar with refactoring, then buy a copy of &quot;Refactoring: Improving <br/>\nthe Design of Existing Code&quot; /now/. Don&#39;t look at the price of the book. <br/>\nIt&#39;ll return its value in the first week.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck.<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJ. B.
