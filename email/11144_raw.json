I\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; know that I often feel that certain refactoring directions I&#39;d like to\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; try are closed to me because of the fairly strict structure of the \n&gt; JUnit\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; testing framework.\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; Do you have a specific example? Given that the structure (hierarchy) of\n&gt;  &gt; test classes does not need to reflect the structure of production\n&gt;  &gt; classes, what kinds of refactorings are difficult in JUnit but easy in\n&gt;  &gt; NUnit? This is the kind of thing I need to explore, because my JUnit\n&gt;  &gt; preconceptions hold me back when thinking in NUnit. You could jump-start\n&gt;  &gt; me. :)\n&gt; \n&gt; Oh, it&#39;s often more to do with changing the testing framework itself.\n&gt; I&#39;ve found that in Java I&#39;m often stymied because someone has not\n&gt; declared an interface for something I wish he had, and so I can&#39;t\n&gt; replace his object with my own when I want to do something he&#39;s not\n&gt; considered. With languages such as SmallTalk and Ruby, this tends to be\n&gt; less of a problem because I so long as I supply an object that answers\n&gt; the necessary messages, it will work.\n\nI see. If I can find an analog, there&#39;s no need for something like \nJUnit-addons in NUnit, because NUnit is already quite flexible. Close?\n\n&lt;snip /&gt;\n&gt; Anyway, I&#39;ve appended a little example I was playing with this morning\n&gt; where I ended up making a test suite that was just a hash of inputs\n&gt; and expected results, something you&#39;d typically have to build up a\n&gt; parameterized test case for. The key code ends up being, instead, just:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;     fibtest_hash = { 0 =&gt; 0, 1 =&gt; 1, 2 =&gt; 1, 3 =&gt; 2, 4 =&gt; 3, 5 =&gt; 5, 6 \n&gt; =&gt; 8 }\n&gt; \n&gt;     def fibtest_hash.calculate_result(input)\n&gt;       Fib.new.fib(input)\n&gt;     end\n&gt; \n&gt;     fibtest_hash.extend(TestEachInputExpectedPair)\n&gt; \n&gt;     Test::Unit::UI::Console::TestRunner.run(fibtest_hash)\n\nThis is the first time I&#39;ve seen a singleton method, and understood what \nit&#39;s for. (I had an Aha! experience very recently about the power of \nsuch beasts.)\n\n&lt;pause /&gt;\n\nI just read the relevant section in Programming Ruby about extending \nobjects. Very neat. I obviously need to do more Ruby programming.\n\n&gt; Of course, that object doesn&#39;t have to be a Hash. It might be, for\n&gt; example, a database query that pulls data from test runs against an\n&gt; oracle, or even the oracle itself:\n&gt; \n&gt;     suite = SQLQuery.new(&quot;SELECT input, result FROM old_test_run&quot;)\n&gt; \n&gt;     def suite.calculate_result(input)\n&gt;       ...\n&gt;     end\n&gt; \n&gt;     suite.extend(TestEachInputExpectedPair)\n&gt; \n&gt;     Test::Unit::UI::Console::TestRunner.run(suite)\n&gt; \n&gt; Unfortunately, I&#39;m out of time today to think about this further....\n\nPlease do, and write about it. I&#39;m going to read the code you pasted \nmore carefully and try to let it sink in. Neat stuff.\n\nThanks.\n-- \nJ. B.
