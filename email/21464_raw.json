There are still lots of tools that depend fairly strongly on\nthat gu=\r\narantee.  There&#39;s not a defined mixing of the JUnit 4.x and\nJUnit 3.x rules=\r\n--the simple things seem to work together, as you\ndemonstrate, but the more=\r\n advanced extension mechanisms would make\nexactly defining the mix very dif=\r\nficult.\n\nIf you want to enforce the JUnit 4 rules, even if the class extend=\r\ns\nTestCase, you can annotate your class with @RunWith(JUnit4.class)\n\n1) In =\r\nyour current case, it would require very little effort to\nannotate the rema=\r\nining desired methods with @Test.  Is there a real\nsituation in which it is=\r\n a significant amount of effort to update a\nclass all at once?\n\n2) Where di=\r\nd you look in the documentation?  Where would be a natural\nplace to see thi=\r\ns behavior described?\n\nThanks,\n\n   David Saff\n\nOn Tue, Mar 31, 2009 at 3:40=\r\n AM, jduprez4junit &lt;jethrie@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Hello,\n&gt;\n&gt; as advised on ht=\r\ntp://www.junit.org/forum/16, I&#39;m posting to this list\n&gt; the following probl=\r\nem - in summary, jUnit4 annotations are ignored by\n&gt; jUnit 4 runners when t=\r\nhe test class is explicitly extending TestCase.\n&gt;\n&gt; This case is not uncomm=\r\non: many users still have jUnit-3.8-style test\n&gt; suites and cases, which ru=\r\nn unchanged in jUnit4, but may want to enhance\n&gt; them gradually, by introdu=\r\ncing jUnit4 annotations.\n&gt;\n&gt; Here is the problem demonstrated as a test cla=\r\nss: =A0the comments mark the\n&gt; test methods which behave unexpectedly.\n&gt;\n&gt; =\r\npublic class TestJUnit4FeaturesBreakIfClassExtendsTestCase extends\n&gt; TestCa=\r\nse {\n&gt; =A0 @Test\n&gt; =A0 public void testMethodWithNameConventionAndTestAnnot=\r\nation() {\n&gt; =A0 =A0 // Is executed by jUnit 4, as expected\n&gt; =A0 }\n&gt;\n&gt; =A0 =\r\npublic void testMethodWithNameConventionAlone() {\n&gt; =A0 =A0 fail(&quot;Is execut=\r\ned by jUnit 4 whereas it should be ignored&quot;);\n&gt; =A0 }\n&gt;\n&gt; =A0 @Test\n&gt; =A0 p=\r\nublic void thisIsATestMethodWithTestAnnotationAlone() {\n&gt; =A0 =A0 // Is not=\r\n executed by jUnit 4 despite @Test\n&gt; =A0 }\n&gt;\n&gt; =A0 @Test\n&gt; =A0 @Ignore\n&gt; =\r\n=A0 public void testMethodWithNameConventionAndTestIgnoreAnnotation() {\n&gt; =\r\n=A0 =A0 fail(&quot;Is executed by jUnit 4 despite @Ignore&quot;);\n&gt; =A0 }\n&gt; }\n&gt;\n&gt; Doe=\r\ns jUnit intentionally run TestCases subclasses a la 3.8 - to ensure\n&gt; backw=\r\nards compatibility of legacy tests, unchanged?\n&gt; It would be a limitation, =\r\nand indeed makes code such as the extract\n&gt; above misleading (as the now fa=\r\nmiliar annotations do not work as\n&gt; expected).\n&gt; Besides, I haven&#39;t seen th=\r\nis documented in the docs, so I assume it&#39;s\n&gt; not intentional.\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks i=\r\nn advance for following up.\n&gt;\n&gt; =A0 =A0 J.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; [Non-text portions of th=\r\nis message have been removed]\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
