None of us are omniscient.  And, in fact, <br/>\n&gt;&gt;many of of us didn&#39;t see that people might want to write tests for code <br/>\n&gt;&gt;that uses our APIs eventually, for instance. <br/>\n&gt;&gt;    <br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Let&#39;s try to stay away from absolutes like omniscience and focus on <br/>\n&gt;relative quantities instead. Just because none of us are omniscient <br/>\n&gt;doesn&#39;t mean none of us know better, especially in particular domains.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;While I would not presume to tell a statistician how to use a statistics <br/>\n&gt;API, I wouldn&#39;t presume to design one either because I am not an expert <br/>\n&gt;in the field. I do know just enough about statistics to be dangerous. <br/>\n&gt;That is why when I need to write statistics code I go looking for a <br/>\n&gt;statistics library that will help me by, among other things, revealing <br/>\n&gt;the gaps and flaws in my understanding.<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>If you have users who have significant experience in a domain, you can <br/>\ndesign a statistical library.  See my other post.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;By contrast, when I&#39;m working with XML, I probably do know better than <br/>\n&gt;most what is needed, which is why I have written my own API. However <br/>\n&gt;there probably aren&#39;t 100 people who know XML as well as I do, and an <br/>\n&gt;API designed just for them wouldn&#39;t be very useful. Instead I publish a <br/>\n&gt;library that is appropriate for people who do know less than I do within <br/>\n&gt;the specific field of XML. Knowing less is perfectly fine. Lord knows <br/>\n&gt;most developers have better things to do with their lives than studying <br/>\n&gt;the arcana of the various XML specifications.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Do people occasionally get rubbed wrong by the strictness of my API? <br/>\n&gt;Yes. However in almost every case, that&#39;s because what they want to do <br/>\n&gt;is wrong and contrary to their needs. They just don&#39;t know know as much <br/>\n&gt;about XML as I do so they don&#39;t realize that. The problems they have <br/>\n&gt;using my API are symptoms of a deeper underlying problem with their <br/>\n&gt;understanding and use of XML. Because my API refuses to let them do what <br/>\n&gt;they want, they learn the right way of doing things.<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Not exactly user-centered design, is it? <br/>\n<br/>\nMichael Feathers<br/>\nwww.objectmentor.com</div>",
