My code \ncompiles but throws resource exceptions when it tries to (for \nexample) create a database. I presume this is because the MIDP \nclasses call native functions and the emulator has some reference to \na dll somewhere that the test classes aren&#39;t aware of.\n\nHas anyone got much experience with this ? Any solutions ?\n\n\n",
