This allows you to test the \nlogic of your code without actually using the network at anypoint, giving you \na lot of fine control over what happens when.  Plus it encourages you to \nfactor out the transport level stuff which is a Good Thing (tm) anyway.  \n\nThe approach I took last time I tried (before I&#39;d got my head around the above \nidea, being a JUnit novice at the time myself) was to consider the unit \ntesting as testing the public interface of the class, with the network calls \nbeing part of that interface.  To aid this kind of testing I wrote a simple \nNetworkTester class that enabled simple send/expect conversations to be \ncarried out from either a server, or clients perspective.  \nThe advantage of this is that you often expose some of the subtle networking \nrelated problems that you might not see until production or (hopefully) \nstress testing.  Whether it counts as unit testing or not is maybe debatable.\n\nHope this makes some kinda sense.\nShez\n\nOn Tuesday 21 May 2002 9:49 am, Jason Novotny wrote:\n&gt; In my codebase, I have a simple client and server that should work if\n&gt; the server receives a hello message from the client and then echos back\n&gt; to the client.
