Should I just test that the query runs without error and not worry about the \nreturn?  Or should I check certain parts to make sure thay are right?  Or check the \nentire result set?\n\nQuestion#2: I have many SQL queries with multiple possiblities in the WHERE clause.  \nThey are being built on the fly based on the search criteria given by a user.  I was \ngoing to test each WHERE clause in a seperate test. Should I write the tests in such a \nway that I could combine calls to them and have a test case that is more of a \ncontroller pattern?\npseudo code as follows\n&lt;code&gt;\npublic void combinedTest1(){\n     SearchVO search = buildSearchVO ( add two parameters);\n     \n     performSearchTest(search);\n\n     search = buildSearchVO(two other parameters);\n\n      performSearchTest(search);\n}&lt;/code&gt;\n\n\n\n",
