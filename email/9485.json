If you can demonstrate more than a single percentage<br/>\npoint of difference in performance please post the results and I will<br/>\neat my proverbial hat.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf there is a relationship between size of code and performance, it is<br/>\nthat complex code has more interactions so feels slower than small<br/>\nsimple code. It&#39;s nothing to do with the size of the identifiers!<br/>\n<br/>\nThe point that lots of people are making here is plain: Well factored,<br/>\nmeaningfully written code is vastly superior to badly written,<br/>\nsprawling cryptic code. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis is true even for performance critical code. If there are<br/>\nbottlenecks revealed by your profiler, having well factored meaningful<br/>\ncode will allow you to do something about them. Badly maintained and<br/>\npurposely obfuscated code will discourage you from even trying, in case<br/>\nyou break something you don&#39;t understand.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Wed, 2003-09-24 at 02:38, Jason Rogers wrote:<br/>\n&gt; On Tue, 23 Sep 2003 19:30:13 -0000, &quot;ssmith12345uk&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:shauns@...\">shauns@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; said:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I must confess, I am definitely one of the &#39;comment extremely <br/>\n&gt; &gt; sparsely&#39; crowd.  What might be interesting is if we perhaps wrote a <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Ruby program to process a Java source tree, replacing the symbols <br/>\n&gt; &gt; with the smallest identifiers possible, unless they are tagged with <br/>\n&gt; &gt; a @published tag for external compatibility reasons.  I would expect <br/>\n&gt; &gt; to be able to produce a readable and maintainable program to do this <br/>\n&gt; &gt; with very few comments indeed.  I also expect to be able to write a <br/>\n&gt; &gt; program to convert a stack trace back to the original symbols, again <br/>\n&gt; &gt; with very few comments.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Do you think that might be a worthwhile or interesting exercise?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I, for one, would be very interested in this.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --<br/>\n&gt; =jason<br/>\n&gt; [:question | ^One]<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\">junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
