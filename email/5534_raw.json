Two months is more like it for this \nmany classes.  I have done moderate size packages in a day.\n\nAnd yes, the QA&#39;s should not be writing JUnit code.  I have seen them \ncompose test cases or at least sign off on test case development when a \nVisual Composition version is provided for them.  They don&#39;t see the code, \njust icons and parameters in a tree like structure that they easily \nunderstand.\n\nTest Mentor is ready for prime time in these two aspects, at least based on \nour experience.\n\nThe price is rather attractive.  We had an ROI in one case of about 2 weeks. \n(Cost saving model.)  And of course some things are not possible for QA&#39;s \nand customers at any price without such technology.  That leave only the \n&quot;hire a black belt&quot; option or do without.  Both tough choices in a \nrecession.\n\n&gt;From: &quot;Vladimir Bossicard&quot; &lt;vbossica@...&gt;\n&gt;Reply-To: junit@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;To: junit@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;Subject: RE: [junit] How to automate the testcases!\n&gt;Date: Mon, 05 Aug 2002 08:37:49 -0700 (PDT)\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; I want to test a library containing more than 1000 classes and\n&gt; &gt; lots of methods.\n&gt;\n&gt;I&#39;m sure you don&#39;t &#39;want&#39; but &#39;have to&#39; test this library :-)\n&gt;\n&gt;Let&#39;s not mention that JUnit is primilarly entended for programmers and not \n&gt;QAs\n&gt;(no offense, I just want to say that if QAs are the ones starting to use \n&gt;JUnit,\n&gt;something&#39;s wrong in the project).\n&gt;\n&gt;In your place, I would go to your manager and expose the fact that testing\n&gt;1,000 classes will take you months if not years.  If he wants to ship in \n&gt;two\n&gt;years, fine... but I bet it&#39;s not what he wants.\n&gt;\n&gt;I can&#39;t imagine that the developers spend all their time writing code \n&gt;without\n&gt;some kind of testing.  Chances are that some test code has been written \n&gt;(just\n&gt;pray that developers haven&#39;t only used &#39;println&#39;) so try to reuse their \n&gt;code\n&gt;into JUnit tests and (even better) try to convince your manager to let the\n&gt;developers do this.  You can then run a code coverage tool to have a look \n&gt;where\n&gt;the code has not been tested.\n&gt;\n&gt;If you want to do negative testing (since it&#39;s a library, it must be pretty\n&gt;solid) JUnit may not be the best tool for this.  But you can write some\n&gt;extensions that test that a class is not crashing.\n&gt;\n&gt;-Vladimir\n&gt;\n&gt;--\n&gt;Vladimir Bossicard\n&gt;www.bossicard.com\n&gt;\n&gt;To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt;junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Your use of Yahoo!
