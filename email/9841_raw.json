At least if I run the tests with ant I\n&gt; &gt; get an output similar to:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Testcase: testDateIsActiveNullDate took 0,016 sec\n&gt; &gt; Testcase: testDateIsActiveToday took 0,031 sec\n&gt; &gt; Testcase: testDateIsActivePast took 0,047 sec\n&gt; &gt; ...\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m not sure how much use this kind of micro-testing would be, though\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m sure you could set up your test cases to provide more valid data.\n&gt;\n&gt; I haven&#39;t done very careful testing, but I certainly have noticed that\n&gt; the times reported by JUnit vary a great deal.\n&gt;\n&gt; Running one simple set of tests just now gave me results in which 50%\n&gt; differences were common and more than one test took 3x as long from one\n&gt; run to the next.  So, sure, you can use JUnit for this sort of simple\n&gt; performance testing, but you should at least run the tests enough times to\n&gt; build statistical confidence in the results.\n&gt;\n&gt; It didn&#39;t show up in these few runs, but I believe that I have noticed\n&gt; before that the first test reported a much longer than normal time --\n&gt; seconds rather than milliseconds.  So the order in which tests are run\n&gt; might introduce an effect large enough to render the results useless.\n\nAs far as I have observed the JUnit times are true run time and not CPU\ntime. So they depend very much on all the other tasks that the machine\nhappens to be running. They&#39;re a good first indicator but cannot really be\nused for evaluating the impact of a performance improvements.\n\nAnother thing is that compared to other languages, evaluating performance\nimprovements in Java requires that code is run in the same order each time\n(for a single start of the VM). Java simply runs familiar stuff faster than\nnew code.\n\nAlthough the test timings in JUnit may have little use in terms of\nperformance testing they have one very important and indispencable value: if\nrunning my &quot;AllTests&quot; takes a day or two I won&#39;t run them often enough, they\nmust take less than half an hour so it can run during lunch. The JUnit\ntimings guide me to where I should optimize my tests in order to maximize\n&quot;test value/test excecution time&quot;.\n\nMorten\n\n\n",
