The last<br/>\n&gt;&gt;  notes I can find on the JUnit site bemoan the fact JUnit4 has not been<br/>\n&gt;&gt;  integrated into any IDEs or test and build tools yet.  However that<br/>\n&gt;&gt;  was over a year ago.  Any update on this?  I would be particularly<br/>\n&gt;&gt;  interested in:<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;  Eclipse<br/>\n&gt;&gt;  Netbeans<br/>\n&gt;&gt;  IntelliJ<br/>\n&gt;&gt;  Cruise Control<br/>\n&gt;&gt;  Fitnesse<br/>\n&gt;&gt;  JSystem<br/>\n&gt;&gt;  maven<br/>\n&gt;&gt;  cactus<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve used Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, CruiseControl and Maven on projects<br/>\n&gt; that used JUnit 4. As far as I can remember, there was no need to<br/>\n&gt; tweak anything about the IDEs or CruiseControl but we needed to<br/>\n&gt; install a snapshot version of Maven&#39;s surefire plugin because JUnit 4<br/>\n&gt; support wasn&#39;t yet released back then but it&#39;s now supported out of<br/>\n&gt; the box so that shouldn&#39;t be an issue anymore.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m not sure how Fitnesse relates to JUnit(?), I haven&#39;t used Cactus<br/>\n&gt; in ages, and I hadn&#39;t even heard of JSystem before now so no comment<br/>\n&gt; about those.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I hope this helps,<br/>\n&gt; Lasse<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Lasse,<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for the quick response.  Your response makes me feel a lot <br/>\nbetter.  I was just reading up on Eclipse and JUnit4 so I am glad to <br/>\nhear most of the rest is good also.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for the other products, JSystem I saw listed on the JUnit pages as a <br/>\ntool to expand unit testing to system/functional testing.  Fitnesse (if <br/>\nit is even still maintained) was intended to pick up testing where the <br/>\ndeveloper leaves off and the customer picks up so is geared towards <br/>\ncustomer definable acceptance tests.  I need to go read up again because <br/>\nI don&#39;t recall if it uses JUnit under the covers, or can be used to at <br/>\nleast re-run the JUnit tests on the customer facing test site or what. <br/>\nI was just covering all bases on my request.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks again,<br/>\nRobert Kuropkat</div>",
