Using data in a file means worrying about where the files are on the file system when executing the tests.\n\nUse a relative offset from your project.home\n\n\n&gt; 3. What if I need to execute the tests on a file system that doesn&#39;t understand &quot;g:/myCsvFiles&quot;? (Yes, there are solutions, but none as easy as not having to worry about it.)\n\nWhat if I need to compile the java on a file system that doesn&#39;t \nunderstand &quot;g:/myCsvFiles&quot;?\n\n\n&gt; 4. Tests that require the file system are slower.\n\nNot much. And not at all if you&#39;re testing through changing/adding \nfiles and not by changing the code.\n\n\n&gt; 5. Cleaning up the file system is asynchronous (from what I can tell) and unreliable to do in tests that execute at a rate of dozens per second.\n\nIf you have to clean up the file system, clean up at the end the \nrun; use Ant to rmdir.\n\n\n&gt; Processing the data is separate from reading/writing the data. This implies two separate classes.\n&gt; \n&gt; csvDataProcessor.findDuplicates(new CsvFileReader(fileName));\n&gt; ...\n&gt; \n&gt; This is exactly how XSL transformers work: transforming XML and reading/writing XML are separate concerns.\n\n+1\n\nBill de h�ra\n\n\n-- \nSorry, I don&#39;t know the word &quot;sorry&quot;.- SHRDLU\n\n\n",
