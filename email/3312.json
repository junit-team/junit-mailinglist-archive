I may be overconfident about my<br/>\ncode, but the next person who works on that unit won&#39;t be and will add<br/>\ntests as they learn about it. Using coverage analysis tools sparingly also<br/>\nhelps. Many XP groups will stop and take day for just refactoring every so<br/>\noften. This is a good time to do some coverage analysis and maybe run some<br/>\nother design quality metrics and discuss the output.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; In your situation maybe you could adapt the XP Pair-programming technique so<br/>\n&gt; that you have a developer and a QA-er writing test suites together.  The QA<br/>\n&gt; gains visibility of the tests, the developer has an objective set of tests<br/>\n&gt; that they have to get green.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Although I don&#39;t hold out much hope: I&#39;ve tried to interest people here in<br/>\n&gt; &quot;Pair programming&quot; and you would have thought I proposing something dirty -<br/>\n&gt; in fact I would probably have got less of an adverse reaction if I *had*<br/>\n&gt; proposed something dirty ;P<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Approach it slowly. When a good programmer runs into trouble, they will<br/>\nsit down with someone else and pair program through it naturally, without<br/>\nthinking about it. Encourage this. Also encourage your experienced<br/>\nprogrammers to sit down with the inexperienced ones and pair program with<br/>\nthem to help them through specific problems or learn particular techniques<br/>\n(as a teaching exercise). You can generally get this far without much<br/>\nresistance and you&#39;ve already got a good bit of the benefit.<br/>\n<br/>\nNext, go to pairing off for cross training (your UNIX guru learns a<br/>\nlittle about the Windows APIs for an afternoon). Introduce the concept a<br/>\nlittle at a time in situations where it&#39;s benefits are obvious. Once<br/>\npeople get used to it, the social stigma starts to fade.<br/>\n<br/>\nRemember to give your programmers some time and space to explore things by<br/>\nthemselves, though, even when they are doing pair programming regularly.<br/>\nSome programmers are more solitary by nature and will need that space more<br/>\noften. I, for instance, need a certain amount of quiet and solitude every<br/>\nwork day to be productive whether I am programming, managing, or team<br/>\nlead/coaching.  If you make it clear you aren&#39;t going to take that away,<br/>\nyour programmers will be less reluctant to pair off.  Solitary coding time<br/>\ncan be used for self-education, prototyping, toolsmithing or research<br/>\nwhich can then be brought back into the group.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Still, it might be worth your while to try.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve though some more about your problem and logging test failures into<br/>\n&gt; Bugzilla (or whatever) is a non-starter.  Consider: new bug logged every<br/>\n&gt; time you run the same test and it fails; you have to associate a test with a<br/>\n&gt; bug number; once a test passes JUnit has to search the database and update<br/>\n&gt; the bug report.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; If you want something that&#39;s more generally usable you might want to<br/>\n&gt; consider something like Silvermark&#39;s TestMentor which comes with lots of<br/>\n&gt; graphical goodies and reports :) but isn&#39;t free :(<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; rgds, APC<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; A P Clarke<br/>\n&gt; Consultant<br/>\n&gt; CMG Admiral UK - Radio Spectrum International<br/>\n&gt; Wyndham House<br/>\n&gt; 189 Marsh Wall<br/>\n&gt; London<br/>\n&gt; E14 9SH<br/>\n&gt; Tel: +44 (0)20 7211 0603<br/>\n&gt; Fax: +44 (0)20 7211 0364<br/>\n&gt; Mobile:-----------------------<br/>\n&gt; Internet communications are not secure and therefore CMG UK Ltd does not<br/>\n&gt; accept legal responsibility for the contents of this message.

Kent says we&#39;re supposed to cycle through the<br/>\n&gt; testing and coding stages a few times until our code has no bugs.  So<br/>\n&gt; what<br/>\n&gt; is there to track?  same goes for integration: providing we&#39;re<br/>\n&gt; developing in<br/>\n&gt; small enough chunks, of course.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Or look at it another way: our failed tests are their own bug<br/>\n&gt; trackingdevice.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Automatically populating a bug track database from failed tests would<br/>\n&gt; only<br/>\n&gt; make sense when the people running the tests aren&#39;t the same people who<br/>\n&gt; are<br/>\n&gt; developing the code, for instance users in UAT or a &quot;black box&quot; testing<br/>\n&gt; cell.  I don&#39;t think JUnit is sufficiently abstract for the former but I<br/>\n&gt; can<br/>\n&gt; see that the latter could be writing their own JUnit suites (if they<br/>\n&gt; know<br/>\n&gt; Java).  In which case your question is simply a variant on the &quot;How do I<br/>\n&gt; log<br/>\n&gt; output from JUnit?&quot; question, only instead of writing to a logfile you<br/>\n&gt; want<br/>\n&gt; to insert the results into an error tracking database.  How difficult<br/>\n&gt; that<br/>\n&gt; is depends on the database in question: if it&#39;s something proprietary<br/>\n&gt; like<br/>\n&gt; Merant Tracker I imagine there&#39;ll be a few more problems than if (like<br/>\n&gt; us)<br/>\n&gt; you&#39;re using a homebrew system based on tables sitting in your<br/>\n&gt; development<br/>\n&gt; Oracle DB.  The Bugzilla FAQ does say we write to the database using the<br/>\n&gt; Mozilla XML API so it would be possible to do, but I think you&#39;ll be<br/>\n&gt; lucky<br/>\n&gt; to find anyone who&#39;s actually done it :P<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; rgds, APC<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; A P Clarke<br/>\n&gt; Consultant<br/>\n&gt; CMG Admiral UK - Radio Spectrum International<br/>\n&gt; Wyndham House<br/>\n&gt; 189 Marsh Wall<br/>\n&gt; London<br/>\n&gt; E14 9SH<br/>\n&gt; Tel: +44 (0)20 7211 0603<br/>\n&gt; Fax: +44 (0)20 7211 0364<br/>\n&gt; Mobile:-----------------------<br/>\n&gt; Internet communications are not secure and therefore CMG UK Ltd does not<br/>\n&gt; accept legal responsibility for the contents of this message.
