Now I&#39;m considering \ncreating a big visible diagram showing the test coverage over time and \nupdating it every week to see if that will incite the team.\n\nI&#39;m thinking of creating a script that will count all public non-test \nmethods with more than 3 lines of code, and all test methods. The \ndiagram would show either the quotient (numberOfTestMethods divided by \nnumberOfBigProductionMethods) over time, or two graphs on top of each \nother, one for each number over time (any suggestions which one would \nbe better?). I would update the diagram every week. The diagram will be \nself explanatory, so I&#39;m not intending to introduce it to the team or \nexplain my motivations unless asked.\n\nReplacing the diagram after a while with a new one with different \ndimensions (longer time period on the x-axis, higher number on the \ny-axis) is probably confusing to observers of the diagram. So I&#39;m \nconsidering checking out older versions from our revision control \nsystem to see how fast the numbers grow and creating a big enough \ndiagram from the start.\n\nDoes anyone have any thoughts or suggestions about doing this any \ndifferent? Is this even a good idea considering that there isn&#39;t an \nabsolute ideal number or quotient (like bug-count where the ideal would \nbe zero)?\n\nDoes anyone already have a script (in sed, Io, Python, or whatever) \nthat will do something like this for Java source code and JUnit tests \nand is willing to share that with me?\n\n\nThanks,\nChristian\n\n\n",
