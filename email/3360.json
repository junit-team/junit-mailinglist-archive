Don&#39;t you normally launch the TestRunner<br/>\nfrom within a VM?<br/>\n<br/>\njava junit.textui.TestRunner<br/>\n<br/>\nbecomes:<br/>\n<br/>\nmyvm junit.textui.TestRunner<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s easy enough to use an &lt;exec&gt; statement in ANT or use ANT&#39;s extension<br/>\nmechanism to have it use a different VM for your unit test target.<br/>\n<br/>\nAre you looking to have the TestRunner run in a different VM from the<br/>\ntestcases? In that case, a good generic mechansim would be to have a<br/>\nTestCaseProxy or some such which causes a test case to be invoked in a<br/>\ndifferent VM. I have had to do something like that in the past for a<br/>\nclient&#39;s project. The TestCaseProxy invoked a set of tests in a remote VM<br/>\nvia RMI. Unfortunately, this was using a different test harness and the<br/>\ncode is not available to me now.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Tue, 27 Nov 2001, Michael Silverstein wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; &lt; at the request of several people, I&#39;m continuing to cross-post.

The thing I didn&#39;t mention<br/>\n&gt; is that for the purpose of profiling I will be launching the test in an<br/>\n&gt; instrumented VM, so I need to completely override the present test execution<br/>\n&gt; scheme.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; At first blush, one might approach this by implementing a new TestRunner<br/>\n&gt; that launches an instrumented VM, but I would have to do this several times<br/>\n&gt; to support each TestRunner presentation, which is not practical.  That&#39;s why<br/>\n&gt; I proposed a simple decorator, because it requires the least rework of the<br/>\n&gt; existing architecture (simplest thing that could possibly work). Perhaps<br/>\n&gt; once the model and view have been sufficiently separated, the TestRunner<br/>\n&gt; approach will become more practical.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^<br/>\n&gt; Mike Silverstein<br/>\n&gt; SilverMark, Inc.<br/>\n&gt; The object testing company<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.silvermark.com\">http://www.silvermark.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Problem statement<br/>\n&gt; &gt; -----------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I am adding some additional profiling and metrics to JUnit test execution.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; In order to do this I need to plug in to JUnit in such a way as to perform<br/>\n&gt; &gt; some operations before and after test execution, and to extend the test<br/>\n&gt; &gt; results to contain the new metrics. Presently the framework does not allow<br/>\n&gt; &gt; me to do this without altering it.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Process<br/>\n&gt; &gt; -------<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I can either graft a new branch on to the JUnit source tree that contains<br/>\n&gt; &gt; various extensions built in and give it a new name (like JUnit XYZ or<br/>\n&gt; &gt; whatever) or provide some tweaks to the present framework that satisfy my<br/>\n&gt; &gt; needs in the hope they are accepted as part of the next version.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; The purpose<br/>\n&gt; &gt; of this email is to start a discussion about this so that whatever changes<br/>\n&gt; &gt; are necessary fit in with the architectural spirit of JUnit and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; are suitable<br/>\n&gt; &gt; for inclusion in a base release. If possible, I&#39;d like to wrap this up and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; make it publicly available by the end of the year.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Note: I realize test cases are the recognized currency for<br/>\n&gt; &gt; articulating new<br/>\n&gt; &gt; functionality, so once there is agreement in principle to an<br/>\n&gt; &gt; approach, I can<br/>\n&gt; &gt; provide test cases to provide more detail.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Wrapping test execution<br/>\n&gt; &gt; -----------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I need to be able to start profiling immediately before a user test starts<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and end profiling immediately afterward. One approach is to wrap the user<br/>\n&gt; &gt; test class that is presently instantiated in<br/>\n&gt; &gt; junit.runner.BaseTestRunner.getTest(String) with a TestDecorator subclass<br/>\n&gt; &gt; instance that manages profiling during test execution. Creating the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; decorator sounds like a job for factory method [Gamma95].<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Extending the results<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ---------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt; This is presently not easy because all the various test runners<br/>\n&gt; &gt; (subclasses<br/>\n&gt; &gt; of BaseTestRunner) implement their own createTestResult() method,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; where the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; reference to the TestResult class is hard coded. I&#39;d like to be able to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; specify that dynamically as well. This also sounds like a job for factory<br/>\n&gt; &gt; method [Gamma95].<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Toward a unified pluggable configuration approach<br/>\n&gt; &gt; -------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt; A possible approach is to employ the abstract factory pattern [Gamma95]<br/>\n&gt; &gt; where the concrete factory class contains factory methods for the above<br/>\n&gt; &gt; classes and others, is specified in the preferences file or<br/>\n&gt; &gt; elsewhere. This<br/>\n&gt; &gt; sort of architectural change would substantially enable the sort of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; pluggability that I&#39;m after.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Some questions and observations about the framework<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ---------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Having spent some time digging into JUnit I have the following<br/>\n&gt; &gt; questions and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; comments:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; - The preferences file is read in more than one place:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   - junit.runner.BaseTestRunner.readPreferences()<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   - junit.runner.TestCaseClassLoader.readExcludedPackages()<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   I could be wrong but it seems like this is redundant execution,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; especially<br/>\n&gt; &gt; since the preferences is kept in a static variable.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; - The preferences (junit.runner.BaseTestRunner.fPreferences) is static. It<br/>\n&gt; &gt; strikes me that this hampers testability of the framework because it makes<br/>\n&gt; &gt; it difficult to isolate the framework preferences from the preferences for<br/>\n&gt; &gt; instances of framework classes under test.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; - The TestResult class provides semantics for running and stopping tests.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; This seems like a stretch for a results class, which I would imagine is<br/>\n&gt; &gt; primarily a container for execution metrics and other downstream<br/>\n&gt; &gt; information.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; - The TestRunner variants are very tied to presentation layer. I see this<br/>\n&gt; &gt; has been discussed at length in the past so I won&#39;t belabor it.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; - It seems that since all the methods in junit.framework.Assert are static<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and it does not hold any state, there is really no need to make this class<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the root of all tests, except for the convenience of not<br/>\n&gt; &gt; prefixing assertion<br/>\n&gt; &gt; methods with &#39;junit.framework.Assert&#39;. I&#39;m sure I&#39;m missing<br/>\n&gt; &gt; something here.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; References<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ----------<br/>\n&gt; &gt; [Gamma95] Erich Gamma et al. &quot;Design Patterns - Elements of Rusable<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Object-Oriented Software&quot;, Addison-Wesley, Reading, MA, 1995.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Mike Silverstein<br/>\n&gt; &gt; SilverMark, Inc.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; The object testing company<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.silvermark.com\">http://www.silvermark.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; _______________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Junit-devel mailing list<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Junit-devel@...\">Junit-devel@...</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/junit-devel\">https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/junit-devel</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\">junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
