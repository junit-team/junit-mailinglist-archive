They may use<br/>\n&gt; interfaces when forced to do so by the frameworks, but they don&#39;t like<br/>\n&gt; it; and they certainly don&#39;t make it the first choice in their own code.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I do, by the way, seem to leave behind clients, some of whom do a very <br/>\ngood job of carrying on the practices I teach them.

Infrastructure-related service classes <br/>\n(persistence, authorization), though, are typically good candidates for <br/>\ninterfaces, even if business-related service class are less so.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo it&#39;s true that most classes simply do not need more than one <br/>\nimplementation. I don&#39;t extract interfaces from most of the classes I write.<br/>\n<br/>\nTake care.<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJ. B.
