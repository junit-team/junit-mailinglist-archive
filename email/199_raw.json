A single application method invocation often has multiple effects\n&gt; &gt; that need several assertions to test - no matter\n&gt; &gt; which assertions fail, the same piece of functionality (or chunk of\n&gt; &gt; application code) needs to be fixed.  I imagine this\n&gt; &gt; is a fairly common scenario but that it doesn&#39;t normally generate\n&gt; &gt; too many assertions.\n\n\n\n",
