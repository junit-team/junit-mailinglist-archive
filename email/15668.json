When developing within an IDE by all means use the IDE&#39;s unit<br/>\n&gt; &gt; test facilities for the classes being worked on at that point.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; An example perhaps. When developing in, gasp, Eclipse, I will create<br/>\n&gt; &gt; both an object and it&#39;s test simultaneously. I will run the test using<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Eclipse&#39;s JUnit GUI test runner. So, at the object (and it&#39;s test)<br/>\n&gt; &gt; level, I actually do think you should run the tests inside the IDE.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; (Again, this assumes you are an IDE user. Most of the time I am not.)<br/>\n&gt; &gt; But, once you are testing at the project level, running suites of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; tests, I strongly recommend being outside the IDE. My reasons for this<br/>\n&gt; &gt; are many; but the big hitters are that it enables you to run the full<br/>\n&gt; &gt; test suite away from the developers and thus avoid disturbing them, it<br/>\n&gt; &gt; avoids any dependencies upon libraries on the developers machines and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; it enables you to run the builds and tests on a nice big and fast Unix<br/>\n&gt; &gt; machine that your IDE of choice may not be available for. We are in<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the process of bringing in CruiseControl and will be running it on a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Solaris box. Our corporate IDE (name withheld to protect the lame)<br/>\n&gt; &gt; will not run on Solaris, but CC and Ant and JUnit will.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Easy huh?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Simon<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Simon:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Why not have it both ways?  In my latest projects, I have a test suite<br/>\n&gt; that runs &quot;all fast tests&quot; in under a minute; very useful when just<br/>\n&gt; running one or two test cases doesn&#39;t cover all your changes.<br/>\n&gt; However, the build also runs completely independant on build machine<br/>\n&gt; via ant, which isn&#39;t very hard to do if you just get it working from<br/>\n&gt; the start.  So you can get the CI and all that brings with it, plus<br/>\n&gt; the feedback on a local developer&#39;s IDE before they check in.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I think that working on one object and one test at a time is enough. I<br/>\nsuspect that the effort to create a suite for each object you work on<br/>\nwould get tedious. If you&#39;re working on a highly connected object, it<br/>\nwould be better to refactor it rather than cater to it.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nwww.simonpeter.com<br/>\nuab.blogspot.com</div>",
