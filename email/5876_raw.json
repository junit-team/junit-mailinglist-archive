I have tested the JBuilder TestRunner and it \nworks fine with JUnit 3.8, becuase JBuilder uses TestSuite to load the \ntests, just like the other test runners in JUnit.\n\nIf you want to upgrade, there are two ways to do it:\n1. Create a library for JUnit 3.8 (you can call it JUnit 3.8 so that the \nname doesn&#39;t conflict), then add this library as the FIRST required \nlibrary for your project.\n2. Modify the existing JUnit library in JBuilder.  You can either change \nthe library definition (make it pointing to the new library), or \noverwrite the existing junit.jar and src.jar in JBuilder with version 3.8\n\nShane\n\ndirkschreckmann wrote:\n\n&gt;Thanks for the reply.\n&gt;\n&gt;I think that in order to do the upgrade, Borland needs to distribute \n&gt;a new version of their JBuilder TestRunner application.  \n&gt;\n&gt;I was just curious if perhaps it were simpler.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt;junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; \n&gt;\n&gt;Your use of Yahoo!
