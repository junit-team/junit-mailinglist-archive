They only document the<br/>\nset of <br/>\nthe API that the authors chose to test, and they only test to the<br/>\nauthors&#39;<br/>\ndegrees of comfortability.  Truth be known, just because JUnit is in use<br/>\ndoes<br/>\nnot mean that the code is being tested thoroughly.  Right?  You may be<br/>\nright<br/>\nthat it could show you what isn&#39;t tested, but not necessarily why.  And<br/>\nit only<br/>\ngives you a clue as to what is not tested and what is.  There may not be<br/>\na one<br/>\nto one mapping of the public API to the tests.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">   &gt; Heck, i&#39;d be happy if vendors would ship a set of tests to run on<br/>\n </span></blockquote>their<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">   &gt; software in an actual customer environment, just to catch known<br/>\n </span></blockquote>problems<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">   &gt; (such as conflicts and naming issues).
