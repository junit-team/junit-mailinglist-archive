The trick is *not* to just move the method as is to a different\n&gt; class and make it public.\n&gt; \n&gt; The trick is to refactor it so that it moves to a different class\n&gt; where it *should* be public. And in my experience, that&#39;s very\n&gt; likely always possible, in a way that makes the design more flexible\n&gt; and the behaviour more reusable.\n&gt; \n&gt; Does that sound reasonable?\n\n&quot;Let us redefine progress, to mean that just because we /can/ do a\nthing, it does not necessarily follow that we /must/ do that thing.&quot;\nSo I suppose it would depend on several factors. \n\n1. Are you doing this /just/ so that you can test the method by\nexternal invocation? If so then my answer is no.\n2. Is the method already tested through the public API of the class?\nIf yes then my answer is no.\n3. Does the system (code plus tests) clearly communicate everything\nthat needs to be communicated at this time? If it does then my answer\nis no.\n4. Is the flexibility and reusability that you refer to needed now or\nis it speculative? If the latter then my answer is no.\n5. Was my answer no to the previous questions and there are more\nstories needing to be implemented this iteration? Then heck no!\n\n:-)\n\nRegards,\nJim\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
