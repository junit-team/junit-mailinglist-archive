If you\n&gt;  &gt; implement me, you&#39;d better pass my Contract Tests, or you don&#39;t really\n&gt;  &gt; implement me. If the above example were really important, there&#39;d be \n&gt; a test.\n&gt; \n&gt; That&#39;s a good idea, and if I&#39;d ever seen it done in practice I might be\n&gt; more willing to accept it. In fact,. I have never once seen an interface\n&gt; based API that came with a set of tests implementations were required to\n&gt; pass. This includes major APIs shipped by organizations like JavaSoft\n&gt; and the W3C, not just internal corporate work and open source hacking.\n\nIf I hadn&#39;t had a disk failure last year, you&#39;d be able to see an \nexample or two, but I did, so you can&#39;t.\n\n&gt; Of course, I&#39;ve never looked at your codebase. Given that you do this, I\n&gt; suspect your code is likely more robust and reliable than what i see out\n&gt; there, which doesn&#39;t really surprise me. It&#39;s long been known that a\n&gt; small percentage of programmers are vastly more productive than most\n&gt; programmers are. I suspect the programmers who hang out on mailing\n&gt; lists, attend conferences, write and read articles, and so forth tend to\n&gt; be in the more productive group. However, these are not the majority of\n&gt; working developers, and realistic API design has to work for the\n&gt; majority of client programmers, not just the top 10%.\n\nAgreed. I would rather work to fix the programmers. It&#39;s the idealist in \nme. What if a majority of client programmers knew to look for Contract \nTests?\n-- \nJ. B.
