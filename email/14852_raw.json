Can I easily tell with which parameter it&#39;s breaking? \n\nWhat do you think of J. B. Rainsberger&#39;s suggestion of adding a test \nname to each set of parameters?  Would that address these concerns?\n\n&gt; and\n&gt; can I easily debug just that case?\n\nOne advantage of the JUnit 4 syntax is that it&#39;s possible to think of \nIDE test runtimes being able to debug a single test case from the \nparameters, whereas I can&#39;t imagine how to make Eclipse do this with \nJUnit 3 parameterized test cases.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; One of the things I like about the current JUnit 3 non-parameterized\n&gt; approach is that when something does fail, I can immediately reproduce\n&gt; it to step through in a debugger. \n\nThis certainly shouldn&#39;t be seen as a replacement of any \nnon-parameterized JUnit 3 tests.  The goal, which I could have stated \nmore usefully up front, was this: JUnit 4, out of the box, does not \nprovide a dynamic test-suite building mechanism such as that provided by \nthe static suite() method in JUnit 3.  One reason to use suite() is to \ndynamically build a set of TestCase objects that implement the \nParameterized Test Case pattern (see _JUnit Recipes_, recipe 4.8).  \nJUnit 4 does not provide a suite() mechanism, so the JUnit developers \nwould like to find an alternate way to accomplish the same goal in JUnit 4.\n\nThe common case in JUnit 4 will be non-parameterized tests, just as it \nwas in JUnit &lt; 4.\n\n    David Saff\n\n",
