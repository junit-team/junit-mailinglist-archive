I missed that part.\n\n\n&gt; Notes :\n&gt;    - at their current pace, they produce about 1 major release/year.\n&gt;    - last year, for Easter, and Christmas, it was possible to buy\n&gt;      personal licenses for 200$. There is much hope they will keep\n&gt;      this good habit.\n\nMy company pays, so the personal license isn&#39;t valid for me. But then I \ndon&#39;t care too much, because my company pays...\n\n\n&gt;      Or $0, if you don&#39;t need/wish to upgrade.\n\nThe only thing crazier than not using IDEA (or Eclipse perhaps) is \nusing an old version!\n\n\nErik\n\n\n",
