I&#39;ve noticed several similarities between the \nframework I built and JUnit and I plan to port this framework on top of \nJUnit, now I&#39;ve got some questions on the nature of JUnit that I didn&#39;t \nneed to know until now.\n\nIs the number returned by Test.countTestCases() binding? I ask because my \ncheck framework can&#39;t tell in advance how many checks it will have to do \n(it could but that would increase development effort quite a lot, and I&#39;d \nlike to avoid that). Do current TestRunners depend on a pre-defined \nstructure of the test? Another difference of my check framework to JUnit \nis that checks may again initiate checks (they provide an object to be \ntested and a central instance decides which tests to run on this object).\n\nAnyone got any ideas on the general design of such a beast or knows wether \nsuch a thing was already attempted on top of JUnit?\n\nregards\nJoachim Sauer\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\n",
