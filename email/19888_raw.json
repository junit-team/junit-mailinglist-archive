In particu=\r\nlar,\n&gt; &gt; the idea to &quot;do the simplest thing that can possibly work&quot; can be\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; dangerous, because sometimes, you just know where your code is going\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; and it&#39;s safe to start doing things that might not necessarily be the\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n simplest thing at the moment but that will save you time in the near\n&gt; &gt; f=\r\nuture.\n&gt;\n&gt; But sometimes I am confused with the idea to &quot;do the simplest th=\r\ning\n&gt; that can possibly work&quot;. I lost my judgement on what is the simplest\n=\r\n&gt; thing that can possibly work,just as mentioned in this discussion.\n&gt;\n&gt; Ho=\r\nw to get good judgement?I think I no choice but more and more\n&gt; learning an=\r\nd practice.\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks.\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\n\n\n-- \n------------------------------------=\r\n-------------------\nJoakim Ohlrogge\nAgical AB\nV=E4sterl=E5nggatan 79, 2 tr\n=\r\n111 29 Stockholm, SWEDEN\n\nMobile: +46-708-754004\nBlog: johlrogge.wordpress.=\r\ncom\nE-mail: joakim.ohlrogge@...\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message =\r\nhave been removed]\n\n\n",
