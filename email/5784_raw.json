Another is that GJTK can separate data by\ntest, it&#39;s up to you whether that&#39;s important or not. \n\n\nSome of the other features like runtime performance\nare more significant if you also collect coverage at\nhigher levels, integration and systems level testing. \n\n\nTo be honest I don&#39;t know that there would be much of\na speed difference compared to another\ninstrumentation-based solution like Clover, but the\ndifferences are dramatic compared to the JPDA-based\ntools.\n\nI&#39;m not in sales so I guess I&#39;ll leave it at that.  \n;-)  Both tools are readily available for download so\nit&#39;s not hard to try them out and see which works\nbetter for you.\n\nScott\n\n\n--- Eytan Faverman &lt;shmaytan@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Andy,\n&gt; \n&gt; thanks for the info. Clover does seem pretty solid.\n&gt; Wondering how it\n&gt; compares with http://www.testersedge.com/gjtk/.\n&gt; Seems the main\n&gt; difference is that one instruments the byte code\n&gt; while the other\n&gt; instuments the source (since speed of testing is not\n&gt; a huge concern\n&gt; does it really even matter?).\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt; -Eytan\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In junit@y..., &lt;andrew.beacock@n...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Eytan,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; You could try Clover, I have been using the\n&gt; 0.6beta a bit and it seems \n&gt; &gt; to give clear results.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Haven&#39;t tried the 1.0eval yet though.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Their website is quite good, explains what it is\n&gt; all about, and gives \n&gt; &gt; some example outputs for common open-source\n&gt; software.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; http://www.thecortex.net/clover/\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Andy.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --\n&gt; &gt; Andrew Beacock\n&gt; &gt; Principal Software Engineer\n&gt; &gt; Nokia\n&gt; &gt; NMP/MSW/SSP/MMS\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
