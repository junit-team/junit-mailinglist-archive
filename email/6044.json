I&#39;d <br/>\nlike to make the filename configurable, not hardcoded, so that<br/>\nthe test can be run with different inputs.  The test is also more <br/>\nportable this way, with the file not having to have a specific path <br/>\nthat is hardcoded. Anyway, how do I get that argument into JUnit, <br/>\nparticularly when running thru the GUI?  I&#39;ve heard some people say <br/>\nthat the only way to do this is via system properties set at the <br/>\ncommand line invocation of the test runner, but I was hoping there <br/>\nmight be another way.<br/>\n<br/>\nRelated to this, what is the best practice for sharing properties <br/>\namong tests? That is, suppose we were able to get that filename <br/>\nproperty into the test execution - how would all the different test <br/>\ncases know about it?   One way would be for all the TestCases to <br/>\nsubclass some other TestCase subclass that had the filename set on it <br/>\nas a static property.  But this seems a little hacked. Is there a <br/>\nbest practice for this?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\nNoah Green</div>",
