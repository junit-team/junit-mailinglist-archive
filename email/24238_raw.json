I&#39;m trying to understand what actually happens with NUnit. I mark a\n&gt; test as &quot;slow&quot;, and run all of the tests in my project. Are you saying that\n&gt; without selecting the category of tests to run, the IDE doesn&#39;t run the\n&gt; slow tests, that is it only runs tests which are not marked as slow? If\n&gt; this is so, how does it know which are the slow tests?\n&gt;\nIn NUnit, I can mark a test as slow by annotating it [Category(&quot;Slow&quot;)].\nNUnit\nhas no idea what &quot;Slow&quot; means or what to do with it. It&#39;s just a tag. In\norder\nto make use of the category I have to either specify it using a command-line\noption or select it in the Categories window of the NUnit Gui. In either\ncase,\nI can choose to run all tests or just some categories. I can also choose to\nexclude some categories. There&#39;s actually more flexibility at the command\nline than in the Gui, since I can specify boolean combinations of categories\nthere like &quot;Data-Slow&quot;, which means run all the Data category except those\nalso marked as Slow.\n\nHere are differences in the implementations, as I have observed them. It may\nnot be complete and could even be dead wrong in the case of JUnit, so please\ncorrect me if I&#39;m off base:\n\n1. NUnit categories are strings. JUnit&#39;s are classes.\n2. NUnit controls what categories to execute at runtime, without changing\nthe code.\nJUnit requires changing the code or at least setting up suites for each of\nyour commonly\nused categories in advance. I suppose some IDEs may allow runtime selection\nof categories for JUnit.\n\nThese two differences appear to be orthogonal.\n\nRegarding the first difference: I once spent some time considering emulating\nJUnit and using a Type rather than a string to represent a category. Use of\na\nType (class) is more sophisticated and appealed to me at first. In the end,\nI\ncouldn&#39;t really point to an solid advantage to the user, so we still use\nstrings.\n\nRegarding the second difference: Runtime category selection is something\nNUnit users wouldn&#39;t want to do without these days. There seems to be no\nobstacle to allowing it in JUnit while retaining the ability to define\nsuites as now.\nThat&#39;s what I would do...\n\nCharlie\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n",
