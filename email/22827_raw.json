This morning suddenly=\r\n when I run a\n&gt; test class with &quot;Run as JUnit Test&quot;, Eclipse reports &quot;No JU=\r\nnit tests found&quot;.\n&gt;\n&gt; I can still run individual test methods normally. The=\r\n problem happens when\n&gt; I run the test class, and it happens with all test =\r\nclasses in the project,\n&gt; except one. When I run the entire test directory =\r\ntree, JUnit executes one of\n&gt; the classes in the middle of the directory tr=\r\nee normally, then stops with no\n&gt; other messages. I can run that one test c=\r\nlass normally. I can&#39;t find any\n&gt; difference between the one that runs and =\r\nthe dozens that don&#39;t. Other\n&gt; projects continue to run JUnit normally. Ecl=\r\nipse clean, refresh, and\n&gt; validate does not help. Closing and opening the =\r\nproject does not help.\n&gt; Deleting the project from disk and checking it out=\r\n again from my Subversion\n&gt; repository does not help. When I drop back to a=\r\n revision from a few days\n&gt; back, all works correctly. But I want to save a=\r\nnd test my work since then.\n&gt;\n&gt; This sounds like Eclipse metadata got corru=\r\npted, and it sounds like the\n&gt; corrupted metadata gets saved to Subversion.=\r\n I haven&#39;t been able to identify\n&gt; an event or a change in my project that =\r\nled to this problem.\n&gt;\n&gt; What metadata might be involved? If I try deleting=\r\n Eclipse metadata\n&gt; directories, what is safe to throw away?\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks for=\r\n any suggestions.\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\n\n\n-- \nMaybe she awoke to see the roommate&#39;s boyf=\r\nriend swinging from the chandelier\nwearing a boar&#39;s head.\n\nSomething which =\r\nyou, I, and everyone else would call &quot;Tuesday&quot;, of course.\n\n\n[Non-text port=\r\nions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n",
