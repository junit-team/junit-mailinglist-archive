I have a lot of code <br/>\nthat has to reset static state such as caches each time a test is <br/>\nrun, code that is only needed for unit testing. If each test method <br/>\nran in it&#39;s own JVM, my testing code would not require me to make <br/>\nchanges in the code I am testing.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s not just singletons but also caches that should be initialized <br/>\nonce for a JVM. And, honestly, if you think about it, each test <br/>\nmethod SHOULD be atomic. Mock objects seemed kind of like a kludge <br/>\nfor tests not being run atomically.<br/>\n<br/>\nThoughts?<br/>\n<br/>\nR.</div>",
