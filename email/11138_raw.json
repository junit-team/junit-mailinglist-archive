Normally (prior to abbot) I&#39;d dig about my code to\n&gt; locate the appropriate code, create a test case (or cases) to\n&gt; highlight the bug and drive the fix appropriately. Now I have a UI\n&gt; fault that is easy to reproduce - and I&#39;ve created a test case using\n&gt; abbot to highlight the fault, and can now dig through the code and\n&gt; fix it... but... this fault (as with a couple of other UI faults)\n&gt; resolves down to a failing implementation of some DocumentListener\n&gt; logic.\n\n&quot;Real&quot; (complex, non-trivial) UIs have this amazing ability to tease\nout problems with backends :-)\n\n&gt; So should I (would you) keep TDD the fix via the high level UI test\n&gt; case, or drill down and write &quot;lower&quot; level test cases for the\n&gt; DocumentListener implementation. The former helps solve the current\n&gt; bug, the later also fixes the bug but has better coverage of the\n&gt; listener (which could be/is reused)? Or should I duplicate the test\n&gt; to test both the UI working correctly and the listener being\n&gt; implemented correctly? I don&#39;t like the idea of duplication, and I\n&gt; prefer using non UI tool testing (because of the quicker round trip\n&gt; effect), but it seems that I probably do need both tests\n\nFortunately, a rhetorical question:\n\nJonathan Oddy Mon, 7 Jun 2004 16:13:21 +0100\n&gt; Well I&#39;ve settled on the following:\n\n&gt; 1) Keep the UI test (it drives the UI implementation and tests that\n&gt; code from a constrained input perspective).\n\n&gt; 2) Drill down and write specific tests for the underlying logic\n&gt; implementation (if applicable).  In this case it was because the \nunderlying\n&gt; listener didn&#39;t have any test code for it.\n\n&gt; 3) Implement (2) and check the fix (1).\n\n&gt; I&#39;ve chosen this because my current fault *didn&#39;t* have any test\n&gt; code for (2) and when added - I only got a green bar!? So closer\n&gt; inspection of (1) I noted that I was actually wrapping a number of\n&gt; DocumentListeners to get the effect I desired - unfortunately I was\n&gt; add them in the wrong order. \n\nYou might consider\n\n4) expose API to getEffectDesired() and then testGettingEffectDesired\n\n&gt; So whilst (1) on its own would have worked, I like (2) as well\n&gt; because the listener can be used in a number of different ways and\n&gt; (1) only tests a specific usage.\n\nAnother thing to consider: which is more stable, your UI or your\nbackend? If the latter, esp if you expect to expose it more ways in\nfuture (e.g. as a service), you should definitely put more test effort\ninto it--over time you will &quot;spread the overhead.&quot; But if your UI is\nmore stable, and you expect to &quot;forklift-replace&quot; the current backend,\nthen I might not bother.\n\n\n",
