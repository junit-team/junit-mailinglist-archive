I assumed that each of the tests would get the parameters as they are defined in the parameter section, not after they&#39;ve been modified by a previous test method. I&#39;m used to the 3.8 &quot;every test starts out fresh&quot; idea. That isn&#39;t happening. One of the parameters is &quot;new StringBuilder()&quot;. I expected both methods to get an empty StringBuilder. But, the second method is getting the StringBuilder with the contents added in the first method.<br/>\n<br/>\nI tried resetting it in an @After method just to see what happens. The code to set it to a new StringBuilder is executed but the second test method still gets the StringBuilder with the contents added by the first method.<br/>\n<br/>\nIs this the expected behavior?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a>, David Saff &lt;saff@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hmm, that&#39;s odd.
