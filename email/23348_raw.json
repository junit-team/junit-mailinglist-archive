I was thinking of creating an\nissue for this, but wanted to ask first if I&#39;m missing something.\n\nHere&#39;s the motivation: SWTBot includes a runner that automatically saves\nscreenshots on failures. I also wrote a runner that works around Eclipse\nshowing failed assumptions as passed tests. In order to use both, I made\nmy own @MyRunWith annotation. So my test class looks a little like this:\n\n@MyRunWith(SWTBotJunit4ClassRunner.class)\n@RunWith(IgnoreFailedAssumptionRunner.class)\npublic class TestClass {\n...\n}\n\nIgnoreFailedAssumptionRunner is based on ideas from\nhttp://code.google.com/p/programaticallyspeaking/source/browse/DynamicIg&#92;\nnore/src/programmatically/speaking/dynamicignore/RuntimeIgnoreable.java\n&lt;http://code.google.com/p/programaticallyspeaking/source/browse/DynamicI&#92;\ngnore/src/programmatically/speaking/dynamicignore/RuntimeIgnoreable.java&#92;\n&gt; . It creates a delegate runner of the class specified in @MyRunWith.\n\nNow I&#39;d like to use theories or parameterized tests in combination with\nboth SWTBotJunit4ClassRunner and IgnoreFailedAssumptionRunner, but I\ncan&#39;t see how to do this.\n\nThanks,\n\nWilliam Kilian\n\n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n",
