Is there some good way to test multithreaded code that \ndoesn&#39;t invole just waiting a few milliseconds and hoping that a task \nfinished?  I imagine that a better solution might involve calls to \njoin() but tie the unit test closely to the particular implementation.\n\nAnyway, here&#39;s the original question with my current, unsatisfactory \ntest (although it doesn&#39;t have much of the code being tested - I \ndidn&#39;t want to clutter the post.  I should add some.):\n\nhttp://saloon.javaranch.com/cgi-bin/ubb/ultimatebb.cgi?\nubb=get_topic&f=9&t=001390\n\n\n\n",
