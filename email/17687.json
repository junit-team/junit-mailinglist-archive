The library <br/>\n&gt;&gt;supplied by the vendor presented an API that contained only non-virtual <br/>\n&gt;&gt;functions.  The code that used the library could not be tested because <br/>\n&gt;&gt;there was no way to make sure that it was making the right calls. <br/>\n&gt;&gt;    <br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;You&#39;re going to have to elaborate on that case. I don&#39;t doubt you had a <br/>\n&gt;problem, but I don&#39;t understand what it was. How do non-virtual <br/>\n&gt;functions imply that you couldn&#39;t tell  if it was making the right <br/>\n&gt;calls? You say &quot;non-virtual&quot;. Was this a C++ library?<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yes, C++.  We couldn&#39;t introduce mocks for testing.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; I used a DOM parsing <br/>\n&gt;&gt;library a few months ago which, by all appearances, didn&#39;t let you <br/>\n&gt;&gt;create a document in memory.  You had to either point it to a URL or the <br/>\n&gt;&gt;disk.  So, to write tests that could otherwise easily be written in <br/>\n&gt;&gt;memory, you needed either a server or a scattering of files on disk.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;    <br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;That seems OK to me. If the library doesn&#39;t need a means of creating <br/>\n&gt;documents in memory for its own purposes, then it shouldn&#39;t add those <br/>\n&gt;just for testing. Had it done so, you would have used those functions. <br/>\n&gt;However, because it didn&#39;t you tested the code in a more realistic <br/>\n&gt;fashion that is more likely to expose bugs. That&#39;s a good thing.<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Nope.  We wrapped it.  Yes, we had system tests, but in order to test <br/>\nour logic independently, we pretty much had to wrap it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Now if the library had a legitimate need to create documents in memory <br/>\n&gt;for reasons other than testing, then I would add such functions. However <br/>\n&gt;I wouldn&#39;t do it just for testing.<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>The fact is, testing is a legitmate need.  Designing for testability is <br/>\nsimply good engineering.<br/>\n<br/>\nMichael Feathers<br/>\nwww.objectmentor.com</div>",
