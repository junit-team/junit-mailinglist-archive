B. Rainsberger wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt;  &gt; private is not the only way, nor necessarily the best way, to hide\n&gt;  &gt; implementation details. I use interfaces instead.\n&gt; \n&gt; With a lot of care this would work in some situations. If you made the\n&gt; classes the that implemented the interfaces non-public, and provided\n&gt; access to them through some sort of factory, it might work.  It&#39;s more\n&gt; complex but doable. You need to be careful not to expose the\n&gt; implementation classes or people will use them in preference to the\n&gt; interfaces, either deliberately or out of carelessness. If they write\n&gt; their own implementations then you&#39;re virtually guaranteed they&#39;ll code\n&gt; to the class rather than the interface. I see this all the time.\n\nI&#39;m not in the business of using code to protect people from their own \ncarelessness. I provide good documentation in the form of a roadmap, \nsome Javadoc and tests. If, after all that, they insist on being \ncareless or lazy, then they deserve whatever they get.\n\n&gt; The real problem though is that Java is not designed to work this way.\n&gt; Interfaces are not meant to replace classes. In particular, the lack of\n&gt; method preconditions and postconditions means that you can no longer\n&gt; make any promises about what a given method accepts or returns beyond\n&gt; the simple return type. The reason we have access protection as a\n&gt; language feature is because we cannot rely on programmer convention to\n&gt; enforce rules. Using interfaces instead of classes reduces us to using\n&gt; programmer convention to enforce constraints that should be enforced in\n&gt; code. There are languages where preconditions and postconditions are\n&gt; part of the method signature, and in these languages, using interfaces\n&gt; instead of classes is feasible. However, Java is not such a language. :-(\n\nI agree that we cannot always rely on programmer convention to enforce \nrules; but I disagree that access protection is a desired solution, so I \ndon&#39;t use it. Tests help. Other documentation helps. Even so, the market \nfor my APIs doesn&#39;t include the terminally stupid. I realize that&#39;s \nharsh, but it&#39;s how I really feel. If I&#39;m writing code that the rest of \nthe team will use, then I can simply tell them where to look to find out \nhow it works, and be prepared to field questions. If I&#39;m writing code \nthat the rest of the world will use, then I write a roadmap, publish the \ntests and include my e-mail address. It&#39;s working so far.\n-- \nJ. B.
