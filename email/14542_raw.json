Once I have \n&gt; JDK 5, I can try it and see.\n&gt; \n&gt; I hope this helps.\n\nIt does help! A lot...\n\nBoy do I feel stupid.\n\nAll this time I was trying to make everything fit into one class when\nall it took was testing all aspects separately (which is a good\npractice anyway). I&#39;ll have to remember to switch point of views more\noften...\n\nThank you very much for taking some time to answer my questions!\n\nDimitri\n\nPS: This must be the nicest forum/mailing list/community I&#39;ve ever set\nfoot into (and I&#39;ve already received two answers from web\ncelebrities...w00t).\n\n\n\n\n\n",
