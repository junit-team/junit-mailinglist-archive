If no,\nthen with time I will probably end up with tons of warnings when running all\nthe tests for a project. How would I notice if a new one appears? Or an old\none is replaced by a new one that really needs investigation?\n\nPersonnally, I always try to compile code (let&#39;s say C++) with the &quot;warning\nas errrors&quot; option. I wasn&#39;t thinking that way one year ago but a friend of\nmine convinced me. How useful is a warning when lost in between 200 other\nwarnings? How do you keep track of the ones that are ok? What kind of\nknowledge about the code behavior does this show? &quot;I&#39;m not sure what the\ncode does exactly but if it does this if might be ok but still I don&#39;t like\nit&quot; ??\n\nPlease provide an example where this warning() would be useful.\n\nmy 0.02$,\n\nmathieu\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: dror2@...\nTo: junit@yahoogroups.com\nSent: Wednesday, July 25, 2001 7:04 AM\nSubject: RE: [junit] Reporting more then 1 failed assertion per test\n\n\n\nWhat I think is brought up here is a request for &quot;warning&quot; or\n&quot;soft-assertion&quot; level, which is lower than Failure or Error.\nwarn() should have the interface of assert(), except that it does not throw\nan exception, merely count it. It might still create a Throwable object\n(without throwing it), just to have  a stack-trace handy.\n\n\n\n\nVladimir Bossicard &lt;vladimir@...&gt;\n24/07/2001 23:56\nPlease respond to junit\n\n        To:        junit@yahoogroups.com\n        cc:\n        Subject:        RE: [junit] Reporting more then 1 failed assertion\nper test\n\n\n\n&gt; I think it would be useful in certain cases, sort of\n&gt; like &quot;make -k&quot; (keep going if an error is found).\n\nThis is not possible with JUnit because JUnit throws an exception when an\nassertion is not &quot;true&quot;.  When an exception is thrown, &quot;the normal flow of\nthe program is interrupted and that the runtime environment attempts to find\nan exception handler--a block of code that can handle a particular type of\nerror.&quot; (Java Tutorial)  So the next assertion is not executed.\n\nTo &quot;correct&quot; that, you have to change the framework (record the errors and\nthrow an exception at the end of the test method).  But I really don&#39;t think\nthat this will solve problems:\n\n   assertTrue(obj != null);\n  assertTrue(obj.status() == 3);\n\nif obj is null and you evaluate the next assert, the &quot;NullPointerException&quot;\ndoesn&#39;t help much.\n\n-Vladimir\n\n\n\n\n\nTo unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\njunit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n\n\nYour use of Yahoo!
