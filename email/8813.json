Or are you worried<br/>\nabout the object doing what it&#39;s supposed to do when it gets processing<br/>\ntime? I suspect the latter. If so, decouple threading policies from the<br/>\nobject and ignore threads while testing. System tests will test the<br/>\nthreading issues.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On 7/25/03 1:37 PM, &quot;pnjack2001&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:pnjack2001@...\">pnjack2001@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Hi all,<br/>\n&gt; I read a few posts about how to test mutli threaded applications,<br/>\n&gt; however my case is a bit different.<br/>\n&gt; I have an application that when started does some work, and then<br/>\n&gt; spins off several threads that do some more work on the same object,<br/>\n&gt; while the main thread returns to a wait state or process the next<br/>\n&gt; incoming request.<br/>\n&gt; eg. Main application receives some data, process it, and then creates<br/>\n&gt; an object1, creates another thread to work on that object1, and goes<br/>\n&gt; back to process the next incoming message.<br/>\n&gt; Does anyone know how can I unit test this?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Any ideas greatly appreciated<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\">junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
