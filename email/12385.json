If this becomes a problem -- and it isn&#39;t always -- that&#39;s the <br/>\n&gt; point at which I&#39;d start moving tests.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yes, that was my feeling.  My only (slight) worry is that this type of<br/>\nthing happens over time, so there seems to be a risk of &quot;forgetting&quot;<br/>\nthat you&#39;ve got some of these tests somewhere else.  That said if<br/>\nadditional functionality then breaks those tests then I guess (as you<br/>\nsaid) that&#39;s the time to move/change them.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Now it seems that A instantiates B directly, based on your<br/>\n </span></blockquote>description. <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; If that&#39;s true, then I would consider refactoring A to allow me to <br/>\n&gt; inject B into it, and see how the tests would change. Perhaps YAGNI,<br/>\n </span></blockquote>and <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; as you say, you need to spend your time on other things; however, my <br/>\n&gt; designs have always suffered from too /many/ hardcoded dependencies,<br/>\n </span></blockquote>and <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; not too /few/.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Agreed, actually I&#39;ve already done this - so I now have two types of<br/>\ntests for A - those that implicitly use the actual functionality of B<br/>\n(because that&#39;s what it&#39;s supposed to do) and those where I seed the<br/>\nbehaviour of B to allow me to test code flow.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s a struts-based application so these second set of tests allow me to<br/>\ncheck that given certain behaviours of B, A forwards to the relevant<br/>\npage.  I know I *could* do this with struts-unit or some such like, but<br/>\nat the moment I think that is another level of complexity I have yet to<br/>\nget to (and I think it&#39;s too heavy for my current requirement).  I<br/>\ncurrently &quot;get away with&quot; having my Action delegate to some other<br/>\nclass(es) which I TDD, so then what&#39;s left is checking my Action<br/>\nforwards to where I want it to go to given some stimulus...<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks<br/>\n<br/>\nJonathan</div>",
