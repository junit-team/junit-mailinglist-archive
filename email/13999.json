However, one of our goals in JUnit 4<br/>\n&gt; was to remove the recursive composition of tests. It is<br/>\n&gt; difficult to explain and difficult to support properly in<br/>\n&gt; test runners. What I need is an example of JUnit 4-style<br/>\n&gt; dynamic test case creation.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Man; I&#39;ve been cursing JBuilder for several years for its complete <br/>\nlack of &#39;suite&#39; method support!  I can do data-driven tests without <br/>\nit, but doing so pretty much destroys the value of Assert methods; I <br/>\nmust dump all the failures to System.err, and fail a summary.<br/>\n<br/>\nExamples:<br/>\n<br/>\nSay I&#39;m writing a few &quot;sort&quot; routines, to be used in different <br/>\ncases.  Let&#39;s start with a simplistic bubble sort.  I write some <br/>\ntests and get BubbleSort implemented.  Now I want to write an <br/>\nInsertionSort.  First, I&#39;d like to reuse all the existing tests, <br/>\nwith an InsertionSort object.  How can I do this when *THE TOOL* has <br/>\ncomplete control over what tests get run, meaning that I have *NO <br/>\nCONTROL* over it?!?!?<br/>\n<br/>\nPretty much the same story for testing interfaces:<br/>\nI&#39;d like to write a TestCase child class, with all the tests for an <br/>\ninterface.  Then for every implementer, I&#39;ll say &quot;run all the tests <br/>\nin that TestCase class, but use this data (this implementation) for <br/>\ntesting.&quot;  For one thing, this means I&#39;m customizing TestSuite to <br/>\npass parameters to the constructors.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe &quot;suite&quot; method is the escape valve for everything JUnit can&#39;t do <br/>\nby itself.  Don&#39;t take it away from us!</div>",
