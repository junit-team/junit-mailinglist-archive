The user presses<br/>\nbuttons on the UI corresponding to methods on the component to see how the<br/>\nthreads interact with each other and with some blocking structure.<br/>\n<br/>\nA code snippet pane auto-highlights the relevant code as the threads do<br/>\ntheir thing.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe animations are written in Java and each animation is actually controlled<br/>\nby the underlying concurrent component it is illustrating. Therefore it<br/>\ndepicts the true run-time behavior of the component.<br/>\n<br/>\nI invite you to download the application, which is now hosted on SourceForge<br/>\nas an Open Source project.<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sourceforge.net/projects/javaconcurrenta/*&lt;\">http://sourceforge.net/projects/javaconcurrenta/*&lt;</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sourceforge.net/projects/javaconcurrenta/\">http://sourceforge.net/projects/javaconcurrenta/</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI would greatly welcome any feedback from this list.<br/>\n<br/>\nMuch thanks<br/>\nVictor Grazi<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",
