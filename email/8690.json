Therefore, you are not testing that the connection to the database or the that the database actually works - we assume they do because they are out of our scope. This of course assumes you are not writing your own JDBC driver.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was pointed to using mock objects and the like; however what I ended up doing is using setup to run scripts that put specific information into the database to test conditions that I wanted - in essence juicing the data to test the handling of that data under a limited number of conditions.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nChip<br/>\n-----<br/>\nProgramming: Its not just a job - its an indenture <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Patel, Rakesh [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:rakesh.patel@...\">rakesh.patel@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Thursday, July 17, 2003 12:48 PM<br/>\nTo: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a>&#39;<br/>\nSubject: [junit] JUnit, Ant and databases<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHi,<br/>\n<br/>\nwhat is the best way to verify database updates in the db? I really do not<br/>\nwant to write jdbc code in the the JUnit cases if i can avoid it.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe got round the issue of running specific sql scripts in the<br/>\nsetUp()/tearDown() methods by calling Ant programmatically with a buildfile<br/>\ncontaining the required code. Works really well and means we can use Ant<br/>\nfunctionality in our test cases.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks<br/>\n<br/>\nRakesh<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nTo unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\">junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nYour use of Yahoo!
