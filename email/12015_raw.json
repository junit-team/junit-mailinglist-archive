Then your tests\n&gt;  &gt; instantiate different class loaders and hands them in. I don&#39;t know\n&gt;  &gt; class loading that well, so could it work?\n&gt; \n&gt; Unfortunately not - in general, the components don&#39;t control their\n&gt; loading.\n\nOh, so this isn&#39;t a case where something is loading these classes \nthrough reflection, but rather, they just happen to be loaded by \ndifferent class loaders. Understood.\n\n &gt; Timothy is correct, this is a difficult problem, and the best\n&gt; way may in fact be to isolate the classes appropriately if possible.\n&gt; One of the things I was hoping to check was packaging errors, where a\n&gt; class that the client needs is only loaded from the client jars even\n&gt; though the server jars have them as well. I had hoped this was a\n&gt; common problem that others had solved (and might be in your book), but\n&gt; apparently not.\n\nWell, you&#39;re the first person I&#39;ve heard in four years try to do this. \nMaybe now that all the &quot;easy stuff&quot; is written down, we&#39;re becoming more \ndaring. You&#39;re a pioneer! :)\n-- \nJ. B. Rainsberger,\nDiaspar Software Services\nhttp://www.diasparsoftware.com :: +1 416 791-8603\nLet&#39;s write software that people understand\n\n",
