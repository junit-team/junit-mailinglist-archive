I can&#39;t envision a single pr=\r\noject that big. I&#39;d \n&gt; want to ask the people on that project two questions=\r\n:\n&gt; \n&gt; 1. Why such reliance on slow tests?\n&gt; 2. Should we break this up int=\r\no about four subprojects?\n\nGood questions.  I&#39;d give you my own answers, bu=\r\nt I doubt \nthey are too interesting to this group, and they&#39;re definitely\nf=\r\nar off topic of the conversation about how to group tests\ntogether.\n\n&gt; Is i=\r\nt really a good idea to have a test suite so long that \n&gt; you can&#39;t run it =\r\novernight between when people leave for work \n&gt; and when they come back in =\r\nthe morning? How do you do a daily build?\n\nWe have several test suites.  Th=\r\ne unit tests run every night\nand give one level of confidence.  And then so=\r\nme system test\nsuites run each night to give more confidence about differen=\r\nt\nthings each night.  In total, it takes 2 nights, but there is\nusable feed=\r\nback each night.\n\n&gt; No question there. If you&#39;ve managed to reduce the feed=\r\nback \n&gt; cycle from 6 weeks to 2 days, then that&#39;s great work. Still, \n&gt; I f=\r\nind a 2-day cycle quite long. I imagine you have bigger \n&gt; problems to face=\r\n right now, so you&#39;re right to face them and \n&gt; not this one, but all thing=\r\ns being equal, I wouldn&#39;t be \n&gt; satisfied with a 2-day cycle, and I certain=\r\nly wouldn&#39;t design \n&gt; JUnit to optimize for the case of the 2-day test cycl=\r\ne.\n\nYes, that&#39;s one reason I don&#39;t think my own stories are\noverly relevant=\r\n.  I&#39;m not in the &quot;sweet spot&quot; of users\nof JUnit, as I&#39;m using it for both =\r\nunit tests and for\nsystem tests.  And, while I know there are other people\n=\r\nin my same boat, we&#39;re in the minority.\n\n&gt; But that&#39;s great work. I&#39;m impre=\r\nssed. Have you written about \n&gt; what you do differently between the 6-week =\r\ncycle and the \n&gt; 2-day cycle?\n\nOnly on my resume.  :-)\n\n\nTodd.\n\n",
