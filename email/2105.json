If it is interesting to know how<br/>\n&gt;many test cases the system has passed, then it is also interesting to know how many<br/>\n&gt;asserts have made it. This is especially true if a test case is something like testMethod(),<br/>\n&gt;where the individual asserts verify that various values of the parameters to method()<br/>\n&gt;work (max, min, null, normal, etc). Sure these could all be individual test cases, but then<br/>\n&gt;it becomes difficult to see whether I really have exhaustively tested my method. Code<br/>\n&gt;coverage is not the solution. That only tells me whether what I have written, opposed to<br/>\n&gt;what I should have written, works.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Ok imagine JUnit implements the counting of assertions.  You run your <br/>\ntests and get &quot;90 tests, 405 assertions&quot;.  That&#39;s great, but what does <br/>\nthis number &quot;405&quot; tells you?  And what is that better than &quot;90 tests, <br/>\n404 assertions&quot; and worst than &quot;90 tests, 406 assertions&quot;?  Does this <br/>\nmagic number &quot;405&quot; tell you that the &quot;individual asserts verify that <br/>\nvarious values of the parameters to method() work (max, min, null, <br/>\nnormal, etc)&quot;.  Do you expect a certain ration #assertions/#tests?<br/>\n<br/>\nHow does this magic &quot;405&quot; tells you that you have tested what you <br/>\n_should have_ written?  I you don&#39;t know what you should have written, I <br/>\ndoubt that a simple number could tell you that...<br/>\n<br/>\nHere is maybe a good test:<br/>\n<br/>\nvoid setMyValue (int value) {<br/>\n   myValue = value);<br/>\n}<br/>\n<br/>\n[...]<br/>\n<br/>\nvoid testMyValueWithEverything () {<br/>\n   for (int i=INT_MIN; i&lt;INT_MAX; i++) {<br/>\n      myObject.setMyValue(i);<br/>\n      assertTrue(myObject.getMyValue() == i);<br/>\n   }<br/>\n   for (double j=DOUBLE_MIN; j&lt;DOUBLE_MAX; j++) {<br/>\n      myObject.setMyValue(j);<br/>\n      assertTrue(myObject.getMyValue() == Integer(j).toInt());<br/>\n   }<br/>\n}<br/>\n<br/>\nyou have &quot;exhaustively tested [your] method&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe # of assertions will only give you a feeling of security.  A much <br/>\nbetter approach could be to develop a simple framework to stress-test a <br/>\ncomponent but that&#39;s not the goal of JUnit.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Vladimir</div>",
