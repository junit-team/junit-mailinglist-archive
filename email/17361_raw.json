We all know that\n&gt; in the real world, sometimes, other tasks take precedence. Just exercise\n&gt; your judgment, put testing in the backseat when the circumstances warrant it\n&gt; (tight deadline, angry customer, etc...) but always remember to get back to\n&gt; them and pay your technical debt whenever you get a chance.\n\nIndeed. It takes time, but the investment is worth it: for the rest of \nyou life, after you master the basics of programmer testing, you will \nwrite better code, sooner and you&#39;ll spend less time fixing it. It&#39;s great.\n-- \nJ. B.
