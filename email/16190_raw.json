I&#39;d be interested in\n&gt; &gt; any feedback, if people want to suggest additions or improvements.\n&gt; \n&gt; Hm, some of these items seem to be bad ideas. But anti pattern sounds too \n&gt; strong for my taste. \n\nActually, I recently came across the XUnit Test Patterns website at\nhttp://xunitpatterns.com/ . Gerard Meszaros uses the term &quot;Test Smells&quot;,\nwhich probably would be more agreeable to you. However, I&#39;m inclined to\nleave the anti-patterns page at its current location, as it&#39;s getting\nfairly well known at that spot (not that I couldn&#39;t set up a 203\nresponse).\n\n&gt; Anyhow...\n&gt; \n&gt; No unit tests: sounds like saying &quot;you sing wrong because you don&#39;t sing \n&gt; at all&quot;. If I don&#39;t test, I surley do something wrong, but I am not doing \n&gt; unit testing wrong.\n\nYou are right, in that it shows a problem with development methodology,\nand not the tests themselves. That section is meant to have a slightly\nfacetious tone, and possibly doesn&#39;t belong there (I&#39;ve nearly removed\nit a number of times). In the end, I liked the point that it was making,\nbut I probably should consider moving it to a less prominent position.\n\n&gt; I don&#39;t like the section heading &quot;Refactoring&quot; because a refactoring is \n&gt; something different. Your &#39;refactorings&#39; actively change the code and its \n&gt; behavior, while AFAIK a refactoring in terms of THE book doesn&#39;t do that. \n&gt; Maybe &#39;fixes&#39; or &#39;solutions&#39; would be better headings?\n\nYou&#39;re right, in that &quot;refactoring&quot; refers to improving internal\nstructure without changing external behaviour. The anti-patterns page\nrecommends a number of transformations that are in fact refactoring by\nthis definition (e.g. catching unexpected exceptions), but it also\nrecommends a number of changes to existing test behaviour.\n\nIn the end, I was basing the headings on the original anti-patterns book\nby Brown et al, which use the term &quot;Refactored Solution&quot;. Since I\nskipped over most of the other headings anyway, there probably isn&#39;t\nmuch reason to dogmatically stick to that particular heading.\n\n&gt; Missing assertions may be ok, for example in a test that was written for a \n&gt; bug report where the code threw but shouldn&#39;t do so. This test can just \n&gt; have a comment like // This line throws if bug 123 is not fixed.\n\nTrue. In this case, it&#39;s more of a smell, along the lines of if there is\nno assertion, maybe the programmer didn&#39;t understand what they were\ntrying to test. In your example, it is clear what is happening, but I\nhave seen many cases of long meandering tests that didn&#39;t contain any\nasserts. In the end, the test only confirmed that the code didn&#39;t throw\nexceptions, without making any stronger statements about what the\nexpected behaviour should have been.\n\nI think your example hightlights the importance of context in\ndetermining if a particular style of programming is problematic or\nnormal.\n\n&gt; I also don&#39;t have problems with multiple assertions, if it&#39;s only two or \n&gt; three. For example I may assert some object to be not null before \n&gt; asserting its properties.\n\nYeah, I agree here. JBR gave a good example that explained the logic\nhere more clearly.\n\n&gt; Superficial coverage: this can happen for TDD beginners, and unless there \n&gt; is a requirement to check something not on the happy path, I wouldn&#39;t \n&gt; make this a hard rule. For example, if I write tests that deal with \n&gt; people&#39;s age (as an integer), I see no problem with not testing negative \n&gt; values, if the code is used in a context where this is other classes \n&gt; responsibility.\n&gt; \n&gt; An example for the &quot;only easy tests&quot; section would be helpful.\n&gt; \n&gt; I agree on the overly complex tests. However, you may not always be able \n&gt; to just refactor as you&#39;d like.\n&gt; \n&gt; You could add time/date and randomness to the external dependencies.\nNice ones.\n\nThanks for your comments.\n\nCheers!\n-- \nJoe Schmetzer .:.
