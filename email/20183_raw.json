I learned that TDD is one best approach to address this\niss=\r\nue, but I still feel the root cause lies in re-factoring my code,\nso the TD=\r\nD isn&#39;t helping me much here. Can you suggest any links or\narticles where I=\r\n can find more details about re-factoring techniques ? \n\nThanks for your su=\r\nggestion. \n\nSarat kumar.   \n\n--- In junit@yahoogroups.com, Kamlesh Kumar &lt;k=\r\namlesh.kumar@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi edu_kumar,\n&gt; \n&gt; You can injected your expec=\r\nted values to those private \n&gt; variables using reflection from your testcas=\r\ne method. \n&gt; Then your testcase should work properly.\n&gt; \n&gt; Good Luk\n&gt; Kamle=\r\nsh Kumar\n&gt; Insurance SBU, Pune.\n&gt; L&T Infotech Ltd.\n&gt; Tel: (O)(91)-20-6641 =\r\n6262 ext. 6138\n&gt; Email: kamlesh.kumar@...\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Larsen & Toubro Infotech =\r\nLtd.\n&gt; www.Lntinfotech.com\n&gt; \n&gt; This Document is classified as: \n&gt; \n&gt; L&T I=\r\nnfotech Proprietary   L&T Infotech Confidential   L&T Infotech \n&gt; Internal =\r\nUse Only   L&T Infotech General Business \n&gt; \n&gt; This Email may contain confi=\r\ndential or privileged information for the \n&gt; intended recipient (s) If you =\r\nare not the intended recipient, please do \n&gt; not use or disseminate the inf=\r\normation, notify the sender and delete it \n&gt; from your system. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\n&quot;edu_kumar&quot; &lt;sarat.beesa@...&gt; \n&gt; Sent by: junit@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; 12/21/200=\r\n7 04:31 PM\n&gt; Please respond to\n&gt; junit@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; To\n&gt; junit@y=\r\nahoogroups.com\n&gt; cc\n&gt; \n&gt; Subject\n&gt; [junit] Ideas for testing large methods.=\r\n.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Hi all, \n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;ve been stuck with a problem=\r\n, when i&#39;m unit testing my code. \n&gt; \n&gt; My problem is that i&#39;ve a really hug=\r\ne method,which calls several small\n&gt; methods ( methods so small, they&#39;re ju=\r\nst getters for member\n&gt; variables), If i have to unit test this method, i&#39;v=\r\ne to make sure all\n&gt; the small methods that it subsequently invoke, work as=\r\n they&#39;re\n&gt; expected. But all my member variables get initialized seperately=\r\n in a\n&gt; different method which is of no relation with the BIG method I want=\r\ned\n&gt; to test in the first place. \n&gt; \n&gt; Can I test my method without worryin=\r\ng about the initialization of my\n&gt; object&#39;s data, by mocking the results of=\r\n all my getter methods ? \n&gt; \n&gt; Ex: \n&gt; \n&gt; Class MyClass\n&gt; {\n&gt; private Object=\r\n _member; \n&gt; public void initialize()\n&gt; {\n&gt; //huge initialization process, =\r\nwhich initializes my member\n&gt; variables. \n&gt; _member =3D new Object(); \n&gt; }\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; public void myHugeMethod()\n&gt; {\n&gt; //.. my logic here.\n&gt; Object m =3D ge=\r\ntMember(); \n&gt; //... proceed with this value. \n&gt; }\n&gt; \n&gt; public Object getMem=\r\nber()\n&gt; {\n&gt; return this._member; \n&gt; }\n&gt; }\n&gt; \n&gt; Now, if I call &#39;myHugeMethod=\r\n()&#39; without calling &#39;initialize()&#39; method,\n&gt; it always return NULL. \n&gt; \n&gt; A=\r\nll i wanted to do is to test &#39;myHugeMethod()&#39;, by mocking\n&gt; &#39;getMember()&#39; m=\r\nethod and setting the result what i wanted. \n&gt; \n&gt; I tried using Jmock for c=\r\nreating mocks in my test case, but it fails\n&gt; because the mock object only =\r\nknows what exactly I wanted to mock but\n&gt; nothing more than that. All my ap=\r\nplication logic is present in\n&gt; &#39;MyClass&#39; object not in its mock. \n&gt; \n&gt; How=\r\n can I achieve this using Jmock ? \n&gt; \n&gt; FYI, I tried with a direct approach=\r\n by extending &#39;MyClass&#39; and\n&gt; overriding the &#39;getMember()&#39; method in it. Bu=\r\nt I still feel there&#39;s a\n&gt; better way to do it. \n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;ll be very thankful=\r\n for any help in this regard.. \n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks in advance, \n&gt; Sarat kumar. \n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt;  \n&gt; ____________________________________________________________________=\r\n__\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ________________________________________________________________=\r\n______\n&gt; \n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt;\n\n\n\n",
