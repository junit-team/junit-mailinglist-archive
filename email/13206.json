But in a different case, <br/>\nwhen SOAP message sent over JMS is used in the XML, the server side <br/>\nTIBCO BusinessWorks process does not accept XML input. Error msg<br/>\nsays: there was error deserialising/processing SOAP message. What <br/>\ncould be the reason? This SOAP over JMS message was taken off from<br/>\nthe queue using queuebrowser and pasted in TextPad text editor and <br/>\nsaved as XML file. I suspect, in this procedue, something is causing <br/>\nproblem, and this SOAP/XML is rejected by the TIBCO process.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have spent over a week breaking my head over it. Any help will be <br/>\ngreatly appreciated.<br/>\nPLEASE HELP.<br/>\n<br/>\nVictor</div>",
