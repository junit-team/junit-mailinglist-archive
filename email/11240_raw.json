It is the low-level host \n&gt;protoco=\r\nl I need to test. The difficulty is that the device on the \n&gt;other end is o=\r\nften experimental and I cannot rely on perfect \n&gt;operation and documentatio=\r\nn. I could try to take the high road and \n&gt;expect perfection from the manuf=\r\nacturer, but that is not how things \n&gt;work in my world :). What I am writin=\r\ng is a set of software drivers \n&gt;controlling devices from different manufac=\r\nturers. I am trying to \n&gt;provide consistent interface to a class of hardwar=\r\ne modules, all \n&gt;with a twist and all of them with vastly different protoco=\r\nls. \n&gt;Mocking the hardware will not help me much. It will be a waste of \n&gt;t=\r\nime trying to duplicate (and some times guess) all aspects of the \n&gt;behavio=\r\nr, when I can simply plug it in. In effect I am testing more \n&gt;the host pro=\r\ntocol and the device then the business logic on my end. \n&gt;Again, I am devel=\r\noping a driver, not the business logic that will \n&gt;use that driver.\n\nOur sy=\r\nstem communicates with PLCs (Programmable Logic Controllers) and we also ha=\r\nve to accept protocols dictated to us by engineers. These protocols could e=\r\nasily change as they try to swap out one brand of PLC and replace it with a=\r\nnother. So, we wrote a very thin listener, that extracted the data we neede=\r\nd, loaded up a value object and passed it into the main body of our system.=\r\n You can&#39;t test/mock/control everything, but you can certainly create some =\r\nvery definite boundaries and test everything inside.\n\n&lt;snip&gt;\n\n&gt;3. It crosse=\r\nd my mind to put everything into one test method and \n&gt;call the individual =\r\ntest methods from there, but I do not like this \n&gt;approach. It invalidates =\r\nin my opinion many of the benefits of \n&gt;JUnit. \n\nI don&#39;t follow you here. J=\r\nUnit provides a framework for testing. Some tests are very simple, some tes=\r\nts are more complex, just because of the initial setup required before gett=\r\ning to the meat of the test. This is not JUnit&#39;s fault. To repeat JB and Mi=\r\nke Clark, if something is difficult in JUnit, it&#39;s a hint that you need to =\r\naddress something.\n\n&lt;snip&gt;\n\n&gt;&gt; No, it isn&#39;t. Still, whenever I want to do s=\r\nomething in my design \n&gt;that \n&gt;&gt; JUnit makes difficult, it is /usually/ a s=\r\nign that my design needs \n&gt;&gt; Improvement.\n&gt;\n&gt;5. I do not agree entirely wit=\r\nh the above. My concern was related to\n\nI&#39;m sorry you don&#39;t agree, in pract=\r\nice I have found this to be so true that it&#39;s not even funny (to use a Brit=\r\nishism).\n\n&gt;the fact that I see no way to control the flow in JUnit and it h=\r\nas \n\nThink about why you want to control the order of flow? Do you _really_=\r\n need to control the flow? I used to think so, and would create Suite objec=\r\nts to allow me to do just that, but now, as long as I can make each of my t=\r\nests independent, then it doesn&#39;t matter at all what order they run in.\n\n&gt;v=\r\nery little to do with the design of the system being tested - good \n&gt;or bad=\r\n. As far as I understand test framework should perform well \n&gt;even if the c=\r\node it works with is bad (I hope this is not the case \n&gt;with mine J). I sti=\r\nll consider this ability (flow control) \n&gt;completely missing in JUnit.  I t=\r\nhink it would be very useful if I \n&gt;could have explicit control over what t=\r\nests execute when and even \n&gt;branch the logic based on a condition. Perhaps=\r\n jump from one test to \n&gt;another, etc. On the other hand I do not like the =\r\nunderlying \n&gt;suggestion that one should be dependent on the specific capabi=\r\nlities \n&gt;of any one testing framework. In a way, to design for JUnit. Test =\r\n\n&gt;tools come and go and the merits of the design should be judged not \n&gt;by =\r\nhow easy is to use with JUnit, but how it performs.\n\nPerhaps the issue here=\r\n is not that JUnit will not meet your unit testing needs, but rather that p=\r\nerhaps the testing needs you are describing here are actually functional te=\r\nsting needs. This would explain why you are so keen on sequences and condit=\r\nional branches. At this point you may well be better advised to consider a =\r\nnon-JUnit based solution. JMeter leaps to mind as an option.\n\n&gt;The bottom l=\r\nine is that I found a solution that works. Thanks for \n&gt;all the good sugges=\r\ntions.\n\nGood suggestions is what we do best around here. :-)\n\nSimon\n\n------=\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------\nSimon P.
