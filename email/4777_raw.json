This doesn&#39;t lend \nwell to functional tests, though, which usually have much more complex \nsetup and configuration steps that need to interleave the individual \ntests.\n\nOn Saturday, April 27, 2002, at 06:03 PM, dvydra2 wrote:\n\n&gt; Kent,\n&gt;\n&gt; I agree with your position, however I am at a new job and there is an\n&gt; existing body of tests that we would like to run within the JUnit\n&gt; framework. These tests lean more towards being functional tests and\n&gt; rely on multiple failures being handled correctly. There have been\n&gt; several opinions on this list in support of multiple failures for\n&gt; functional tests.\n&gt;\n&gt; What I would like to know is the reason TestCase inherits from Assert\n&gt; rather than delegates to it. If it delegated, we could subclass\n&gt; TestCase to handle multiple failures and still use Assert for DbC.\n&gt;\n&gt; Regards,\n&gt;\n&gt; David\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In junit@y..., &quot;kentlbeck&quot; &lt;kentbeck@c...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt; When I&#39;ve wished for multiple failures to be recorded in my tests,\n&gt; my\n&gt;&gt; tests were always too big. Splitting up the tests gave me more\n&gt;&gt; satisfactory tests, and pinpointed errors.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; If you want multiple failures, it sounds like you want a different\n&gt;&gt; mechanism than fail().\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; The advantage of having the methods be static is that you can do\n&gt; DbC\n&gt;&gt; and have pre-/post-condition failures reported like all other JUnit\n&gt;&gt; failures.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Kent\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
