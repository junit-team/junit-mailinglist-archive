This way one can:\n\n1. Use an alternative third-party annotation, =\r\nsuch as javax.annotation.concurrent.ThreadSafe from libraries like com.goog=\r\nle.code.findbugs:jsr305:1.3.9 and com.google.code.findbugs:annotations:2.0.=\r\n1.\n2. Define a private annotation, without adding _any_ additional dependen=\r\ncy.\n\nI use javax.annotation.concurrent.ThreadSafe quite a lot in my own cod=\r\ne, so (1) is quite important from my perspective. There are precedents for =\r\nthis approach: IIRC, Eclipse does something like this for variations on @Nu=\r\nllable and @Nonnull, whereas (again, IIRC) Findbugs handles two instances o=\r\nf @SuppressWarnings.\n\nCheers,\nStephan\n\n--- In junit@yahoogroups.com, Kevin =\r\nCooney  wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hello, everyone\n&gt; \n&gt; Short version: we are thinking of a=\r\ndding an optional dependency from JUnit\n&gt; to jcip-annotations and are solic=\r\niting feedback.\n&gt; \n&gt; A few people have noticed that when you use ParallelCo=\r\nmputer, you got poor\n&gt; performance because calls to registered RunListeners=\r\n are synchronized. We\n&gt; would like to fix this in the next release of JUnit=\r\n.\n&gt; \n&gt; In order to prevent affecting existing users, we are proposing havin=\r\ng an\n&gt; annotation that can be added to RunListener implementations that can=\r\n safely\n&gt; be called concurrently from multiple threads. If a RunListener pa=\r\nssed to a\n&gt; RunNotifier is not annotated with this annotation, JUnit will w=\r\nrap it with\n&gt; a decorator that does synchronization.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; We would appre=\r\nciate feedback on this new annotation.\n&gt; \n&gt; We have two options:\n&gt; \n&gt; a. Cr=\r\neate our own annotation for this\n&gt; b. Use ThreadSafe (\n&gt; http://grepcode.co=\r\nm/file/repo1.maven.org/maven2/net.jcip/jcip-annotations/1.0/net/jcip/annota=\r\ntions/ThreadSafe.java\n&gt; )\n&gt; \n&gt; The advantages to option b are:\n&gt; \n&gt; 1. It&#39;s=\r\n a well-known annotation\n&gt; 2. Users that use JUnit can add this annotation =\r\nto their thread-safe\n&gt; RunListener implementations today and get the benefi=\r\nts &quot;for free&quot; later.\n&gt; \n&gt; Note we can do this without requiring that all us=\r\ners of JUnit have the\n&gt; jcip-annotations jar in their classpath as of JDK 1=\r\n.5.0_06 (see\n&gt; http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3567413/why-doesnt-a-miss=\r\ning-annotation-cause-a-classnotfoundexception-at-runtime).\n&gt; If jcip-annota=\r\ntions is not on the classpath then all RunListener\n&gt; implementations will b=\r\ne treated as not thread-safe.\n&gt; \n&gt; As a specific example, the Maven Surefir=\r\ne plugin would use this dependency\n&gt; and include jcip-annotations.\n&gt; \n&gt; Cur=\r\nrently, JUnit only depends on one third-party library (Hamcrest). This\n&gt; ha=\r\ns caused us some pain in the past when the Hamcrest code changed in ways\n&gt; =\r\nthat broke existing users of JUnit. We believe this will not be an issue\n&gt; =\r\nwith jcip-annotations because the JAR only contains annotations, not any\n&gt; =\r\ncode.\n&gt; \n&gt; One possible concern would be with other open source libraries t=\r\nhat provide\n&gt; RunListener implementations (they would need to add jcip-anno=\r\ntations to\n&gt; their compile-time classpath if they have thread-safe annotati=\r\nons, and\n&gt; document this to their users).\n&gt; \n&gt; Thoughts?\n&gt; \n&gt; -- Kevin\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt;\n\n\n\n",
