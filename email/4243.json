But it&#39;s maybe because I <br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t stick to this principle.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; In many cases, the simplest thing that works is #ifdef ... #endif (in <br/>\n&gt; C++).  Well I let you imagine how a code may look like after several <br/>\n&gt; years of #ifdef... #endif!<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess the question is what is simple?<br/>\n<br/>\nEasy to implement now or simple to understand? They&#39;re not necessarily the <br/>\nsame thing.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt can come down to making a choice between the two. I suppose in those cases <br/>\nthe best thing to do at the moment is whatever hurts the least. At a certain <br/>\nlevel what&#39;s simplest to implement becomes harder to comprehend.<br/>\n<br/>\nPerhaps a three stage refactoring should occur when one feels the urge to <br/>\ncreate a new specialized Assert class for one&#39;s new custom assert <br/>\nresponsibilities.<br/>\n<br/>\n1. First keep the custom assert methods local to your test cases.<br/>\n<br/>\n2. When excessive duplication starts to occur push these responsibilities up into <br/>\na new specialized Test Case base class and sub-class your individual unit test <br/>\ncases from that.<br/>\n<br/>\n3. When these assert methods have proven their usefulness and durability over <br/>\na period of time refactor them out into a new specialized sub-class Assert class <br/>\n(and get rid of the specialized TestCase class) in order to make one&#39;s test code <br/>\na little easier to understand. Or shift these responsibilities to a new sub-class <br/>\nAssert class when other unrelated tests cases could make use of them.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn other words, have these new custom assert methods evolve into a new <br/>\nspecialized Assert sub-class over a series of refactorings. Following the &quot;You <br/>\nAren&#39;t Gonna Need It&quot; principle.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for your advice,<br/>\n<br/>\nAnthony </span></blockquote></div>",
