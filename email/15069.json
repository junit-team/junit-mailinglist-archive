That <br/>\nsaid, many testers and test suites (including myself and my suites, and <br/>\napparently even some of JUnit&#39;s own suites) tend to gravitate toward one <br/>\ntest class per tested class. This is a very common pattern, even if it&#39;s <br/>\none JUnit wasn&#39;t meant to support and one that causes test suites to <br/>\ntake longer to run than they otherwise would.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis does make me wonder if maybe JUnit has been cutting the wrong way <br/>\nall these years. Perhaps it should be designed to organize tests by <br/>\nmodel class rather than fixture. This certainly seems a lot more natural <br/>\nto a lot of developers.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n﻿Elliotte Rusty Harold  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:elharo@...\">elharo@...</a><br/>\nXML in a Nutshell 3rd Edition Just Published!<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.cafeconleche.org/books/xian3/\">http://www.cafeconleche.org/books/xian3/</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0596007647/cafeaulaitA/ref=nosim\">http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0596007647/cafeaulaitA/ref=nosim</a></div>",
