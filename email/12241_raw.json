I have a TestSuite that takes the name of a script as a\n&gt; parameter. That script contains a series of request/response pairs. I\n&gt; dynamically generate a test case for each line in the file and add it\n&gt; to the TestSuite. The name of the TestSuite is the name of the script\n&gt; file so I can distinguish between runs.\n&gt; \n&gt; I run this insisde Eclipse and the TestSuite&#39;s name is correct (i.e.\n&gt; it&#39;s the name of the script) but when I run it using ant with an XML\n&gt; formatter, the name of the test is the name of the class.\n\nIt looks like the XML formatter is making an assumption about the \nTestSuite name. I&#39;m not sure what to do about that, short of looking at \nthe source and deciding it&#39;s incorrect. I think that, objectively \nspeaking, a TestSuite should be named by its name property, and not \nnecessarily its class name.\n\nLook at the Ant task source and see what you can find out. I doubt it \nwould be a difficult fix. TestSuite has a method to return the name, so \nperhaps the XML formatter is not invoking it.\n\n&gt; For the time being I&#39;m going to create a second TestSuite under the\n&gt; main test suite and give it the correct name since all the children of\n&gt; the original have synthetic names and show up find in the generated XML.\n&gt; \n&gt; Is this a known issue? Better workarounds than what i&#39;ve mentioned above?\n\nI&#39;ve never run into it before. I don&#39;t name test suites very often, and \nI&#39;ve been working mostly in Eclipse for the past two years. :)\n-- \nJ. B.
