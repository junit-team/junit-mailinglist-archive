JUnit is a bit off on \nit&#39;s founder&#39;s XP credentials, and part of that seems to be an allergy \nto Maven.  We should be able to release JUnit from a button on a build \nserver :)\n\n\nOn 08/09/2011 22:43, Stefan Birkner wrote:\n&gt; The information about JUnit is across three different places: junit.org, junit.sourceforge.net and github. Additionally some information is missing or very hard to find (new features like rules, current version, how to contribute, ...)\n&gt;\n&gt; I would like to have one site with all the information. This makes it easier to find the information and JUnit would look more professional. IMHO the github pages are a good place for the JUnit documentation, because we can use all the git(hub) features for creating the documentation.\n&gt;\n&gt; What do you think?\n&gt;\n&gt; Stefan Birkner\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
