I know the issues, and I&#39;m not<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; trying to force you to type too much.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Oh, I&#39;m not offended or anything of the sort.  I&#39;m just chuckling that<br/>\n&gt; you and I specifically have discussed this issue before.  I&#39;m a quick<br/>\n&gt; typist, and I ought to be: I have all this practice from documenting<br/>\n&gt; my test methods and assert statements!  :)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Just checking.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  &gt; &gt; Just like the test name often needs further clarification (never pass<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; up an oportunity for documentation), often the reason for the<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; assertion is not self-apparent.  You can try to argue that &quot;it ought<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; to be, or rewrite your code!&quot; but, as before, I think you&#39;re straying<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; too close to the &quot;Java code is self-documenting&quot; argument, which I<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; find ... dubious at best.<br/>\n&gt;  &gt;<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; I don&#39;t know. I just wrote this in an XHTMLUnit test today:<br/>\n&gt;  &gt;<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; assertXpathExists(<br/>\n&gt;  &gt;      somewhereThereIsA(formNamed(&quot;demographics&quot;))<br/>\n&gt;  &gt;      .eventuallyContainingA(textFieldNamed(&quot;firstName&quot;)), document);<br/>\n&gt;  &gt;<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; This translated to the XPath expression<br/>\n&gt;  &gt;<br/>\n&gt;  &gt;      //form[@name=&quot;demographics&quot;]//input[@type=&quot;text&quot; and <br/>\n&gt; @name=&quot;firstName&quot;]<br/>\n&gt;  &gt;<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; Is a comment or a failure message going to make that clearer?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I haven&#39;t had a need for XHTMLUnit, I&#39;m mostly commenting about<br/>\n&gt; vanilla JUnit usage.  That said, what message does the above generate<br/>\n&gt; in your error report?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Roughly speaking:<br/>\n<br/>\nUnable to find xpath: //form[@name=&quot;demographics&quot;]//input[@type=&quot;text&quot; <br/>\nand @name=&quot;firstName&quot;]<br/>\n<br/>\nI realize now that you were aiming for being able to read failure <br/>\nmessages and not code, so my example is inappropriate.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  &gt; I agree and explain &quot;why&quot; in English, but nost of the time, test case<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; class name, method name and line number is enough for me to know what<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; failed, from which I generally can determine why it failed. If not, then<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; my tests are too big (and that&#39;s an entirely different problem).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Do you have the same experience with tests you&#39;re not the author of?<br/>\n&gt; This is where I&#39;ve found it especially helpful, or frustrating if it<br/>\n&gt; doesn&#39;t exist.  Of course *my* logic and reasoning is always obvious,<br/>\n&gt; it&#39;s those other punks that write stuff I can&#39;t understand.<br/>\n&gt; (sarcasm!)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It depends on the size and scope of each test. I am working with a team <br/>\nthat has decided it will not write a single integration test until it <br/>\nreceives a defect report. Until then, it will test each object in <br/>\nperfect isolation from the others. I suspect they&#39;ll get an entire <br/>\nrelease done before they need to do something different.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; These additional comments have also been helpful if I&#39;m debugging a<br/>\n&gt; section I neither wrote, nor studied the original requirements.  An<br/>\n&gt; example of that situation is code written for features implemented<br/>\n&gt; before I joined the proeject.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t doubt they&#39;re helpful, but I would have problems being on a <br/>\nproject and being told, &quot;Thou shalt write failure messages for each <br/>\nassertion.&quot; I think my productivity would go down 30% and I&#39;d probably <br/>\nstart looking for other work. It felt liike you wanted to institute such <br/>\na rule on a project. I merely pointed out that perhaps that strategy, <br/>\nthough safe, is quite less than optimal.<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJ. B.
