After all tests \nof a class have finished I want to perform another thing. Overwriting \ntearDown does not work for this requirement, it occurs too often. \nWhen the last test has finished I want to perform something. But it \nneeds to be within JUnit, not outside of it.\n\nSo I tried to put this inte XyzTestCase. Its easy to perform \nsomething before every test started. I simply put it into a static \nconstructor. But how can I perform something after every test has \nfinished? I tried to overwrite various methods of the upper class \nTestCase, but it didn&#39;t help. They were called too frequently or not \nat all.\n\nCan you please help me?\n\n\n\n",
