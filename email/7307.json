If the fixture includes an expensive database <br/>\n&gt; connection, for example, could that connection not be created by the <br/>\n&gt; first test method and stored in a static variable for all subsequent <br/>\n&gt; test methods to share? Not sure how you could close the connection at <br/>\n&gt; the end of the last test method executed, though. Has anyone used <br/>\n&gt; static variables to share fixture objects among multiple test methods?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I use this technique with a ResourceManager.  To close the connection, you could<br/>\nwork with a TestSetup.tearDown method on the TestSuite level but it&#39;s getting a<br/>\nlittle bit messy IMO.  But since JUnit was not designed to share resources,<br/>\ntricking JUnit to share them is going to be messy anyway.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Vladimir<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nVladimir R.
