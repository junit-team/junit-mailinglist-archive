But in my case I would have a lot of &quot;false warnings&quot; because I<br/>\nhave a lot of methods that validate something and throw if it&#39;s invalid (but<br/>\ndo nothing if valid, so return is void). The tests look like that :<br/>\n<br/>\npublic void testAValidationTest() throws Exception {<br/>\n    validator.validate(VALID_DATA);<br/>\n}<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, no asserts, but a perfectly valid test case.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would then probably get 200 warnings, so how could I differentiate the<br/>\nlegitimate ones from false ones?<br/>\n<br/>\nIf this feature goes in, it should be possible to turn it on/off, like<br/>\nassert counting I guess :)<br/>\n<br/>\nmathieu<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: Keith Ray<br/>\nTo: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a>&#39;<br/>\nSent: Friday, July 27, 2001 12:36 PM<br/>\nSubject: [junit] re - assert counting<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAs I said before, I would just want a warning when a test method is empty or<br/>\nhas no asserts... but I don&#39;t want to go to the trouble of getting some<br/>\ncode-coverage tool working.<br/>\n&gt; I think Jeff has hit the nail on the head, I too would like to be<br/>\n&gt; able to get some feedback when the number of asserts has changed<br/>\n&gt; for the same reasons.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Seems to me that the simplest thing that could possibly work is<br/>\n&gt; to count the asserts.<br/>\nI&#39;m not using the current JUnit, since my old version is doing just fine,<br/>\nwith no class-loader problems because it doesn&#39;t do its own class-loading,<br/>\nand I&#39;ve customized it to write time-per-test information to stdout, etc...<br/>\nEventually I will add the no-asserts warning to my versions of CppUnit and<br/>\nJUnit.<br/>\nDoes the current JUnit have a tree view of test-cases within test-suites<br/>\nwithin other test-suites? If it did, then the lowest-level view of a single<br/>\ntest-case could display the assert count, or perhaps turn some color if<br/>\nthere were no asserts.<br/>\nDid the code that someone wrote to look for TestCase subclasses in specified<br/>\ndirectory hierarchies or jar files, and automatically run them, get put into<br/>\nJUnit or made public?<br/>\n<br/>\nYahoo!
