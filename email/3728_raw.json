You\nrun the tests once and manually verify the output. The verified output\nbecomes the specimen against which future runs are compared.\n\nThis is usually considered functional testing rather than unit testing.\n\nOn Wed, 9 Jan 2002, David V. Olivier wrote:\n\n&gt; I use JUnit for about 90% of my code.  I would like to use it for 100% but\n&gt; I consistently find automated testing of certain types of functionality\n&gt; particular difficult to accomplish.  My work is in digital mapping, and I\n&gt; find complex operations on large data sets problematic.\n&gt;\n&gt; Let me give a specific example:\n&gt;\n&gt; I am currently implementing functionality to warp satellite images from one\n&gt; mapping projection to another.  The image is distorted according to a\n&gt; complex formula.  On a low level, I can test that for a given input my\n&gt; implementation of the formula provides the result I expect, but on a higher\n&gt; level I haven&#39;t been able to automate verification of that the final image\n&gt; is correct.  I have only been able to superimpose the result on a\n&gt; background map I know is correct and eyeball the results.\n&gt;\n&gt; I would be curious to hear feedback from more experienced JUnit users on\n&gt; approaches to testing this type necessarily complex behavior.   I know that\n&gt; Mock Objects are used to simplify the testing of certain types of otherwise\n&gt; problematic scenarios, but I have no first hand experience with them and\n&gt; don&#39;t clearly see their applicability in a case like this.  Have others\n&gt; found that there are certain areas where, in practice, they simply don&#39;t\n&gt; apply JUnit as the ratio of effort to develop the test compared to benefit\n&gt; gained by the test is too high (certainly the issue of testing GUIs has\n&gt; received plenty of attention on this list)?\n&gt;\n&gt; I dislike leaving gaps in my tests, particularly in coverage for the most\n&gt; difficult functionality, as these are the areas most likely to contain bugs.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; David Olivier\n&gt; Naval Research Laboratory\n&gt; Digital Mapping, Charting & Geodesy Analysis Program\n&gt; Code 7440.2\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
