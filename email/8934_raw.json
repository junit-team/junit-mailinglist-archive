The mass of failing tests is\n&gt;\tonly a symptom, and by trying to fix it with Junit, you will only cure\n&gt;\tthe symptom, not the real problem. By solving the real problem, the need\n&gt;\tto change the way Junit works will vanish. In fact, aggravating the\n&gt;\tproblem by letting more tests fail due to a single problem might\n&gt;\tactually *help* you solve the real problem (by making it more visible).\n&gt;\t*If* you do have a process/people problem.\n\nI can see that, for some more stable situations. The situation I had was\nthat I was undertaking a major (major) refactor of some core things that I\ndidn&#39;t consider clean & couldn&#39;t live with. I knew I was going to break some\nmajor things, and was *very glad* I had a large working test suite before I\nstarted it. Being test infected I felt empowered to make the huge change &\nthat junit would help me do it quickly, with damage control, and a\nconfidence at the end that my contracts with the outside world wouldn&#39;t have\nbeen broken.\n\n&gt;\tSo, tell us more about those failing tests?\n\nI broke my core, re-designed it, re-wrote it -- no holds bars I dived in.\nLoved it, felt much better for the refactor. Then it was &quot;clean-up time&quot;,\ntime to put my tests back in order. I waded through the mass of failed tests\n... and where to start, which first? Basically I tried working &quot;bottom up&quot;,\nensuring a stabilizing foundation. I realized I was having to figure this\nout from knowing the code, knowing the packages. TestCases &quot;store&quot; my\ncontract knowledge, but not more -- they don&#39;t help this part of the major\nrefactor.\n\nAs such, I had my little epiphany on dependency. Why can&#39;t testcases express\ntheir own dependencies also & give &quot;starting places&quot; after a major refactor.\nHence I posted here...\n\nregards\n\nAdam\n\n\n",
