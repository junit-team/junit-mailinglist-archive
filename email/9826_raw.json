Now I can see that you are saying=\r\n that\n&gt; classes are dealt with using an object, and therefore they _are_\n&gt; =\r\nthat object.\n\nYes, that&#39;s how I understand the Liang/Bracha paper you refer=\r\nenced, and other stuff like the VM spec.  I&#39;ve read that Liang/Bracha paper=\r\n several times in the past few years when I was trying to grok classloaders=\r\n.\n\n&gt; May I submit that classes are dealt with using references, which are\n&gt;=\r\n themselves neither objects nor classes?  Oooo, this is tricky.\n\nBut that&#39;s=\r\n true of all reference types in Java at the language level.  A possible con=\r\nfusion being that ClassLoaders maintain references to the Class objects of =\r\nreference types they&#39;ve loaded, so there&#39;s no correlation between the garba=\r\nge collection of object instances of a reference type and the garbage colle=\r\nction of the binary class definition of the reference type itself, which ca=\r\nn only get collected when the ClassLoader that loaded the Class does.\n\nIs i=\r\nt clearer/more accurate to say that an instance of java.lang.Class is essen=\r\ntially a *wrapper* to the JVM&#39;s internal representation to a reference type=\r\n&#39;s definition (i.e., a lower-case &#39;class&#39;)?  I think that&#39;s closer to the t=\r\nruth.\n\nBasically, you can&#39;t access any reference type definition directly i=\r\nn Java except via reflective methods on an already loaded class or operatio=\r\nns on a not-yet-loaded class&#39;s binary definition.  If you change the bytes =\r\nthat make up a reference type&#39;s definition, then the type has to be loaded =\r\n(if not yet loaded) or reloaded in a new ClassLoader, including all the usu=\r\nal stuff the JVM does when loading a class (verify, link, resolve), which i=\r\ns done in JVM C code (I&#39;ve looked around in there a bit in the past).  Then=\r\n, you can access that type&#39;s definition in a read-only manner via the java.=\r\nlang.Class API.\n\n&gt; Part of the murkiness here is due to my peculiar experie=\r\nnce: \n&gt; I know that in reality Java at the JVM level is not a fully \n&gt; obje=\r\nct-oriented language.\n\nI doubt it&#39;s your fault.  There are a lot of overloa=\r\nded terms, like class/Class, and sloppy uses where we intend to mean someth=\r\ning else.  Tools like BCEL and common problems with ClassLoaders in tools l=\r\nike JUnit and J2EE application servers have really increased the numbers of=\r\n people who deal with this stuff in one way or another.\n\nScott Stirling\nWor=\r\nkscape, Inc.\nFramingham, MA\n\n**********************************************=\r\n*************************\nThis message is intended only for the use of the =\r\nintended recipient and\nmay contain information that is PRIVILEGED and/or CO=\r\nNFIDENTIAL.
