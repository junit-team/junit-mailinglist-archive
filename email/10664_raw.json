Class X implements I.  Class Y extends X.\n\nWith m=\r\ny current use of Junit, I&#39;ve taken the &quot;Inner Test Class for\nimplemented in=\r\nterfaces&quot; route.  That is, and I&#39;ll prefix test classes w/\na T...\n\nTX exten=\r\nds TestCase\nTX has an inner test class, TI\n\nTX&#39;s suite includes TX and TX.T=\r\nI\n\nI&#39;m running into a situation where I&#39;d like to have the factory method\ni=\r\nn TI to create an instance of X.  No problem, create a new instance and\nret=\r\nurn.\n\nHowever, when I get to Y, obviously it&#39;s still going to be creating a=\r\nn\ninstance of X.  What I&#39;d really like to do is have the factory method in\n=\r\nTI call the factory method in TX to create an instance of X.  Thus, in\nTY, =\r\nI would simply override this method and return an instance of Y\ninstead.  T=\r\nhis would allow me to execute TY which would run TY&#39;s tests,\nTX&#39;s tests, an=\r\nd TI&#39;s tests all against an instance of Y.\n\nQuestions:\n\n1. How do I build t=\r\nhe suite in TY?\n2. How can I properly link the factory methods so that I ca=\r\nn properly\noverride them?\n\t- e.g. previously, I tried - TI.createI() would =\r\ncall\nTX.createX().  I can&#39;t do this\n\tas when I get to TY, TI is still refer=\r\nencing TX through a static\nreference.\n\nMy problem with the inner class appr=\r\noach is that I would have to\nreimplement a TI for each subclass of X to ens=\r\nure that that subclass\ndidn&#39;t break the contract of I by overriding methods=\r\n, etc.\n\nDue diligence on the human side would allow me to avoid any complex=\r\n\nautomation of test inheritance, but humans forget and this will\nhopefully =\r\nallievate the problems when humans forget.\n\nMaybe I&#39;m approaching this all =\r\nwrong.  A fresh set of eyes would be\nhelpful.\n\nI&#39;ve read mentions of using =\r\na parameterized test case, but I&#39;m not\nfinding examples that fit the contex=\r\nt of my problem.\n\nAny help would be great!\n\nThanks,\n\nTom\n\n",
