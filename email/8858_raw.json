When I shared this situation and\nmy different ideas of how to deal with it, the suggestions I got all\ncentered on one method of handling it: abstract the unmanageable behind\ninterfaces and run my tests using a MockObject implementation of those\ninterfaces. \n\nIn your case is the mainframe specific code abstracted out of the\ntestable functionality?  If so you can test using a Mock implementation\nof the mainframe.  The other side someone else already suggested which\nis to ensure that the generated batch code matches known good examples. \nSimply set up the fake data which would generate one of  your known good\nexamples, and run the code in a unit test and check the output in the\ntestFunction().\n\nGood Luck!\nI know it&#39;s not easy to do all of this in my job.  But it&#39;s worth it\nwhere you can.\n\n-- \nDavid Boyer &lt;mangr3n@...&gt;\n\n\n",
