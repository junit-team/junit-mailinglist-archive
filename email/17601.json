Personally, I think that 90 seconds is ridiculously long.  You<br/>\n&gt;&gt;might as well be waiting for a C++ build in code with bad dependency<br/>\n&gt;&gt;management at that point.  Sure, running all the tests may take that<br/>\n&gt;&gt;long, but when I&#39;m working in an area of code, I start running subsets<br/>\n&gt;&gt;long before that.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;    <br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;We (well, maybe just I) might be talking about different things.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I usually only run tests before checking in, not every single time I save a<br/>\n&gt;file.  While I&#39;m coding, I usually never use the &quot;normal&quot; build procedure:<br/>\n&gt;I stay within Eclipse and use the IDE to compile and run everything.  I<br/>\n&gt;don&#39;t really care if the tests are broken at this point because it&#39;s<br/>\n&gt;inevitable, and as long as I&#39;m not checking in, I&#39;m not breaking anything.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Once I think I have something consistent and I feel ready to check in, I run<br/>\n&gt;the tests.  And this is when 90 seconds or even a few minutes doesn&#39;t really<br/>\n&gt;feel that long, because this is when I go back to the shell to run the<br/>\n&gt;&quot;real&quot; build (the build that the other team members will run) and I start<br/>\n&gt;doing some clean up, such as diff&#39;ing the files I&#39;m about to check in,<br/>\n&gt;making sure they are well commented, etc...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yes, it&#39;s just a different practice. I run the tests frequently to make <br/>\nsure that everything else is working while I work on one particular <br/>\nthing. Handy, particularly when refactoring.<br/>\n<br/>\nMichael Feathers<br/>\nwww.objectmnentor.com</div>",
