Have a look at the Ant\nwebsite : http://ant.apache.org/\n\nDownload the latest distribution and follow the sample build file available\nin manual section http://ant.apache.org/manual/index.html =&gt; Using Ant =&gt;\nWriting a Simple Buildfile \n\nOnce your are comfortable with writing your build file to compile and build\nyour java classes, then follow the link\nhttp://ant.apache.org/manual/index.html =&gt; Ant Tasks =&gt; Optional Tasks and\nuse JUnit and JUnit Report tasks for running testcases and create the report\nbased on testcase results.\n\nHave fun.\n\nRegards, Raj.\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: Srivastava, Pradeep [mailto:Pradeep.Srivastava@...]\nSent: Tuesday, September 23, 2003 10:42 AM\nTo: &#39;junit@yahoogroups.com&#39;\nSubject: RE: [junit] How to capture junit test reports\n\n\nThanks Eric for your suggestion while I had already tried redirecting the\noutput to a text file, but it doesn&#39;t look quite convincing.\n\nIt would be helpful if you could send a sample ANT script for compiling and\nrunning tests.\n\nRgds\nPradeep\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: Erik Mattsson [mailto:erik.mattsson@...]\nSent: Monday, September 22, 2003 12:24 PM\nTo: junit@yahoogroups.com\nSubject: Re: [junit] How to capture junit test reports\n\n\nOne way is to dump the output into a textfile using &quot;java -cp\ntests.jar;junit.jar com.foo.TestCase &gt; textfile.txt&quot;.\nThis is probably the simplest way but is not good in any way. The best way I\nthink is to use\nANT for this, in ant you can generate text-, html- and XML- files from the\ntestcases. The html\npages are pretty good, they show if anything went bad and it is simple to\nfind the testmethod that\nfailed.\n\nCheck out the JUNIT target at the ant.apache.org website. If you want I can\nsend\nyou our complete ANT script to compile and run tests.\n\n//Erik\n\n  ----- Original Message ----- \n  From: Srivastava, Pradeep \n  To: &#39;junit@yahoogroups.com&#39; \n  Sent: Monday, September 22, 2003 7:36 AM\n  Subject: [junit] How to capture junit test reports\n\n\n  Hi all,\n\n\n  I am new to junit, pls tell me how can I capture the output of junit tests\n  and put them in a text file or an html file for all cases of success,\n  failures or errors. I need to show this to the client claiming that our\n  system is passing all the unit tests cases.
