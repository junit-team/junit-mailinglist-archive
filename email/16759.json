Such testing is especially important in the <br/>\n&gt; presence of java generics -- you want to be sure that some data types, <br/>\n&gt; such as in method parameters, compile correctly, but others result in a <br/>\n&gt; compile error.  Testing these cases by hand defeats the whole purpose of <br/>\n&gt; unit testing.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Sorry in advance if I am missing your point! It seems that you are <br/>\ntrying to prove the java compiler works for both &#39;good&#39; and &#39;bad&#39; code <br/>\nthat uses the classes and methods you are interested in.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf this is the case, isn&#39;t it the job of the developer writing any new <br/>\ncode - which may use the existing classes - to make sure that their code <br/>\ncompiles and works?<br/>\n<br/>\nIf this isn&#39;t the case, can you illustrate the problem further?  I <br/>\nfigure it must be more complex than capturing and checking the output <br/>\nfrom javac?<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nMark</div>",
