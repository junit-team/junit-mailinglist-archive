It&#39;s quite likely that\n&gt; whatever did break will cause other cascading failures down the line\n&gt; even if the specific code those assertions are trying to test is in fact\n&gt; correct. JUnit goes to great efforts to make sure that each test method\n&gt; is completely independent of other test methods. There are good reasons\n&gt; for that.\n\nEG in [test] code I wrote yesterday, an \n\n    assertIsoModels( mWanted, mExpressionForGot );\n\nblew up because mExpressionForGot involved a null pointer.\n[assertIsoModels is code in my base class that does &quot;if\n m1 not isomorphic to m2, fail with a legible error message&quot;.]\n\nI first added\n\n    assertNotNull( thePointerThatWasNull );\n\nbefore the isomorphism test, then fixed the null problem.\nI really don&#39;t want assertNotNull to *continue* after \nspotting the problem!\n\nPS also this is a failure vs error thing: a NPE results\nfrom a different kind of brokenness than eg non-isomorphic\nmodels. I like it that the scary errors show up like this.\n\n-- \nChris &quot;electric hedgehog&quot; Dollin\nStross won one! Farah won one! Langford won TWO! \n\n\n",
