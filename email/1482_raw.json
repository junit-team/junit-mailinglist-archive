The\n    &gt; &gt; package-scope clients usually have a public interface of their \n    &gt; &gt; own which can\n    &gt; &gt; then be tested separately from the classes they interact with.  \n    &gt; \n    &gt; This is fair enough in a &quot;write tests first&quot; situation; I agree\n    &gt; that the tests of the public methods should be exhaustive enough\n    &gt; that they exercise any protected or private methods that are \n    &gt; utilised by the public methods.\n    &gt; \n    &gt; However, the situation I described, and a situation for which I\n    &gt; think JUnit is an excellent tool, is one in which someone is \n    &gt; refactoring an existing code-base.  I&#39;ve inherited 15,000+ lines\n    &gt; of code, and want the freedom of being able to &quot;smell a \n    &gt; code smell&quot;\n    &gt; and get right in there and fix it up, irrespective of whether the\n    &gt; &quot;smell&quot; occurs in a public, private, or protected method. \n    &gt;  However,\n    &gt; before I change ANYTHING in a system that is in production, and\n    &gt; it to all intents and purpose, working, I have to ensure that I\n    &gt; don&#39;t break existing functionality.\n    &gt; \n    &gt; If my methodology is to &quot;smell the bad smell, write a Unit Test to\n    &gt; confirm how I believe the protected/private method is working, \n    &gt; refactor the offending code, and then IIABDTTPMIFI&quot; (if it ain&#39;t\n    &gt; broke, don&#39;t tell the project manager I fixed it) is guaranteed\n    &gt; by rerunning of the JUnit test.\n    &gt; \n    &gt; In this instance, I very much see the need to be able to use JUnit\n    &gt; to test protected and private methods.\n    &gt; \n    &gt; FWIW, I found the JUnitX package at www.extreme-de.com, which\n    &gt; serves my needs perfectly, and also plugs in to my favourite\n    &gt; architecture level IDE, Together UML.\n    &gt; \n    &gt; Glad my occasional thread has prompted so much useful (for me)\n    &gt; discussion !\n    &gt; \n    &gt; Best wishes,\n    &gt; \n    &gt; Steven\n    &gt; \n    &gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n    &gt; junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n    &gt;  \n    &gt; \n    &gt; Your use of Yahoo!
