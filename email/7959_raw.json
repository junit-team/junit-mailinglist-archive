This is\nlaborious and impractical for larger network configuration of peers. It\nis\nalso hoped that with a more generic API that we can provide an easier\nmechanism for which a larger class of distributed tests can be written,\ncontributing to better quality and scalability of the JXTA platform and\nexternally developed JXTA applications.\n \nGoals are stated below.\n \n.       To provide a more automated and easier-to-use replacement for\nthe existing\nload test under the bench project.\n.       To provide a generic test harness/platform for which functional\ntests can\nbe developed and run systematically.\n \nOverview\n========\n \nThe project provides a component to automatically create and configure a\ntesting network of peers, given a set up user-defined network\nconfiguration\nand test advertisements. The test peers may consist of any\nuser-definable\nnumber and kind of JXTA peers. Each test peer is automatically\nbootstrapped\nto run a user configurable and written junit.framework.TestCase\ninstance. A\ncontrol peer initiates the distributed test sequence and monitors and\ncontrols the state of the other test peers. A test API is provided to\naid\nthe test writer in developing tests.\nThe existing load test code from the bench project\n(http://bench.jxta.org)\nwould be ported to run on JDF.\n \nStatus\n======\n \nHigh-level design document on the way. Some implementation prototyping\nwork\non peer creation and configuration has been done.\n \n \n \n \n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nTo subscribe, e-mail: discuss-subscribe@...\nFor additional commands, e-mail: discuss-help@...\n \n \n \n \n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n",
