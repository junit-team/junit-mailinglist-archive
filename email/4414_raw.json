Rainsberger&quot; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;If I didn&#39;t spend 80 hours writing these tests, I could spend my time\n&gt; &gt; writing each test as I need it and the rest of the time writing new\n&gt; &gt; code. Given what I know about the code, I won&#39;t be any faster writing\n&gt; &gt; tests whether I write them all at once or as I need them. With that in\n&gt; &gt; mind, what would you like me to do? In the worst case, I need all the\n&gt; &gt; tests up front and end up writing them now anyway. It looks like you\n&gt; &gt; win.&quot; How does that sound, everyone?\n&gt;\n&gt;I think it&#39;s important to understand the value of test coverage as\n&gt;perceived by the person requesting those tests.  In other words, if you\n&gt;had automatically-generated tests for all the code, how might that help\n&gt;you?\n\nMe, personally? Not at all. I have worked with generated code long enough \nnot to trust it. That&#39;s a personal bias that is perhaps unnecessarily \ndifficult for people to get around.\n\nOne, in general? Automatically-generated tests could help by providing a \nrefactoring safety net before the programmer was able to understand and \ntherefore craft by hand the same tests. It also has the downside of \nabsolving the programmer of the responsibility of understanding what the \ntests are doing -- this is because generated code is usually very difficult \nto read -- rendering their communication value quite low.\n\nEven if the autogen tests worked, the programmer would still likely want to \nreplace those tests with ones he can understand, over time. Then they would \nbe great. The problem is simple: I can&#39;t trust them enough. :)\n\nJ. B.
