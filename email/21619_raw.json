So far i&#39;m only loading every class that is changed u=\r\nsing IResourceChangedListener and URLClassLoader:\n\nURLClassLoader classLoad=\r\ner =3D new URLClassLoader(new URL[] {outputDirectory.toURL(), new URL(&quot;file=\r\n:/D:/eclipse/plugins/org.junit4_4.3.1/junit.jar&quot;) });\n\nClass&lt;?&gt; clazz =3D c=\r\nlassLoader.loadClass(fileName);\n\nAt this point everything looks great - whe=\r\nn i modify JUnit4 test class it gets loaded with annotations on proper meth=\r\nods (thanks to second URL - without it no annotation was loaded, and to be =\r\nhonest i don&#39;t know why). However, things start to go wrong when i pass the=\r\n loaded class to JUnitCore.run method - the result i always get says that t=\r\nhere was &quot;No runnable method&quot; exception even though there are clearly some =\r\nmethod annotaded with @Test...\n\nI have little experience in writing plugins=\r\n for Eclipse, so i&#39;m kind of lost now... I may suspect, that the problem is=\r\n with not sufficient classpath (cause it seems that it was a reason why i h=\r\nad to add another URL to class loader) of my plugin. So i&#39;m asking if anyon=\r\ne ever tried to dynamically load test classes from Eclipse plugin and run t=\r\nhem using JUnitCore - if so, I&#39;d be very grateful for helping me out with t=\r\nhis problem. \n\nThanks in advance.\nBest regards,\nMichal Olejnik\n\n\n",
