The runner works just fine, but the results\ndisplay is less=\r\n than expected.\nI have one class in my testing support package with a @RunW=\r\nith\nannotation for my runner. Set a property to the package under test and\n=\r\ntell JUnit to run the annotated class, and all tests in that package are\nex=\r\necuted. The name of the suite is reported as the name of the class\nwhich ha=\r\ns the @RunWith annotation, in both Ant and IntelliJ. My runner\nhas an overr=\r\nide for ParentRunner.getName() which returns the name of the\npackage under =\r\ntest. I verified that the string gets into the runner&#39;s\nDescription object.=\r\n What am I missing?\nEnvironment:\n    * JUnit: 4.5\n    * Ant: 1.7.0\n    * In=\r\ntelliJ IDEA: 8.1\n\nThanks for whatever direction you can provide.\n\n\n[Non-tex=\r\nt portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n",
