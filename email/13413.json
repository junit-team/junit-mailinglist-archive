Oh -<br/>\n&gt;  &gt;&gt; I&#39;m not writing much new code.  Most of the unit tests are for code<br/>\n&gt;  &gt;&gt; that already exists for which I&#39;m fixing bugs.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;  &gt; Good luck with that. I strongly recommend you also try to test-drive a<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; bunch of code, because that will teach you the goal for refactoring the<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; legacy stuff. If you don&#39;t know where you&#39;re going, how do you know you<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; got there?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; J.B., I&#39;m probably being block-headed but I don&#39;t quite get what you<br/>\n&gt; mean.  Can you say a little more about that?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>If you spend too much time writing tests for existing code, you&#39;ll learn <br/>\nlegacy code design techniques. Those are good for working around designs <br/>\nthat are difficult to test, but not necessarily good for designs you can <br/>\ncreate from scratch. I recommend that you also spend time writing new <br/>\ncode using TDD (&quot;test-driving&quot;) so that you get more feedback as to what <br/>\na good, testable design looks like. This way when you add tests to <br/>\nexisting code, you&#39;ll know what kind of design to work towards, rather <br/>\nthan just how to get around the existing design.<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope that is more clear.<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJ.
