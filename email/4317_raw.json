Using a contract\nprogramming strategy can be dangerous because some new requirements should\narise during the project development and anyone can imagine what could\nhappen to all interfaces if some interdependecies between the various entity\nhasn&#39;t been taken into account or sone new ones arise.\n\nBye,\nLuca Sfarzo\nTRS\nItaly\n\n\n\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: &quot;Vladimir Bossicard&quot; &lt;vladimir@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;junit@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Saturday, March 09, 2002 7:05 AM\nSubject: Re: [junit] Where to place test classes?\n\n\n&gt; I don&#39;t want to start another &quot;holy war&quot;...  just presenting another POV:\n&gt;\n&gt; if your production classes are located unter a src/ directory, just\n&gt; mirror your hierarchy in a test/ directory.\n&gt;\n&gt; you will have then: src/edu/washington/library/Book.java\n&gt; and your test in  : test/edu/washington/library/BookTest.java\n&gt;\n&gt; You will be able to test your public interface, striped them when\n&gt; dealing with the release but you will be able to:\n&gt; - test your protected methods\n&gt; - easily generate Javadoc with Ant (as far as I know, the Javadoc Ant\n&gt; task can&#39;t deal with FileSets, so it&#39;s impossible (?) to only include\n&gt; your production classes in your javadoc documentation)\n&gt;\n&gt; You can have a look at some really well organized projects (those of\n&gt; Jakarta for example - http://jakarta.apache.org) and see by yourself.\n&gt;\n&gt; But it&#39;s a matter of taste.\n&gt;\n&gt; -Vladimir\n&gt;\n&gt; --\n&gt; Vladimir Bossicard\n&gt; www.bossicard.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
