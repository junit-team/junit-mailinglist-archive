I find it to be very valuable to do so.\n\nAnyway, if you don&#39;t =\r\nwant to question the design, I think we already\nprovided solutions to make =\r\nit possible with Junit. As it&#39;s not the preferred\nway of working for many J=\r\nunit users, I think it&#39;s reasonable that the\nsolution isn&#39;t part of Junit&#39;s=\r\n core.\n\n&gt; At\n&gt; different levels it looks up and initializes the composite o=\r\nbjects\n&gt; for that level. Derivatives uses them sometimes or overrides\n&gt; dep=\r\nending on their needs. \n\nI see two issues here:\n\nFirst, objects are complex=\r\n. The general advice here is to simplify them. Use\ncomposition to build a c=\r\nomplex web of objects to provide complex behaviour.\nIn your unit tests, don=\r\n&#39;t write many tests for the complex web, but for\nsimple objects it is compo=\r\nsed of. Where an object in the web needs to\ncollaborate with other objects =\r\nin the web, in your unit tests replace them\nwith stub/mock implementations.=\r\n\n\nOr, if you think you can&#39;t do that, google for the Object Mother pattern.=\r\n\n\nSecond, I understood you to say that you are reusing objects between test=\r\ns,\nso only the first test using an object would instantiate it, the followi=\r\nng\nwould reuse it. Generally, this is a big no-no in unit testing, and I&#39;d =\r\nlike\nto understand why you think you need to do it.\n\n \n&gt;&gt;  So are you sayin=\r\ng the Bizdoc objects are global to the tests? What\n&gt;&gt; does it  mean to &quot;ini=\r\ntialize&quot; them? Where are the hold?\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt; BizDoc is the System object and Bi=\r\nzDocUt is Unit test class\n&gt; which tests the BizDoc operations/API. Here Par=\r\nent(s) can\n&gt; have any name which extends TestCase and BizDocUt and other\n&gt; =\r\ntests would inherit and use them as just parents .  These\n&gt; parent(s) will =\r\nnot have testXXX methods.\n\nI don&#39;t feel that this answers my question. Perh=\r\naps my writings above help\nyou understand where my question is coming from.=\r\n..\n\n&gt;&gt;  Frankly, no, I don&#39;t feel it is. It rather looks to me as if your\n&gt;=\r\n&gt; design is  suboptimal, and that your testing problems are just a\n&gt;&gt; sympt=\r\nom of that. I  don&#39;t know enough to be sure, though.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt; System design is=\r\n for meeting the requirement not meeting the\n&gt; testing requirement. When we=\r\n are writing test cases at the\n&gt; lower level (API testing) we can&#39;t expect =\r\na seperate set of API for\n&gt; testing purpose only. \n\nNot a separate API. Wha=\r\nt I&#39;m saying is that many people experience that\nmaking the API testable im=\r\nproves the design in general. With other words,\nmeeting unit testing requir=\r\nements is a great help in meeting the general\nrequirement of producing a fl=\r\nexible and extensible design.\n\n&gt;&gt;  If you want, you can write a TestSuite i=\r\nmplementation that uses\n&gt;&gt; reflection  to only call the test methods declar=\r\ned directly in a\n&gt;&gt; class (that is, not the  inherited ones). I think it wo=\r\nuld take me\n&gt;&gt; less than an hour to do so. In  years of using Junit, I neve=\r\nr felt\n&gt;&gt; the need to do that, though. \n&gt;&gt; \n&gt; I understand you have not enc=\r\nountered this before and that is\n&gt; the reason why I have explained a scenar=\r\nio which needs this.\n\nLet me clarify: I certainly encountered code that was=\r\n hard to test using\nJunit. My solution until now always was to improve the =\r\ncode, not to extend\nJunit, though. And I wholeheartedly think it was the be=\r\ntter solution.\n\nCheers, Ilja\n\n\n",
