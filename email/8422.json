Integration tests do as you<br/>\nstate. They can be used to validate proper system-wide behavior, and<br/>\nthey may well exercise a lot of code in the process. However, when an<br/>\nintegration test fails how do you know where to start looking for the<br/>\nunderlying cause? This is where unit tests come in. If you write unit<br/>\ntests as you write your software (or write the tests first as in TDD)<br/>\nyou will have a rich set of tests that exercise your code at a low<br/>\nlevel. This way you can be assured that each individual class and method<br/>\nis doing what it was designed to do. Integration tests then test the<br/>\ninteraction of these fully-tested modules. If an integration test fails,<br/>\nand all the modules that are involved in that test each passed their<br/>\nunit tests then<br/>\na) Perhaps the unit tests were inadequate and all desired behavior was<br/>\nnot tested<br/>\nb) Perhaps there is a misunderstanding between the modules, each of<br/>\nwhich is behaving &#39;properly&#39;. <br/>\n<br/>\nBecause I have a pretty thorough set of unit tests, if an integration<br/>\ntest fails I immediately suspect that there is a misunderstanding<br/>\nbetween what one module is providing and what is expected. When I find<br/>\nthe root cause, it is usually one of two things -- either I did not pay<br/>\nattention to my own documentation of the interface and assume a wrong<br/>\nreturn type (array of Strings vs a Vector of Strings for example), or I<br/>\ndid not properly test all the functionality in a module that I should<br/>\nhave. If I misunderstood the interface, I fix that (update documentation<br/>\nas appropriate) and go on. If I had not properly tested the<br/>\nfunctionality, I add unit tests, fix the problem and continue. <br/>\n<br/>\nI find that my experience is exactly counter to your &#39;naive hunch&#39; in<br/>\nthat my cost per bug eliminated is much less if I have unit tests.<br/>\nFurther, I find myself asking a key question whenever I am adding<br/>\nfunctionality: &quot;How will I test this automatically?&quot; I find that when I<br/>\nask this question first and make testability a key requirement in adding<br/>\nfunctionality two things happen. First, I write better code, more<br/>\nmodular, more loosely coupled, and smaller -- less code does more work.<br/>\nSecond, I have a lot fewer bugs uncovered during any level of testing.<br/>\nThis yields an even better unintended side effect -- more working code<br/>\nin less time. <br/>\n<br/>\nOne last thing. Unfortunately I can&#39;t provide scientific numbers, only<br/>\nmy own experience. Yours may vary. I have found myself being drawn into<br/>\nthe mode of writing tests first (and writing javadoc at the same time)<br/>\nbecause it works for me. I was always a firm believer in testing, and<br/>\nthat someone else should do it. Now I am in a small company with no QA<br/>\ndepartment and I have to write the software as well as ensure it works<br/>\nand support the end users. To do this I write javadoc and religiously<br/>\nmaintain it. I write unit tests religiously. And I write integration<br/>\ntests. I do all of this in less time than I used to just write code.<br/>\nAgain, your mileage may vary, but this approach definitely works for me.<br/>\n<br/>\nHopefully others will chime much more eloquently than I on this.<br/>\n<br/>\nFrank<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Fri, 2003-06-20 at 10:54, Mike Bresnahan wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; I have experience with integration testing but not much with unit testing.<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve been reading up on unit testing  (e.g. mock objects, test first<br/>\n&gt; development).  However, I have not found an article that explains the<br/>\n&gt; advantages of unit testing vs integration testing.  My perhaps naive hunch<br/>\n&gt; is that the cost-per-bug-eliminated of unit testing is higher than that of<br/>\n&gt; integration testing.  It appears this way because a single integration test<br/>\n&gt; tests a lot more code than a single unit test and takes about the same<br/>\n&gt; amount of time to construct.  Plus it seems to me that a whole suite of unit<br/>\n&gt; tests with 100% code coverage cannot guarantee that even the simplest system<br/>\n&gt; wide behavior is correct (e.g. the web page appears).  Am I wrong about<br/>\n&gt; this?  Can someone refer me information about this topic.  A scientific<br/>\n&gt; study paper with real numbers would be welcome.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Mike Bresnahan<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\">junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
