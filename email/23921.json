The problem with the retry is that since the same statement is reused, the fields will not be re-initialized between retries.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve tried to find a solution to this. It looks to me like I would have to create my own test runner to achieve this, which ideally I would like to avoid.<br/>\n<br/>\nAm I correct in that I have to create a custom test runner, or can it be done in some other way?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks<br/>\n<br/>\nDaniel</div>",
