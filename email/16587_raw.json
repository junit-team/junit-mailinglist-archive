But\n=\r\none problem is how to organise groups of test classes into suites. In\nv3.8 =\r\nit seemed very easy - just make your own class with a static suite()\nmethod=\r\n and then add your required classes.\nBut how do you do this in version 4? T=\r\nhe only documentation I&#39;ve found\n( in the javadocs)\nsuggests addin @RunWith=\r\n annotations to your suite class but I don&#39;t\nunderstand what to do, or how =\r\nyou specify a list of test classes .\nMany thanks for any advice!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
