The important thing, however, <br/>\n&gt; is to instill the notion of OO purity, which is harder, <br/>\n&gt; perhaps, than just teaching the language.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; For example: the GoF patterns book is a must, but I think it <br/>\n&gt; is not a text that you can give to someone until they have a <br/>\n&gt; grounding in OO techniques.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Your thoughts?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Manuel Amago.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -----------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; DISCLAIMER<br/>\n&gt; I know this group is not for this type of question, which is <br/>\n&gt; why I explicitly labelled this thread as OT (Off Topic).  I <br/>\n&gt; hope you will forgive my impertinence.  ;) But, I greatly <br/>\n&gt; value the opinions of the people on this list, and I trust <br/>\n&gt; your opinion on this particular issue. </span></blockquote></div>",
