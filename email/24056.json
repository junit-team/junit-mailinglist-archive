Providing both jars in the zip file as a convenience for those that download manually is both nice and highlights the dependency.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Paul Holser&quot; &lt;pholser@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Marc, I think the way it&#39;s set up for non-Maven users is fine; as a Maven user, I&#39;ll be thrilled to depend explicitly only on junit:junit.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Ultimately I think it&#39;d be great to break JUnit&#39;s dependency on Hamcrest entirely, but I suspect that&#39;s a much more involved effort (JUnit 5?).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Thanks again!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --p<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a>, Marc Philipp &lt;mphilipp82@&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Paul,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; we have deprecated the Maven artifact that used to have Hamcrest embedded since that didn&#39;t make any sense from a Maven point-of-view (see the release notes for details).<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; The all-in-one JAR (junit.jar) is still offered as a download for users that simply want to get started using JUnit without having to download an extra JAR from Hamcrest.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; An alternative would be to remove the two JARs from the downloads altogether and instead put the Hamcrest JAR along with what is now called junit-dep.jar inside the JUnit ZIP file with a simple README that explains how to use it. In this scenario, there wouldn&#39;t be an old school junit.jar any longer.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; What do you think?<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Regards, Marc<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>",
