Or you could<br/>\n&gt; &gt; start writing a bunch of hand-crafted logging statements since<br/>\n&gt; &gt; logging is sometimes more effective than debugging.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; But in some cases the assertion log would already be logging what<br/>\n&gt; &gt; you need to know without your having to write those statements.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; It&#39;s just another tool that is sometimes useful. Debuggers<br/>\n&gt; &gt; are important, but you don&#39;t have to use them.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; ...or you could write smaller, more focused tests and learn something<br/>\n&gt; about design.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Is this a fair statement to make? You&#39;ve never met Phil nor have you<br/>\nseen any of his test cases. You&#39;ve no idea if he writes small focused<br/>\ntests or not.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think we can all learn to do a better job but I don&#39;t think this<br/>\nsort of reply serves either Phil or you well. Perhaps if this<br/>\ndiscussion were face to face that would have helped us all.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers<br/>\nMark<br/>\n----------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nBlog: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.notesfromatooluser.com/\">http://www.notesfromatooluser.com/</a><br/>\nOne Year of Scrum: Lessons Learned<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.notesfromatooluser.com/2007/10/one-year-of-scr.html\">http://www.notesfromatooluser.com/2007/10/one-year-of-scr.html</a><br/>\nAperture vs. Lightroom - best comparisons<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.notesfromatooluser.com/2007/02/aperture_vs_lig.html\">http://www.notesfromatooluser.com/2007/02/aperture_vs_lig.html</a><br/>\nCustomer Retention Department - Vonage Customer Service Sucks<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.notesfromatooluser.com/2007/06/customer_retent.html\">http://www.notesfromatooluser.com/2007/06/customer_retent.html</a></div>",
