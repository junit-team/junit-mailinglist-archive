I think that a\n&gt; JUnit-specific annotation, which is not name-confusable with a standard\n&gt; like @ThreadSafe, seems to be a pretty clear winner.  If we feel strongly\n&gt; that it should remain consonant with @ThreadSafe, we could make it a static\n&gt; inner annotation, and reference it as @....\n\n\nI&#39;m personally find with that as long as the JavaDoc for the annotation\nmakes it clear that a RunListener implementation annotated with that\ninterface will be treated differently than one not annotated with that\ninterface when addListener() and removeListener() is called.\n\n\n\n&gt;  That might\n&gt; also have the advantage of making clear that it&#39;s a single-purpose\n&gt; annotation (I&#39;d rather not, at this point, start speculatively figuring out\n&gt; what other interfaces might try to pun meanings onto a general-purpose\n&gt; ThreadSafe annotation)\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;m a little curious about the third-party library implementation.  Let&#39;s\n&gt; say I write a package FooTest which is compiled against JUnit 4.12, and it\n&gt; contains a FooListener I&#39;d like to mark threadsafe.  A client wants to use\n&gt; it with JUnit 4.11 (she knows she won&#39;t get the concurrent performance\n&gt; boost, but wants it to just work).  The document seems to assume that if\n&gt; FooListener has a RunListener.TheadSafe annotation, then our client won&#39;t\n&gt; have a problem (unless, likely, she actually tries to instantiate all of\n&gt; the annotations from FooListener in her own code).\n\n\nCorrect as of JDK 1.5.0_06. See\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/3567413/why-doesnt-a-missing-annotation-cause-a-classnotfoundexception-at-runtime\n\nIt sounds that if the client wants to write code that extends FooListener\nthen JUnit 4.12 will need to be on the compile-time classpath\n\n\n\n&gt; However, the document\n&gt; assumes that declaring a marker interface ThreadSafeRunListener _would_\n&gt; break the client.  Is that true?\n\n\nI believe it would result in a NoClassDefFoundError exception. It should be\neasy to verify.\n\nNote that it may be hard to write a library that has a compile-time\ndependency on JUnit 4.12 while being runtime compatible with 4.11 for other\nreasons.\n\n Does FooListener fail at bytecode\n&gt; verification because the verifier wants to make sure that it implements all\n&gt; of ThreadSafeRunListener&#39;s methods?\n&gt;\n\nThat would be my guess.\n\n-- Kevin\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n",
