Go for it. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I&#39;m still not convinced of the economics of unit testing at the<br/>\n&gt; lowest level.<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve been lurking this list for quite some time, attended online and<br/>\n&gt; offline seminars, listened to to Agile, XP and TDD talks, ...<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Gotta love theory ... right up until reality smacks it upside the head.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; And apply it at work.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Now you&#39;re talking.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I am convinced that TDD is a right approach.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Me too.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I see big value in the agile methods.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yup.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; But to my feeling unit testing can be done at the requirements level.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Of course it can. No one around here is likely to say that it can&#39;t<br/>\nbe. Now, that said, we also believe that it brings many benefits at<br/>\nthe lower levels as well.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; That&#39;s why I am thinking about testdriving this approach:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 1: Write unit tests only to test the requirements.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Can&#39;t individual objects have requirements?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; 2: Write the code that implements these requirements, until tests<br/>\n&gt; pass.<br/>\n&gt; 3: Run the unit tests together with a code coverage tool<br/>\n&gt; 4: delete all executable lines of code not covered by the unit test<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>If the code was developed with TDD, will there really be much unused<br/>\ncode kicking around?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &lt;/controversial&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Good for a first try, but you&#39;ll have to try harder than that to get a<br/>\ngood flamefest going. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nYou see, to my mind you&#39;ve described integration testing. This is very<br/>\nimportant and needful to deliver software quality, but you&#39;re still<br/>\nonly testing the joined together building blocks. Does it not make<br/>\nsense to ensure that the blocks you&#39;re joining together are of high<br/>\nquality?<br/>\n<br/>\nSimon<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nsimonpeter.org | simonpeter.com | techbook.info</div>",
