I&#39;m editing some fields to be sent later to a server and the \n&gt; connection\n&gt; goes down. Ok the mediator can do the great part of the job but what if \n&gt; my\n&gt; current form should let me save the data into a file in order to \n&gt; retrieve\n&gt; them later? That kind of knowledge lies inside the form (it&#39;s its own\n&gt; responsibility, above all!) while the constraints come from the outer \n&gt; world.\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi,\n&gt; Luca Sfarzo\n&gt; TRSNeapolis\n&gt; Tel:+390815272842\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; -----Messaggio originale-----\n&gt; Da: Bob Koss [mailto:koss@...]\n&gt; Inviato: martedi 11 giugno 2002 15.37\n&gt; A: junit@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Oggetto: Re: [junit] gui testing\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; On 6/11/02 7:28 AM, &quot;Michael Silverstein&quot; &lt;msilverstein@...&gt;\n&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Bob Koss [mailto:koss@...] wrote:\n&gt;&gt;&gt; But if we use Mediator to decouple the gui controls, we may as\n&gt;&gt;&gt; well delegate\n&gt;&gt;&gt; everything to the Mediator and leave the gui stupid. The Mediator can \n&gt;&gt;&gt; be\n&gt;&gt;&gt; unit tested just like any other class, and doesn&#39;t need the gui since \n&gt;&gt;&gt; all\n&gt;&gt;&gt; communication is done through interfaces.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; That notwithstanding, you still need to test the connection between the\n&gt;&gt; mediator and your GUI. There&#39;s still plenty of room for error there.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;m trying to understand your concern. I can test that the Mediator \n&gt; send the\n&gt; right message with the right parameters at the right time. The code in \n&gt; the\n&gt; gui (let&#39;s say a Dialog box just to be concrete) that responds to this\n&gt; message is one or two lines of code which IMO, can&#39;t break.\n&gt;\n&gt; Can you show me in a few lines of code where there is room for error \n&gt; between\n&gt; the Mediator and the gui/dialog/whatever?\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; --\n&gt; Robert Koss, Ph.D.     | Training, Mentoring, Contract Development\n&gt; Senior Consultant      | Object Oriented Design, C++, Java\n&gt; www.objectmentor.com   | Extreme Programming\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
