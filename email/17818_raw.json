(Relates to design-for-testability)\r\nX-Yahoo-Group-Post: member; u=127224993; y=Ah9MkjC_RQFawpngOK0PLc2HlLAuWPvlAQgMtDPKrVpxMFs\r\nX-Yahoo-Profile: nails762\r\n\r\nElliotte Harold wrote:\n\n&gt; Robert Martin wrote:\n&gt;  &gt;&gt;&gt; Elliotte, what are the downsides of interfaces, in your opinion?\n&gt;  &gt;&gt; 1. Excess complexity\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; They make receiving a message more complex, it&#39;s true. They make\n&gt;  &gt; sending a message much simpler. Or rather, they add more lines of\n&gt;  &gt; code on the receiving side; but they eliminate dependencies on the\n&gt;  &gt; sending side. The benefit of those eliminated dependencies is very\n&gt;  &gt; powerful.\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m not sure I believe the second part. In practice, replacing a\n&gt; concrete-class based solution with an interface-based solution expands\n&gt; the complexity for the caller. What used to require a single class now\n&gt; typically requires three: a factory to create the factory, the factory\n&gt; itself, and the interface you&#39;re actually trying to create. I&#39;m not sure\n&gt; you really need all that, but you need at least two pieces where you\n&gt; previously needed one, and in practice three is what we usually seem to\n&gt; end up with. (Think of DocumentBuilderFactory, DocumentBuilder, and\n&gt; Document in JAXP/DOM for example). And of course there are still\n&gt; concrete classes for each of these. We&#39;ve turned what could have been\n&gt; one concrete class (Document) into six separate pieces! What could have\n&gt; been this:\n&gt; \n&gt; Document doc = new Document();\n&gt; \n&gt; is now this:\n&gt; \n&gt; DocumentBuilderFactory factory = DocumentBuilderFactory.getInstance();\n&gt; DocumentBuilder builder = factory.newDocumentBuilder();\n&gt; Document doc = builder.newDocument();\n\nBe careful! The Builder pattern is by no means needed to create an \ninstance of an interface. JAXP/DOM combines, for whatever reason, the \nSingleton, Abstract Factory and Builder pattern, when all you really \nneed is this:\n\n     Document document = new WritableDocument();\n\nI could see using the Builder pattern to simplify the interface for \nconstructing a document, separating creating a document from reading it, \nbut by no means does JAXP/DOM do what it does because of /interfaces/.\n\nIt&#39;s true that if you have a bunch of related interfaces (like in a GUI \ntoolkit), you might want an Abstract Factory, but neither Singleton nor \nBuilder enter the picture just because you have interfaces.\n\n&gt; I fail to see how that&#39;s simpler.\n\nIt&#39;s not, and interfaces didn&#39;t make it more complex: the Singleton, \nAbstract Factory and Builder patterns did. If this is a representative \nexample of why you find interfaces unnecessarily complex, then I really \nbelieve you&#39;re blaming the wrong part of the design.\n\nTake care.\n-- \nJ. B.
