This is one of<br/>\n&gt; the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; many examples where test-driven design is sometimes the wrong thing to<br/>\n&gt; do.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Who said that a test has to be welded to only one class? TDD does not<br/>\n&gt; preclude using interfaces.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>No, but sayings such as &quot;Do the simplest thing that could possibly work&quot; or<br/>\n&quot;You aren&#39;t gonna need it&quot; imply it...  A bit tangential to TDD, admittedly.<br/>\n<br/>\nStill, sometimes, I find that putting the emphasis on testing first can<br/>\nsometimes impact the final interface of your solution adversely.  In other<br/>\nwords:  your code ends up being more test-friendly than caller-friendly.<br/>\n<br/>\nA test is more a matter of a programmer<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; thinking &quot;how do I want to call to receive the desired<br/>\n&gt; functionality?&quot;. The programmer might decide that an interface is<br/>\n&gt; exactly what needs to be used to call the method, and the test would<br/>\n&gt; reflect that. To satisfy that test, the programmer would then create a<br/>\n&gt; couple of classes, one of which would be the interface that they<br/>\n&gt; decided would be part of the calling signature. (Remember, TDD is not<br/>\n&gt; XP, you don&#39;t have to follow YAGNI.)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Agreed,  I conflated both a bit in my previous statement, sorry about that.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nCédric<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://testng.org\">http://testng.org</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",
