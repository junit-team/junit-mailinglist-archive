A simple @Test annotation with a simple @RunWith did a l=\r\not of things for us for a long time. Although in the same breath I would al=\r\nso like to state the fact that the things around us change constantly. IMHO=\r\n, during the constant changes, we should be able to hold on to the simple t=\r\nhings and build on top of that to accommodate the changing requirements. \n =\r\nThere is a great need in the IT world currently to do data driven testing s=\r\nuch that the data is not coupled with the test. The main benefit it gives i=\r\ns the ability to control data and test separately, which results in less co=\r\nupling and ultimately better maintenance.\n\nEasyTest is trying to achieve ex=\r\nactly that by extending JUnit in a way  that its simplicity is conserved(Ea=\r\nsyTest works with @Test annotations) and at the same time users have the ab=\r\nility to specify the data outside of their test classes. \n\nDo have a look a=\r\nt EasyTest and share your thoughts with us. Its always good to get feedback=\r\n from the people who have experience in the related field. Here&#39;s EasyTest =\r\nfor your reference:\nhttps://github.com/EaseTech/easytest\n\nCheers!\nAnuj\n\n---=\r\n In junit@yahoogroups.com, Teemu Kanstr=E9n &lt;tkanstren@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi a=\r\nll,\n&gt; \n&gt;  Maybe I am a bit off topic, but I think JUnit used to be really n=\r\nice when\n&gt; you looked it up and it was so simple to use and understand. Now=\r\n you get\n&gt; these rules, theories, runners, and all kinds of strange things.=\r\n They are\n&gt; nice for anyone needing to extend JUnit to integrate with somet=\r\nhing\n&gt; external but I wish the user never needs to see the stuff..\n&gt; \n&gt;  I =\r\nlike the basic use of annotations in JUnit 4 but I prefer to have any\n&gt; mor=\r\ne complex stuff written in the code and not in the annotations.\n&gt; \n&gt;  Of co=\r\nurse, it is nice to have the option and support those who like a\n&gt; differen=\r\nt type of an approach.\n&gt; \n&gt;  Just saying... :)\n&gt; \n&gt; Teemu\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; [Non-text=\r\n portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt;\n\n\n",
