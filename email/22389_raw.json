I then ran into the test case \n&gt; that confirms that action.  Coming from the aspect that I \n&gt; want to have confidence that my code and tests are \n&gt; functioning properly, I honestly think that is the wrong action.\n&gt; \n&gt; If an assumption is violated then it should be either a \n&gt; failure or at best ignored.  To say the test passes because \n&gt; something failed is like saying you don&#39;t have a cavity \n&gt; because the dentist doesn&#39;t have the right tool.  You don&#39;t \n&gt; know one way or the other, and the test won&#39;t be able to run \n&gt; properly when the assumption is violated.\n&gt; \n&gt; It&#39;s partly that reason that I don&#39;t use assumptions to begin \n&gt; with.  If there needs to be a certain precondition to the \n&gt; test passing, I will add those assertions before I perform \n&gt; the action that needs to be tested.  To me, it is a failure \n&gt; if the test could not be set up properly.\n&gt; \n&gt; If you want something a little softer, then I recommend that \n&gt; a failed assumption is equivalent to the @Ignore annotation.  \n&gt; You&#39;ll see in the summary that X number of tests were run, Y \n&gt; number of tests ignored, and Z number of tests failed.  \n&gt; Although, for ignored tests I&#39;d like to see what the reason \n&gt; was (failed assumption or manually ignored through the attribute).\n&gt; \n&gt; Making a test pass because of a failed assumption gives you a \n&gt; false sense of security about your code.  What is happening \n&gt; is that the test just wasn&#39;t run, and there may be a \n&gt; legitimate problem hiding.  To me that is the most dangerous \n&gt; part of that solution.  I&#39;d rather get the bad news straight \n&gt; than trust faulty information.\n&gt; \n&gt; Am I making sense?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; Yahoo!
