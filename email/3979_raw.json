It becomes very important to test only things that can \n=\r\nbreak.  This is the number one argument I see people use against Test \nFirs=\r\nt.  Don&#39;t test setters/getters, DB reads and writes, container \nmanaged per=\r\nsistence, etc. unless they start breaking.  The best way \nto determine thin=\r\ngs are breaking is by having \nacceptance/system/functional/integration test=\r\ns.  If you have a broken \nacceptance test then you are probably missing at =\r\nleast one unit test.\n\nAs others have pointed out in the long term there is =\r\nno overhead, as \nit cuts down on debugging time so much.  Personally I know=\r\n that test \nfirst makes people go faster.  I see this every time I teach a =\r\n\nclass.  Inevitable one or two pairs don&#39;t do test first.  These are \nalso =\r\nthe folks who finish the assignment last (or not at all).\n\nErik Meade\nhttp:=\r\n//junit.org\nemeade@...\n \n\n\n",
