This would allow \nthe testing to fall thru the code and the various assertions/check \nconditions!!\n\nBut would love to hear / see whatz the cleanest meanest way of doing \nthis? \n\nI thought of writing a overridden check()  method for every kind of \nassert() in the api&#39;s\nthis way we would have to call the check() instead of the assert, \n\nthe check method then calls the assert with the same method argument\n in a  try catch and in the try we set it to true \nand  in the catch(AssertFailedException ae) we set the flag \nto &quot;failed/false&quot; whatever..\n\nFinally towards the end of the test we could then do a assert on the \nflag to fail or succeed the whole test??\n\nthoughts ideas welcome!!\n\nregards\nkrishna\n\n\n\n\n",
