Today, I <br/>\nfound that the developer had implemented System.exit(n) throughout <br/>\nthe application whenever there was a trapped exception.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, the requirements call for the application to return some exit <br/>\ncode telling any downstream processes whether this application was <br/>\n100% successful with no warnings (rc=0), 100% successful with <br/>\nwarnings (rc=4), not successful at all (rc=8).  However, the only <br/>\njava mechanism for reporting return codes is System.exit(n), based on <br/>\nmy use of Google.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy JUnit dilemma then, is that System.exit(n) gives the required <br/>\napplication behavior but doesn&#39;t seem to be good for running JUnit <br/>\ntests from a test suite since System.exit(n) ends the JVM.<br/>\n<br/>\nDoes anyone have any insights they can share?  Since this is my first <br/>\npost to this forum, I&#39;m happy to Google some more if you&#39;ll only give <br/>\nme some keyword hint(s) beyond what I&#39;ve already tried:  &quot;java exit <br/>\ncode&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks!</div>",
