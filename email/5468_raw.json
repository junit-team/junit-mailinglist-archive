The basic facilities provide a higher level of \nabstraction than the basic java.awt.Robot (thus the derivation of the \nname, A Better &#39;Bot).  The abstraction level is something like this:\n\ntester.actionClick(component);\ntester.actionSelectCell(row, col);\ntester.actionDrag(component, x, y);\ntester.actionDrop(component, x, y);\ntester.actionKeyString(&quot;A message typed&quot;);\n\n   All of these actions are translated into their basic OS-level events.  \nThe abbot framework test suite uses these actions in run-of-the-mill \nJUnit test cases to test its own recording and playback capabilities.\n\n   The script-level facilities lend themselves to system and functional \ntesting while the programmatic ones are more suited to fine-grained unit \ntesting.\n\nT.\n\nOn Tuesday, July 23, 2002, at 03:09 PM, jlinkyh wrote:\n\n&gt; Since testing of Swing and GUI applications is a regular topic here,\n&gt; I&#39;m going to upload a preliminray version of chapter 13 of my\n&gt; forthcoming book &quot;Unit Testing in Java&quot;.
