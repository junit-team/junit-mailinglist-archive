So our build was unstable as\nnone of us knew exactly how to fix th=\r\nose test cases or how to fix the\ninfrastructure they were testing against..=\r\n. but he&#39;d be back in 2 weeks...\nwe were writing away our tests.\n\nThe Frida=\r\ny before &quot;Bob&quot; came back we had our sprint review with management,\nthey loo=\r\nked at the Code coverage graph in Jenkins... it was sitting nice\nand near o=\r\nur end-game target at 73%... pats on back all round.\n\n&quot;Bob&quot; comes back, fix=\r\nes the infrastructure (some SQL Server permission\nissue), and we&#39;re back to=\r\n a &quot;stable&quot; build. (I should point out that\neveryone was using local code c=\r\noverage tooling to write *targeted* tests...\nwe had a list of the least cov=\r\nered classes and you would just focus on\nwriting *unit* tests for that clas=\r\ns, so nobody was looking at the test\ncoverage graph...\n\nThose 5 failing tes=\r\nt cases were tripping every single exception path that\nthe regular test cas=\r\nes were missing...

Quis custodiet ipsos custodes?)\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt; =\r\nThis is how techniques like model-based testing work. In my view your\n&gt; &quot;in=\r\ndependently derived specification&quot; is in such case tested by the\n&gt; implemen=\r\ntation. Because your implementation is from the viewpoint of your\n&gt; tests a=\r\nnother &quot;independently derived specification&quot;. When you generate\n&gt; tests and=\r\n run those, they will tell you if there is a mismatch. Which of\n&gt; your inte=\r\nrpretation of system intent is at fault is then to be\n&gt; investigated..\n&gt;\n\nQ=\r\nuis custodiet ipsos custodes?\n\nWho will guard the guards?\n\nIf you generate =\r\ncode tests from a specification, that is great. We now know\nthat the code i=\r\nmplements the specification correctly... we have guards that\ncheck the code=\r\n... but who will check that the guards are enforcing the\ncorrect things?\n\nI=\r\n would argue that it is somewhat easier to verify code than verify a\nspecif=\r\nication... at least for a lot of the specifications you will see out\nthere.=\r\n\n\nSome specifications are use-case based, with wooly descriptions of\nbehavi=\r\nour. These tend to generate example based test-cases... which give\ngood con=\r\nfidence that the use-case(s) are met... but no confidence when you\nwalk off=\r\n the tested path.\n\nSome specifications mix requirements with design, e.g. t=\r\nhe UML based type.\n\nI think you can generate test cases for a parser based =\r\non the specification\nof the grammar that it is required to parse.\n\nI think =\r\nyou can generate test cases for a performance specification...\n\nBut most of=\r\n the rest of the time the specification is just too high a level\nto be usef=\r\nul for generating *unit* tests... unless you are dealing with\nvery junior d=\r\nevelopers who have been given a rigid spec for the 10 line\nmethod that they=\r\n need to write... and I would argue that the architect\nshould just have wri=\r\ntten the 10 lines themselves rather than the 3 page\nspec ;-)\n\n-Stephen\n\n\n&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; -Teemu\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt;\n\r\n--047d7b2e3f34d5eb9a04f1914877\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=ISO-8859-1\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;div dir=3D&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div class=3D&quot;gmail_extra&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div class=3D&quot;gmail=\r\n_quote&quot;&gt;On 4 February 2014 00:58, Teemu Kanstr=E9n &lt;span dir=3D&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;&lt;a=\r\n href=3D&quot;mailto:tkanstren@...&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;tkanstren@...&lt;=\r\n/a&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt; wrote:&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;blockquote class=3D&quot;gmail_quote&quot; style=3D&quot;margin=\r\n:0px 0px 0px 0.8ex;border-left-width:1px;border-left-color:rgb(204,204,204)=\r\n;border-left-style:solid;padding-left:1ex&quot;&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n&lt;div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n\n\n\n&lt;div dir=3D&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=3D&quot;gmail_extra&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div class=3D&quot;g=\r\nmail_quote&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=3D&quot;im&quot;&gt;On 3 February 2014 07:57, Stephen Connolly &lt;s=\r\npan dir=3D&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;&lt;a href=3D&quot;mailto:stephen.alan.connolly@...&quot; targ=\r\net=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;stephen.alan.connolly@...&lt;/a&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt; wrote:&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;b=\r\nlockquote class=3D&quot;gmail_quote&quot; style=3D&quot;margin:0px 0px 0px 0.8ex;border-le=\r\nft-width:1px;border-left-color:rgb(204,204,204);border-left-style:solid;pad=\r\nding-left:1ex&quot;&gt;\n\n\n&lt;u&gt;&lt;/u&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;div&gt;\n&lt;span&gt;=A0&lt;/span&gt;\n\n\n&lt;div&gt;\n  &lt;div&gt;\n=\r\n\n\n    &lt;div&gt;\n      \n      \n      &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div dir=3D&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Quality tests =\r\nare about meaningful test names and small test case size with at most 1-2 a=\r\nsserts per test case.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div=\r\n&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Nice ideal.

Which of your interpretation of system inte=\r\nnt is at fault is then to be investigated..&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;=\r\n/blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Quis custodiet ipsos custodes?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Who will guard the guards?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;If you gen=\r\nerate code tests from a specification, that is great. We now know that the =\r\ncode implements the specification correctly... we have guards that check th=\r\ne code... but who will check that the guards are enforcing the correct thin=\r\ngs?&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I would argue that it is somewhat easier to v=\r\nerify code than verify a specification... at least for a lot of the specifi=\r\ncations you will see out there.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Some specification=\r\ns are use-case based, with wooly descriptions of behaviour. These tend to g=\r\nenerate example based test-cases... which give good confidence that the use=\r\n-case(s) are met... but no confidence when you walk off the tested path.&lt;/d=\r\niv&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Some specifications mix requirements with design, e=\r\n.g. the UML based type.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I think you can generate t=\r\nest cases for a parser based on the specification of the grammar that it is=\r\n required to parse.&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I think you can generate test=\r\n cases for a performance specification...&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;But most=\r\n of the rest of the time the specification is just too high a level to be u=\r\nseful for generating *unit* tests... unless you are dealing with very junio=\r\nr developers who have been given a rigid spec for the 10 line method that t=\r\nhey need to write... and I would argue that the architect should just have =\r\nwritten the 10 lines themselves rather than the 3 page spec ;-)&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;=\r\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;-Stephen&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;=A0&lt;/div&gt;&lt;blockquote class=3D&quot;gmail_quote=\r\n&quot; style=3D&quot;margin:0px 0px 0px 0.8ex;border-left-width:1px;border-left-color=\r\n:rgb(204,204,204);border-left-style:solid;padding-left:1ex&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div dir=\r\n=3D&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;\n&lt;div class=3D&quot;gmail_extra&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=3D&quot;gmail_quote&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=\r\n=3D&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=3D&quot;#888888&quot;&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;-Teemu=A0&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/=\r\nspan&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=3D&quot;im&quot;&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;br&gt;\n\n\n&lt;br&gt;\n\n\n\n\n&lt;div width=\r\n=3D&quot;1&quot; style=3D&quot;color:white;clear:both&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;=\r\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\r\n--047d7b2e3f34d5eb9a04f1914877--\r\n\n",
