It would be harder to g=\r\net to full implementation, perhaps, but I think much more powerful in the l=\r\nong run.\n\nRight now, a lot of effort is put into collecting the right class=\r\nes to run for a test. JUnit at its core has its way (basically spelling the=\r\nm all out in a Suite or on the command line), ANT has its own runner, as do=\r\nes Maven. IDEs do something else, again introducing their own runner.\n\nIt w=\r\nould seem to be more powerful/better if the JUnit framework itself provided=\r\n the uber-Runner that others could hook into to provide providers for colle=\r\ncting the tests and receive information to capture results, so that all sys=\r\ntems are running the same overall framework and individual needs can be rel=\r\niably plugged into it.\n\nThis way if a system (say ANT or an IDE) needs to b=\r\ne able to handle capturing results, they don&#39;t also have to provide the gat=\r\nhering capabilities. Those gathering capabilities can be something standard=\r\nized (I think we need something more than just listing them that JUnit prov=\r\nides now, either slurping up class files from specified directories as ANT =\r\ndoes, or something that examines all available classpaths like IDEs do).\n\nI=\r\nf something like that existed, then the fact that Maven is running the test=\r\ns wouldn&#39;t matter because JUnit would still be able to take the additional =\r\nresult capturing mechanism required by your TestUI.\n\nI don&#39;t think the abov=\r\ne (long winded) statement is that different from what you are saying, I&#39;m j=\r\nust suggesting the relationship between the components be better mapped, mo=\r\nre formal, than a feature stuck in here or there to hook into a different r=\r\nunner.\n\nYishai\n\n--- In junit@yahoogroups.com, Daniel Brolund &lt;daniel.brolun=\r\nd@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Ok, I tried to sum things up.

BUT in some cases this solution\n&gt; &gt; can be a=\r\n desirable one. Therefore I think this solution, along with others\n&gt; &gt; (see=\r\n below) should be provided.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; My current need for global rules is=\r\n:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; - I am developing a Swing console, called TestUI, that will allow y=\r\nou to\n&gt; &gt; visually see the results of your tests, the tests that failed and=\r\n those that\n&gt; &gt; succeeded. You will also be able to specify a path to watch=\r\n for Surefire\n&gt; &gt; reports, therefore combining analytical functions with re=\r\nport functions (the\n&gt; &gt; report functions are those for which I need global =\r\nrules).\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; @David: I took a look at RunListener, and indeed it sol=\r\nves my problem\n&gt; &gt; (just like a TestWatchman-derived rule would), except th=\r\nat it is very\n&gt; &gt; inconvenient to use. For example, at work I have 110 modu=\r\nles, and a total\n&gt; &gt; number of 800 unit tests. I would like to globally hoo=\r\nk up my\n&gt; &gt; TestUIAgentRule, to report to my TestUI console each test that =\r\nis executed.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I execute the tests from Eclipse or from Maven, du=\r\nring build sessions.\n&gt; &gt; Therefore I cannot use RunListener or a Rule for t=\r\nhis. I need some global\n&gt; &gt; mechanism to enable a Rule for all the executed=\r\n tests.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Except for JVM params, here is another idea: having a j=\r\nunit\n&gt; &gt; properties/XML configuration file. It has been suggested on this m=\r\nessage\n&gt; &gt; group that junit should have a configuration file, and I am PRO =\r\nthis\n&gt; &gt; solution.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; In such a config file (available soomewhere =\r\nin the classpath, like the\n&gt; &gt; log4j.properties), we could specifiy:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n- which tests to execute/exclude/ignore\n&gt; &gt; &gt; - global rules\n&gt; &gt; &gt; - test s=\r\nuites to run/exclude\n&gt; &gt; &gt; - categories to run/exclude\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; This cou=\r\nld also solve this problem:\n&gt; &gt; http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/junit/me=\r\nssage/22184. The request here\n&gt; &gt; (read the first post in the thread) asks =\r\nfor a GUI where unit tests could be\n&gt; &gt; disabled, like light bulbs (PS: my =\r\nTestUI console will be able to do this,\n&gt; &gt; sometime in the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; future re=\r\nleases).\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; What do you think of this?\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Cheers,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; B=\r\nogdan\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; --- In junit@yahoogroups.com &lt;junit%40yahoogroups.com&gt;, J=\r\noakim Ohlrogge\n&gt; &gt; &lt;joakim.ohlrogge@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Hi Bogdan,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; I can see where you&#39;re coming from with system properties to solve=\r\n this.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; I would much rather have some way of solving this where you w=\r\nould not\n&gt; &gt; have\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; to rely on a property being set at the JVM-level. =\r\nThe reason is that\n&gt; &gt; it&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; very inconvenient to have to set run par=\r\nameters if you just want to\n&gt; &gt; rerun a\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; single test (in eclipse that=\r\n&#39;s a run configuration rather than just\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; rightclicking on a test in t=\r\nhe runner).

To have the rule working in sever=\r\nal\n&gt; &gt; tests,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; you have to place the Rule in each test.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; However, I am searching for a way to activate a Rule for all the=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; tests\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; that are executed, without needing to add the rule to e=\r\nach test.\n&gt; &gt; Perhaps by\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; specifying a Java property parameter when=\r\n running the tests (I could\n&gt; &gt; also\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; set this as a global Java opt=\r\nion, therefore being used upon each\n&gt; &gt; execution\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; of the JVM).\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Do you know if this is possible?\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; T=\r\nhe reason why I need this, is: I am making the plans and gathering\n&gt; &gt; the\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; ideas for creating a simple Swing application that will display th=\r\ne\n&gt; &gt; results\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; of the executed tests (just like the JUnit view in\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; Eclipse/Idea/Netbeans,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; but perhaps with more details, and also =\r\navailable for anyone, not just\n&gt; &gt; IDE\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; users). Currently I develop=\r\ned a small agent rule, that you can place\n&gt; &gt; in your\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; test, and it=\r\n will report to the console the status of your tests (the\n&gt; &gt; Swing\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt; console runs remotely).\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; This is ok, but it means th=\r\nat you will have to add this rule to each\n&gt; &gt; and\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; every test that =\r\nyou have. It also means that will not be an easy task\n&gt; &gt; to\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; disab=\r\nle this rule, if you don&#39;t want it anymore.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Therefore=\r\n a possibility to enable Rules globally for all tests I\n&gt; &gt; think is\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; the best solution for my case, and also a good tool to have for\n&gt; &gt; vari=\r\nous\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; other tasks.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; What do you think?
