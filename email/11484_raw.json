No. But you may learn something by doing this way to start.\n\nPeople often ask, &quot;Do I need to write all these tests?&quot; We usually \nanswer, &quot;Only if you want the code to work.&quot; Until you know better (have \nmore experience), it is worthwhile to write more tests than fewer tests.\n\nThat said, if you notice that ten tests do essentially the same thing, \nthen you have uncovered some duplication in your production code! If you \ncan remove the duplication, then you can reduce the number of tests, \npossibly down to one. This is a very common pattern in adding tests to \ncode without tests.\n\nThe Data Access Object is a perfect example of a class that tends to \nhave /massive amounts/ of duplication, making it look more difficult to \ntest than it could be. I write about this in chapter 10 of _JUnit \nRecipes_. (www.manning.com/rainsberger)\n\nI also write about how to organize test cases into fixtures (= test case \nclasses) in chapter 3.\n\nYour line of thinking is good: one test case class per /method/ being \ntested. Try it. I don&#39;t recommend using numbers in the names. Instead, \ntry these test case class names:\n\nSamuraiDAOFightTest\nSamuraiDAOMeditateTest\n...\n\nYou&#39;ll notice some duplication. Use the usual techniques (Extract \nMethod, Extract Superclass) to remove that duplication. If you&#39;re not \nfamiliar with refactoring, then buy a copy of &quot;Refactoring: Improving \nthe Design of Existing Code&quot; /now/. Don&#39;t look at the price of the book. \nIt&#39;ll return its value in the first week.\n\nGood luck.\n-- \nJ. B.
