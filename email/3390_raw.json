I get as far as having written all the code in stage 1 and\nthen when I go to run my first test I can&#39;t because I can&#39;t compile\nanything?  It says to enter the class name in the swing interface but I\ncannot create the MoneyTest.class file because it won&#39;t compile for me even\nthough I have the import statement right and the jar in the classpath...!!\n\nCan anybody please help as the document tells you nothing it just says,\n&quot;type the name of the test class in the window and press run&quot;  but it does\nnot say how to create the class first!!  \n\nThanks in advance,\nAndoni.\n\n",
