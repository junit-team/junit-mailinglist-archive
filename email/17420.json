I don&#39;t think you meant that, but it was the first thought<br/>\nthat came to my mind.<br/>\n<br/>\nI like to think that I consider my tests carefully, so the combination<br/>\nof thought and test first and then code must surely trump thought and<br/>\ncode, no?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Between &quot;Do the simplest thing that can possibly work&quot; (i.e. make a concrete<br/>\n&gt; class and get the test to pass as soon as possible) and &quot;Use an interface<br/>\n&gt; for future ease of testing and maintenance&quot;, I usually go for the latter<br/>\n&gt; because in my experience, it leads to cleaner design.  This is one of the<br/>\n&gt; many examples where test-driven design is sometimes the wrong thing to do.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Who said that a test has to be welded to only one class? TDD does not<br/>\npreclude using interfaces. A test is more a matter of a programmer<br/>\nthinking &quot;how do I want to call to receive the desired<br/>\nfunctionality?&quot;. The programmer might decide that an interface is<br/>\nexactly what needs to be used to call the method, and the test would<br/>\nreflect that. To satisfy that test, the programmer would then create a<br/>\ncouple of classes, one of which would be the interface that they<br/>\ndecided would be part of the calling signature. (Remember, TDD is not<br/>\nXP, you don&#39;t have to follow YAGNI.)<br/>\n<br/>\nSimon<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nwww.simonpeter.org</div>",
