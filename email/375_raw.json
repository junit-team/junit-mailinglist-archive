Unfortunately, I&#39;m running this on an NT\nplatform.  I should have mentioned my platform.  Sorry.\n\nLet me ask this.  Where can I get the apis and source for the\nTestRunners?  I don&#39;t see it in the downloads.  Is it in the CVS? I\nhaven&#39;t used CVS before, but I will if I need to.  Can anyone point\nme to where I might get this?  (Did I miss something in the\ndownload?)  I&#39;m using JUnit 3.5.\n\nThanks.\nPerry Tew\n\n\n--- Joi Ellis &lt;joi@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; On Fri, 2 Feb 2001 perry.tew@... wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Hello.  I&#39;m learning junit, and I&#39;m working through one of the\n&gt; tutorials\n&gt; &gt; listed on junit.org titled &quot;Incremental development with Ant and\n&gt; JUnit&quot;.\n&gt; &gt; The problem I&#39;m having is that when I run ant, my junit reports\n&gt; an error,\n&gt; &gt; but ant reports an overall success.  If I add a System.exit(1) to\n&gt; the end of\n&gt; &gt; my main method in my Test program, ant reports a FAILURE.  I&#39;m\n&gt; following the\n&gt; &gt; tutorial as it&#39;s written, but I can&#39;t seem to make ant fail when\n&gt; junit does.\n&gt; &gt; Would someone please look at my build.xml (trimmed), junit code,\n&gt; and my\n&gt; &gt; output and see if I&#39;m making a mistake somewhere?\n&gt;  \n&gt; I don&#39;t know if this is the problem you&#39;re having, but there is an\n&gt; open\n&gt; issue on Sun&#39;s Bug Parade about System.exit() not passing its\n&gt; parameter\n&gt; back to the platform.  At all.  It&#39;s been causing lots of problems\n&gt; for\n&gt; people calling 1.3&#39;s javac from makefiles.\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; http://developer.java.sun.com/developer/bugParade/bugs/4388732.html\n&gt; \n&gt; Apparently this is a glibc issue most often seen on Red Hat 7.0.\n&gt; \n&gt;   http://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=23758\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Perhaps one of these issues is causing your Ant/Junit combination a\n&gt; similar headache.\n&gt; -- \n&gt; Joi Ellis                    Software Engineer\n&gt; Aravox Technologies          joi@..., gyles19@...\n&gt; \n&gt; No matter what we think of Linux versus FreeBSD, etc., the one\n&gt; thing I\n&gt; really like about Linux is that it has Microsoft worried.
