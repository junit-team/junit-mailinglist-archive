Years ago<br/>\nFirearms were made by artisians called gunsmiths. Each part was custom<br/>\nfitted<br/>\nand took many hours to make.  Each firearm was different, not &#39;uniform&#39;.<br/>\nWhen<br/>\nsomething broke then it required another artisian to repair or make a new<br/>\npart.<br/>\nThen Mr Whitney decided to bring &#39;uniformity&#39; to the process.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow correct me if I am wrong (I&#39;m sure you will) but better software<br/>\ndevelopment<br/>\nis about<br/>\n<br/>\ndefinable, documentable interfaces,<br/>\nmodularization,<br/>\ntesting ... repeatable testing,<br/>\nframeworks,<br/>\npatterns,<br/>\ncomponents,<br/>\nautomated documentation<br/>\netc.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll of these concepts drive toward &#39;uniform&#39; results.  Even this newsgroup&#39;s<br/>\npurpose<br/>\nis about promotion of software that allows repeatable testing.  Better<br/>\nsoftware development<br/>\nis completely about bringing &#39;uniformity&#39; to the process.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you have a definition of &#39;better software&#39; then please supply it.  This<br/>\ndefinition<br/>\nhas to exist, otherwise, you have no standard to compare your latest project<br/>\nto validate<br/>\nthat it is better.  The feedback you are getting from this comparison will<br/>\nmake *gasp* your<br/>\nprocess better!<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you<br/>\n<br/>\nMichael Holly<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: J.
