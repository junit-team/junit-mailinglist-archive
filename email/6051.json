Typically with data driven testing you<br/>\n&gt; have one test method (or possibly a small set of methods) and each<br/>\n&gt; method runs many tests. The Junit TestCase class uses the method name<br/>\n&gt; as the test name and I would really like to have a unique name for<br/>\n&gt; each test (which is easy to provide in the test data.)

There are three ways to do this:<br/>\n1) Pass the name in via the constructor. This works well, because you<br/>\nare passing in lots of other stuff (the test data).<br/>\n2) Use the setName() method of JUnit 3.8<br/>\n3) Override the getName() method (just name() in earlier versions).<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, all of these techniques have a common problem: they cause the<br/>\ndefault implementation of TestCase.run() to break. This is because<br/>\nTestCase.run() uses the name to look up the test method via reflection.<br/>\nSo, if you&#39;ve changed the name, you need to change the TestCase.run()<br/>\nmethod as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nA quick read of the code for TestCase, and (to a lesser degree)<br/>\nTestSuite, will help you out here.<br/>\n<br/>\nRobert.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n               &quot;Software is too expensive to build cheaply&quot;<br/>\n  Robert Watkins                          email: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:robertdw@...\">robertdw@...</a></div>",
