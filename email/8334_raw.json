As you have mentioned in\n&gt; your reply, we need to write a getCount() mthod to get\n&gt; the value of the &quot;counter&quot;. We do not want to do this.\n&gt; Without &quot;GET&quot; method, is there any way we can get the\n&gt; value of the &quot;counter&quot;.\n&gt; Thanks\n&gt; Balakrishnan\n&gt; ================\n&gt; public void testIncrementBy() {\n&gt; &gt;         Counter counter = new Counter();\n&gt; &gt;         assertEquals(&quot;initial value&quot;, 0,\n&gt; &gt; counter.getCount());\n&gt; &gt;         \n&gt; &gt;         counter.incrementBy(5);\n&gt; &gt;         assertEquals(&quot;incremented value&quot;, 5,\n&gt; &gt; counter.getCount());\n&gt; \n\nI don&#39;t see exactly why you would want this.  Perhaps it&#39;s legacy code\nwhich you can&#39;t change?  In that case there are ways to get at private\ninternals.  If that&#39;s the case, search this group&#39;s archives for &quot;testing\nprivate&quot; and you should find your answer there.\n\nHowever, if you are designing the system from scratch you should have the\nflexibility to make it modular enough that you don&#39;t have to test without\nsome sort of getter method.  If your coding standard is simply to not\npollute the system with getters/setters then there MUST be some object\nsomewhere that will respond to the change resulting from the call to the\nvoid method.  There must be a way to test it in that case.  I would argue\nthough that the getter is probably not that bad of an idea -- it\nrepresents access to a data object, an object that holds some data\nrepresentative of a particular state -- therefore, you must have a way to\nget at that state/data.\n\nHope that helps,\n=jason\n\n--\n\n=jason\n[:question | ^One]\n\n",
