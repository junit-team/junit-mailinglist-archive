My point of contention is the case in which for\n&gt; &gt; every change I make to my class, I need to incorporate that change into\n&gt; &gt; the test class, if it is required. How can that be minimized?\n&gt;\n&gt; It sounds like you aren&#39;t doing test-first programming. If you were, then\n&gt; you&#39;d only have to change your class when a test failed. When you want to\n&gt; add a feature, you write a test, run it, and fix any code that breaks.\n\nWow, my response was not very clear at all. Let me try again:\n\nIf you were doing test-first programming, you wouldn&#39;t make a change to a\nregular class and then fix up the test classes.\n\nInstead, you&#39;d change a test class first, and then add/change the minimal\namount of code in the regular classes that is necessary to get the tests\nto pass.\n\nAnd if the tests are truly unit tests, a change in one class shouldn&#39;t\naffect too many tests.\n\n\nErik\n\n\n\n",
