Some &quot;OO&quot; programmers an=\r\nd many Java programmers don&#39;t get that that&#39;s a sign of *good* design. (It&#39;=\r\ns not a requirement of good design; it&#39;s a sign.)\n\nTake care.\n\n&gt;So said Kat=\r\nie Gerg on 4/16/2003 --------------------\n&gt;I&#39;ll have to take a look at the =\r\nTestRunner again.  I looked at the textui\n&gt;classes, ResultPrinter and TestR=\r\nunner.  ResultPrinter implements\n&gt;TestListener, The TestRunner class extend=\r\ns BaseTestRunner, which in turn\n&gt;implements TestListener - my head then exp=\r\nloded - just kidding.    At any\n&gt;rate, I just by passed the runner and had =\r\nthe listener keep track of all\n&gt;the\n&gt;results, names, error/failure descript=\r\nions and detailed test case\n&gt;description in an object.\n&gt;\n&gt;I know this is a =\r\nhack so I intend to go back and look at it later.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;  -----Original Mess=\r\nage-----\n&gt;  From: J. B. Rainsberger [mailto:jbrains@...]\n&gt;  Sent: Tu=\r\nesday, April 15, 2003 05:18 PM\n&gt;  To: junit@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;  Subject: RE:=\r\n [junit] Identify name of the TestCase\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;  It sounds like all you needed=\r\n was to register a TestListener so that, for\n&gt;each test, you could collect =\r\nits name. What you do with those names\n&gt;afterward is totally up to the indi=\r\nvidual.\n&gt;\n&gt;  Writing the TestListener is nothing. Attaching the TestListene=\r\nr to the\n&gt;TestRunner may take some work. I&#39;ve never actually done it. I wou=\r\nld have to\n&gt;look at the code.\n&gt;\n&gt;  I suppose you could have written your ow=\r\nn TestRunner that instantiates\n&gt;the\n&gt;text runner, adds the listener, asks t=\r\nhe text runner to run the tests, then\n&gt;processes the results from your list=\r\nener. Is this what you did? If not,\n&gt;then\n&gt;what did you do?\n&gt;\n&gt;  Thanks.\n&gt;\n=\r\n&gt;  &gt;So said Katie Gerg on 4/15/2003 --------------------\n&gt;  &gt;I&#39;m embarrasse=\r\nd to post it because I&#39;m really serious when I say I\n&gt;hacked\n&gt;  &gt;it.  I hav=\r\ne to get a suite of automated tests done by the end of this\n&gt;week\n&gt;  &gt;so I =\r\ndid it without completely understanding junit but I knew what I\n&gt;wanted\n&gt;  =\r\n&gt;to get out of it.  The tests I need to run are highly specialized\n&gt;(they&#39;r=\r\ne\n&gt;  &gt;the same with different inputs).\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt;I wanted a list of test cas=\r\nes so I know what test cases I&#39;ve run against\n&gt;a\n&gt;  &gt;build (hey I&#39;m a qa pe=\r\nrson, I have to know what&#39;s in there not only what\n&gt;  &gt;failed - esp. from a=\r\n test coverage perspective).  I also wanted it in a\n&gt;  &gt;format anyone could=\r\n easily view, so I store the test results in a vector\n&gt;  &gt;that I dump out i=\r\nn an html format at the end (the location is hardcoded\n&gt;for\n&gt;  &gt;now but it&#39;=\r\nll eventually come from a property file).\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt;Anyway, I confronted the=\r\n same issue you had with the listener so I made\n&gt;my\n&gt;  &gt;own testresult obje=\r\nct that the testcase class initializes and the\n&gt;listener\n&gt;  &gt;grabs it from =\r\nit.\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt;I&#39;ll send it to you but I don&#39;t think it fits into the junit w=\r\nay of\n&gt;  &gt;thinking.\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt;  -----Original Message-----\n&gt; =\r\n &gt;  From: Jesse Marlin [mailto:jlm@...]\n&gt;  &gt;  Sent: Tuesday, April =\r\n15, 2003 03:36 PM\n&gt;  &gt;  To: junit@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;  &gt;  Subject: RE: [junit=\r\n] Identify name of the TestCase\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt;  J.

Upload it to the file section. Get\n&gt;your\n&gt;  &gt;name in lights.\n&gt;  &gt;=\r\n\n&gt;  &gt;  I agree.  I am having a difficult time finding substantive examples,=\r\n\n&gt;  &gt;  and am currently struggling with TestListener.  I don&#39;t understand\n&gt;=\r\n  &gt;  the relationship between a TestResult and a TestCase.  TestResult\n&gt;  &gt;=\r\n  actually has the addListener method which I need, but I am not sure\n&gt;  &gt; =\r\n what to do to get a TestResult from the context of a TestCase.\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt;  =\r\n      Yahoo!
