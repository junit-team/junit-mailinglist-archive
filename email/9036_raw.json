When do y=\r\nou do it? What if you have a messaging system, which may process a message =\r\nbefore the first servlet loads?\n\nI agree that placing this in an applicatio=\r\nn server context makes it all the more difficult. One bad thing about appli=\r\ncation servers: there is no definite application object that starts before =\r\neverything else.\n\n&gt;- the setup of the Toolbox can become error prone (or at=\r\n least tedious) in\n&gt;complex test cases and during refactorings\n&gt;Maybe they =\r\nare experiences you (J.B. Rainsberg) could add to your article\n\nAll the mor=\r\ne reason why the toolbox must go. It is a coping mechanism for dealing with=\r\n many singletons, but not a final solution.\n\n&gt;I have been thinking for a wh=\r\nile if there could be any other way to solve\n&gt;the singleton &quot;testing proble=\r\nm&quot; and the only solution I came across is to\n&gt;implement a testing framework=\r\n where class loading is user-tailored:\n&gt;- in the source code there would no=\r\nt be any need to change the singleton\n&gt;code\n\nI dislike this in principle, b=\r\necause the choice to use a singleton is almost always the wrong choice. In =\r\ngeneral, I dislike anything that enables poor choices.\n\n&gt;- the tester class=\r\n would need to setup the framework so that the\n&gt;classloader would load a mo=\r\nck class instead of the singleton class\n\nInteresting. It could be another g=\r\nood coping strategy. A transition towards a more well-designed system.\n\n\nJ.=\r\n B.
