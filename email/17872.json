If the code was TDDed from the <br/>\nbeginning, the original developer likely would&#39;ve localized his or her <br/>\ncalls to System.exit(int).<br/>\n<br/>\nBut, that aside, I do think that people ought to be able to write tests <br/>\nfor code that exits.  And, I think that the should be able to do it  <br/>\nwithout having to think about writing security managers. They are a <br/>\nhigher level of voodoo than interfaces.  And, as I replied to Cedric, <br/>\nI&#39;m not even sure you can get the error return code to write decent tests.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s a lot of bad code out there.  We have to do things to make <br/>\nrecovery easier.<br/>\n<br/>\nMichael Feathers<br/>\nwww.objectmentor.com</div>",
