In my<br/>\n&gt;&gt;little Junit-misuse experiment I don&#39;t have such pre-defined hierarchy but<br/>\n&gt;&gt;only decide which tests need to be run when running them (so one test<br/>\n&gt;&gt;might dynamically add 3 other tests that need to be run).<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I have no idea as to whether or not this would work, but I have to ask <br/>\nwhy you would want to structure your tests in this fashion - aren&#39;t <br/>\ntests better designed as independent as possible of one another?</div>",
