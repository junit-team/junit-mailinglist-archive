You have to recompile your code\nwhen you want to change the test data. And another issue is\nthere are some features desired by developers while not\nincluded in the framework, you have to use extra extensions\nto do something such as logging, result recording...\n\nTo solve these problems, I create a new testing framework\nwhich separate test code and data, it&#39;s called &quot;Jetif&quot;.\nThe Jetif is designed for the purpose that to provides a\npowerful and flexiable testing framework with many of\nfeatures which developers desired.\n\nThere is a short article to compare Jetif and JUnit+JTestCase:\nhttp://jetif.sourceforge.net/comparison.html\n\nPlease visit http://sourceforge.net/projects/jetif/ \nfor more information.\n\nBest Regards\n-----------\nVicky Wang\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
