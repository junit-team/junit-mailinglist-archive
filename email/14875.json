That worked well when programs and data spent their entire<br/>\n&gt; lives on one computer, or perhaps a few computers all running the same<br/>\n&gt; OS. In the world of the Internet and Java, that&#39;s no longer true.<br/>\n&gt; Programs should explicitly specify the line separator character(s) they<br/>\n&gt; write or read. Their output should not vary from one platform to the next.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Well, that&#39;s an interesting choice. I might even make it, under enough<br/>\npressure.<br/>\n<br/>\nWouldn&#39;t it be good enough to provide a wrapper class for one&#39;s<br/>\noutput streams, which did the translation (or not) as required?<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nChris &quot;as graphite to diamond&quot; Dollin<br/>\nThe software engineer&#39;s song: &quot;who knows where the time goes&quot;.</div>",
