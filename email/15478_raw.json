So even if you have\n&gt; 100% code coverage there can still be nasty bugs lurking ....\n\n   Well, this is actually can be covered by the branch coverage (we \njust have to take into the account some implicit branches caused by \nexceptional execution flow), but it will obviously require more effort \nto handle all the branches.\n\n   From other hand we don&#39;t really have to cover parse method in your \nexample because exceptional case most likely will affect the caller \ncode and that is where erroroous outcome will caise most of the \ntroubles. Though it can be easily reproduced with mocks... but of \ncourse not for static methods. :-)\n\n   Using DFA (like it is done in Agitator) allows to have sort of \nshortcut that reduces number of hardly possible branches. That is why \nI felt it worth to mention it here.\n\n   regards,\n   Eugene\n\n\n&gt; From: junit@yahoogroups.com [mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com] On\n&gt; Behalf Of Eugene Kuleshov\n&gt; Sent: Monday, November 21, 2005 12:32 PM\n&gt; To: junit@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Subject: Re: [junit] coverage testing\n&gt; \n&gt; Kent,\n&gt; \n&gt; Aren&#39;t you guys doing this already in Agitator?\n&gt; \n&gt; regards,\n&gt; Eugene\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Kent Mitchell wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt;&gt; One other issue is that coverage (even path coverage) follows a\n&gt;&gt; classic interpretation of &quot;paths&quot; being based on the structure of\n&gt;&gt; the code.  But for an exception throwing language there is other\n&gt;&gt; possible &quot;paths&quot; that are triggered by behavior of the called\n&gt;&gt; code.  Consider:\n\n&gt;&gt; public static void int parse (String s) {\n&gt;&gt;   return Integer.parseInt(s);\n&gt;&gt; }\n&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Classically this has exactly one code path and gets 100% coverage\n&gt;&gt; if you pass in &quot;1234&quot; but behaviorally it has two paths because\n&gt;&gt; parseInt can throw an exception.  So ... you really need &quot;data\n&gt;&gt; coverage&quot; which is a nebulous concept to measure at best.\n&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Kent\n\n\n\n",
