To get a reference to RunNotifier, you&#39;ll\nneed to bypass JUnitCore and get straight to the Runner in your custom\nmain.  Take a look at JUnitCore.run(Runner) and let me know if that&#39;s\nhelpful.\n\nI assume your extension kept a persistent list of failed tests\nsomehow.  If so, you can use that in a Filter, comparing the names of\nthe failed tests to each method to decide which to run.\n\nSounds like interesting work--let me know how it goes.  Thanks,\n\n   David Saff\n\nOn 7/29/07, aviv_benyosef &lt;aviv.by@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Heya.\n&gt; In my workplace we&#39;ve had for quite some time a neat class that simply\n&gt; ran one of JUnit&#39;s runners and added some nice functionality - like\n&gt; catching SIGINT from the user and then telling JUnit to stop after the\n&gt; current test finishes.\n&gt;\n&gt; Now we&#39;re looking into making it work with JUnit4, and I see no nice\n&gt; way of doing it from outside the tests. I saw a thread here that\n&gt; showed a usage of RunNotifier.pleaseStop(), but I couldn&#39;t find a way\n&gt; to get a RunNotifier outside of a runner.\n&gt; Is there a way?\n&gt;\n&gt; Also, it has a nice feature of resuming the last failed test. How can\n&gt; this be done in JUnit4?\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks a lot,\n&gt; Aviv.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo! Groups Links\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n",
