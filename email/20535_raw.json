This feature has been\n&quot;on the list&quot; for at least eight of the ten years JUnit has been in\nexistence. The problem is that I have never found a way to add it without\nbreaking the architecture. For me, the additional ugliness has always\noutweighed the additional utility. I&#39;m open to suggestions, though.\n \nRegards,\n \nKent Beck\nThree Rivers Institute\n\n  _____  \n\nFrom: junit@yahoogroups.com [mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com] On Behalf Of Phil\nSurette\nSent: Monday, June 09, 2008 4:24 AM\nTo: junit@yahoogroups.com\nSubject: [junit] A case for adding logging of assertions to junit\n\n\n\nI&#39;d like to make a case for adding logging of assertions into junit.\nI&#39;ve been using junit for many years, and something that I&#39;ve found\nboth for myself and for people who I&#39;ve mentored in XP practices is\nthat it is often helpful to get warm fuzzy feedback that your tests\nare running and asserting what you think they are asserting. \n\nI notice that I&#39;m not alone in this; I see there are several threads\nwhere people were looking for this feature\n(http://tech. &lt;http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/junit/message/17845&gt;\ngroups.yahoo.com/group/junit/message/17845 &quot;how to log\njunit tests&quot;, http://tech.\n&lt;http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/junit/message/18762&gt;\ngroups.yahoo.com/group/junit/message/18762\n&quot;junit 4 & logging&quot;,\nhttp://tech. &lt;http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/junit/message/12000&gt;\ngroups.yahoo.com/group/junit/message/12000 &quot;Log4J Logging\nin JUnit&quot;)\n\nConsider the following concocted unit test. It is not the purpose of\nthis test case to demonstrate good test case design ;)\n\n1 public class MyTest extends junit.framework.TestCase{\n2 List&lt;Map&gt;; mapList;\n3 \n4 protected void setUp() throws Exception {\n5 //create some silly data\n6 Map map1 = new HashMap();\n7 map1.put(&quot;id&quot;, &quot;vladimir&quot;);\n8 Map map2 = new HashMap();\n9 map2.put(&quot;id&quot;, &quot;estragon&quot;);\n10 Map map3 = new HashMap();\n11 //might have to wait for a while for this one :)\n12 map3.put(&quot;id&quot;, &quot;godot&quot;);\n13 mapList = new ArrayList();\n14 mapList.add(map1);\n15 mapList.add(map2);\n16 mapList.add(map3);\n17 }\n18 \n19 public void testMapIds(){\n20 assertTrue(&quot;mapList has content&quot;, mapList.size() &gt; 0);\n21 for (Map map: mapList){\n22 assertNotNull(&quot;map has id field&quot;, map.get(&quot;id&quot;));\n23 }\n24 }\n25 \n26 public void testIdFormat(){\n27 //at some point this will test that all ids are\nlowercase...\n28 }\n29 \n30 public void testIdLengths(){\n31 assertTrue(&quot;mapList has content&quot;, mapList.size() &gt; 0);\n32 for (Map map: mapList){\n33 String id = (String)map.get(&quot;id&quot;);\n34 assertTrue(&quot;id &quot;+id+&quot; at least 8 characters long&quot;,\nid.length() &gt;=8);\n35 }\n36 }\n37 }\n\nWhat I would like to be able to do is to turn on some kind of\nassertion logging that would allow me to see output such as the following:\n(Note that this output was generated using my own tweaked\nversion of junit that uses log4j logging categories for\nenabling/disabling both assertion logging and test summary logging):\n\nINFO junit.echo.run.start - __BEGIN MyClassTest.testMapIds__\nDEBUG junit.echo.assertTrue - (passed) mapList has content \nDEBUG junit.echo.assertNotNull - (passed) map has id field vladimir\nDEBUG junit.echo.assertNotNull - (passed) map has id field estragon\nDEBUG junit.echo.assertNotNull - (passed) map has id field godot\nINFO junit.echo.run.summary - __SUMMARY MyClassTest.testMapIds__ (4\nasserts)\nINFO junit.echo.run.start - __BEGIN MyClassTest.testIdFormat__\nWARN junit.echo.run.summary - __SUMMARY MyClassTest.testIdFormat__ &lt;a\nid=&quot;bogus&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;(???no asserts???)\nINFO junit.echo.run.start - __BEGIN MyClassTest.testIdLengths__\nDEBUG junit.echo.assertTrue - (passed) mapList has content\nDEBUG junit.echo.assertTrue - (passed) id vladimir at least 8\ncharacters long\nDEBUG junit.echo.assertTrue - (passed) id estragon at least 8\ncharacters long\nDEBUG junit.echo.assertTrue - (FAILED) id godot at least 8 characters long\nWARN junit.echo.run.summary - __SUMMARY MyClassTest.testIdLengths__\n(4 asserts) ASSERTION FAILED id godot at least 8 characters long\n\nBeing able to see output like this has a number of benefits such as\n\n1) eliminating redundant logging statements - Many logging statements\nin a JUnit test case simply output information that you&#39;ve already\ntold JUnit about in your assertions. Developers often put these in as\na &#39;sanity check&#39; to verify that the test is doing what they expected.\nFor example: because on lines such as line 22 I can see the toString\nof the object that is not null, I get a warm fuzzy feeling that the\ntest is sane when I look at the logged results. I&#39;ve noticed that when\ndevelopers write their tests they often add log statements or\nSystem.outs to provide them this warm fuzzy feeling (often deleting\nthe same logging when the test is complete - and putting them back in\nwhen debugging test failures)\n\n2) improving assertion messages - it&#39;s often the case that the\nfirst time you see the message for an assertion will be when the\nassertion fails, which may not happen until you run a regression test\nmany moons after you coded the test. Unless you see the message\ndisplayed when you are developing the test, you won&#39;t realize that the\nmessage - if you provided one - is not be very helpful. Better\nassertion messages also help to communicate to a developer what the\npoint of the assertion is both when it fails and when reading the test.\n\n3) see finer-grain test results. Every assertion is a mini-test on its\nown, but JUnit these mini-tests are invisible until they fail. \nOf course, most of the time that&#39;s the behaviour you want. But\nwhen you&#39;re developing a test or debugging a test failure, it&#39;s\ngreat to see what these smaller tests are doing.\n\n4) by making logging easy, it can help to avoid the\nusing-system-outs-instead-of-asserts syndrome, where new junit test\nwriters will write &quot;test cases&quot; that actually just write a bunch of\nstuff to the console that the test writer then eyeballs for expected\nresults\n\nNotice that in the output above, there are also &#39;summary&#39; lines which\nshow how many assertions were made in a particular test. These are\nsomewhat tangential to the main thread of this post, but it&#39;s nice to\nbe able to know how many assertions occur in a test case if only to\nidentify when a test case is written that never actually makes an\nassertion - which is often a bad smell in a test case. It&#39;s also nice\nwhen there is a test failure during a build run to see in a log the\nstart of the test case and the assertions that passed before the\nfailure occurred.\n\nThere are some problems with logging assertions that I have encountered:\n\n1) if iterating over a collection and asserting each element, your log\ncan be overwhelmed. Maybe it would be useful to have some way of\nhinting that a particular assertion should not create notifications;\nmaybe not.\n\n2) the implementation I wrote creates a dependency on log4j (perhaps\nthis could be avoided by using a notification mechanism and shipping a\nseparate component that listens for logging notifications and logs them)\n\nBTW, From my own experience in instrumenting junit 3.8.1 \n(some time ago) I found that it is not a trivial thing to modify \njunit to do this kind of logging. For instance, in my\nown implementation I managed to confuse junit so it no longer reports\njunit failures differently than errors. It is a\nsignificant effort to do this badly, and much more effort to do it\nwell ;).\n\nIs there any appetite out there for adding assertion logging (or\nassertion notification) into the junit 4 framework? I would be\nhappy to do the work if I thought it would be accepted into the\nmain junit distribution. Or maybe this capability already exists\nin some way in junit 4 that I am not aware of?\n\n\n\n \n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n",
