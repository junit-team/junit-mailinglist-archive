Please let me know how can we over ride the runners fo=\r\nr a specific test case.\n\nThanks\nRajesh\n--- In junit@yahoogroups.com, &quot;p.lip=\r\ninski&quot; &lt;p.lipinski@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi\n&gt; Some time ago I&#39;ve written a runner=\r\n for JUnit which is a replacement for the standard Parameterized runner - i=\r\ns easier & more flexible to use, gives nicer output in IDEs.
