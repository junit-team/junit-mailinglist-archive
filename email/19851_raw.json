I understand you are\n&gt; currently doing this as an exercise, so it&#39;s healthy to take it to\n&gt; extremes and do everything by the book in order to learn, but in your\n&gt; real work, use your judgment and decide for yourself when you are\n&gt; indeed writing too much code, in which case it&#39;s probably safer to go\n&gt; the usual route (get your code to work, then write tests for it).\n&gt; \n&gt; The downside of TDD is that you can end up writing a lot of tests for\n&gt; business code that you quickly throw away and rewrite, so the amount\n&gt; of churn can be quite high.\n\nI&#39;m surprised that you quickly throw away business code and rewrite it \nwhen you have tests. Why wouldn&#39;t you refactor it?\n\nIncidentally, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s wise to tell a novice to &quot;use your \njudgment and decide for yourself&quot; about the areas in which the novice is \nlearning. If their judgment in that area were sound, they wouldn&#39;t ask \nsuch elementary questions, on average.\n-- \nJ. B.
