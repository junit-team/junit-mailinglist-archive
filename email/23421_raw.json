to mean a set of data for an already existing\nparametrized\ntest and &quot;t=\r\nest&quot; for the method itself, which has already been written by the\n\ndevelope=\r\nr in the normal way - that is using TDD.\n\nUsing that terminology, I can see=\r\n some benefit in generating additional test\n\ncases for the preexisting test=\r\n, since there might be some situations that\nhave\nbeen missed in course of w=\r\nriting them. I think such an approach would always\nbe secondary to regular =\r\nTDD - at least in my own work - but it could be\nuseful.\n\nThis is something =\r\nlike the effect one gets already from &quot;surprising&quot;\ncombinations\nof Datapoin=\r\nts using Theories and it&#39;s easy to imagine a program that\ngenerated\nadditio=\r\nnal &quot;surprises.&quot;\n\nCharlie\n\nOn Fri, May 13, 2011 at 11:30 PM, Esko Luontola =\r\n&lt;esko.luontola@...&gt;wrote:\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Kalyan Kundu wrote on 13.5.2011 11:0=\r\n7:\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; First of all I know to know if\n&gt; &gt; there is any automated testcase=\r\n generator for jUnit(both 3 and 4)?\n&gt;\n&gt; There is at least this one:\n&gt; http:=\r\n//www.agitar.com/solutions/products/automated_junit_generation.html\n&gt;\n&gt; Per=\r\nsonally I wouldn&#39;t use any test generation, because a human is needed\n&gt; to =\r\nwrite tests which communicate well the intent of the behaviour being\n&gt; spec=\r\nified by the code [1]. Neither could it be used to drive the design\n&gt; of th=\r\ne production code.\n&gt;\n&gt; Also I have my doubts that how useful such tools wou=\r\nld be in dealing\n&gt; with legacy code [2], when the code to be tested has non=\r\n-trivial\n&gt; dependencies. If the class is easy enough to cover with tests, t=\r\nhat even\n&gt; a program can do it, it would be easy for a human to write the s=\r\name\n&gt; tests. It would be a bit slower, but at the same time his understandi=\r\nng\n&gt; of the code would increase and he would be able to write more meaningf=\r\nul\n&gt; tests.\n&gt;\n&gt; Generating the production code based on the tests would be =\r\nmore\n&gt; interesting...
