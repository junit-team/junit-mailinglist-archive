HooohHahhh!<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>True doesn&#39;t generate tests, actually has nothing to do with tests,<br/>\njust statically analyzes the code.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;  Jimm in order for this to work the way it says it<br/>\n&gt;  works it has to parse source and store it in some<br/>\n&gt;  model.  Then analyze it...looks like using rule sets.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yes it does, it creates an AST and the rules can be written in java,<br/>\nor xpath if the rules are simple enough. I actually learned xpath with<br/>\nPMD and it works great :) Used it to find errorprone<br/>\nexception-handling for CMP:s in our codebase and guess what... I did<br/>\nfind some bugs.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  I&#39;m sure you could use the same model and rule sets<br/>\n&gt;  to generate tests (Just shooting from the hip.  I&#39;d have to look at it a<br/>\n&gt;  little more<br/>\n&gt;  to see whether I could come up with a concrete example. )<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Possibly, the parser is already in place so why not start in that end.<br/>\nYou may also want to check out javaCC and jjTreeif you want to parse<br/>\nJava.. it comes with a java 1.5 grammar in the examples. But maybe<br/>\nwhat Jimm wants to do can be expressed even with annotations?<br/>\n(I&#39;ve opened the parser can of worms enough times to have some respect<br/>\nfor that topic)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://pmd.sourceforge.net/\">http://pmd.sourceforge.net/</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  Thanks for letting me us Joakim.  Can&#39;t wait to<br/>\n&gt;  to hook it up to my maven projects.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>And don&#39;t forget to try the eclipse plugin aswell :)<br/>\nI hope that PMD will be as helpful to you as you seem to think it will<br/>\nbe. Good luck!</div>",
