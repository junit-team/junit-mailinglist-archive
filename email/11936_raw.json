One that we have been kicking around here in the \noffice this week as well. We have been using the term &quot;syntactically \ncorrect&quot; to indicate a document that would pass some kind of XML \nvalidation. However this does not mean the document makes sense in a \nbrowser - perhaps there are CSS mistakes or JavaScript mistakes, or \nbasic HTML mistakes. If a document does make sense in a browser, we have \nbeen calling it &quot;semantically correct&quot;.\n\nThese are probably not the best use of the terms &quot;syntax&quot; and \n&quot;semantics&quot; but it seems to convey the intended difference.\n\nAutomating the process of testing if a page is syntactically correct \nseems to be reasonably easy through the use of an XML parser.\n\nThe semantic checking is a much more interesting problem. Validating \nCSS, or JavaScript is probably doable. But in my experience the biggest \nproblem in testing a web application is the variety of browsers and OSs \nthat are out there and attempting to cover even a small set of these in \nQA is resource intensive. Small differences in rendering that need to be \ntweaked with custom CSS, or certain tags that a browser docent support, \nor keywords that mean something in one browser and not another.\n\nAnyone have any tools they use for this task? Are there any tools? Is it \neven reasonable to think that automation for this type of testing is \npossible?\n\n\nJ. B.
