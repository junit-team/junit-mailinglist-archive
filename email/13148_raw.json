Sure, I could\nextend TestCase to periodically call a function in its TestResult\n(oops, it has no reference to it!), which would then propogate to the\nTestListener, and then somehow output the data. But...no. That was SO\nmuch more work than it seemed like it should have been. Too many\nprivate elements, too much reflection.\n\nBut it seems like a useful feature. Perhaps one that others might have\nexplored in the past. Has anyone looked at this? Is there an extension\nout there that implements it?\n\nAaron\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
