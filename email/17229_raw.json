So they they must be distributing\ntheir\n&gt; code as a set of additional modules (jars, classes) on top of JUnit.\nBy\n&gt; my reading of the license ,they are not required to distribute the\n&gt; source to their work since it is not a &quot;contribution&quot; to the &quot;Program&quot;\n&gt; (i.e. JUnit). So they do have to make the source to JUnit available\n&gt; (which they seem to be complying with) but they do not have to make\nthe\n&gt; source code to their additions available.\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m not a lawyer but I do spend a fair amount of time looking at\nlicense\n&gt; agreements since our products incorporate open source so I&#39;ve gotten\n&gt; pretty good at reading these things over the years. Does anyone want\nto\n&gt; educate me on where I went wrong with my reasoning?\n&gt; \n&gt; Kent\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ________________________________\n&gt; \n&gt; From: junit@yahoogroups.com &lt;mailto:junit%40yahoogroups.com&gt;\n[mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com &lt;mailto:junit%40yahoogroups.com&gt; ] On\nBehalf Of\n&gt; David Saff\n&gt; Sent: Wednesday, July 26, 2006 11:25 AM\n&gt; To: junit@yahoogroups.com &lt;mailto:junit%40yahoogroups.com&gt; \n&gt; Subject: Re: [junit] Mobile JUnit\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Once you run the exe, which is a self-installer, you get, among other \n&gt; things, a text file stating:\n&gt; \n&gt;\n************************************************************************\n&gt; *\n&gt;\n************************************************************************\n&gt; *\n&gt; \n&gt; This Software includes unmodified JUnit binary code developed under\nthe\n&gt; Common Public License Version 1.0 (CPL).

Aren&#39;t they contravening the open\n&gt; &gt; source license of JUnit by producing their own extension and not\n&gt; &gt; making the source code available?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Your comments would be greatly appreciated :-)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Kind regards.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Jim.\n&gt; &gt;\n\n\n\n \n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n",
