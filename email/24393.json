I actually &quot;discovered&quot; rules during this exercise and spent some time changing legacy @Test(timeout = ...) tests to use a fixture-level Timeout @Rule.  However, I just assumed that the threading behavior between the two was the same. :(  Based on your information, I ran some more tests to nail down on which thread the various parts of the fixture are executed using both models.  The results are summarized below (from JUnit 4.8.2).<br/>\n<br/>\n    @Test with timeout element:<br/>\n        A1. ctor run on main thread<br/>\n        A2. @BeforeClass, @Before, @After, @AfterClass run on main thread<br/>\n        A3. @Test run on worker thread<br/>\n        A4. @After, @AfterClass run on main thread if test times out<br/>\n<br/>\n    Timeout @Rule:<br/>\n        B1. ctor run on main thread<br/>\n        B2. @BeforeClass, @AfterClass run on main thread<br/>\n        B3. @Before, @Test, @After run on worker thread<br/>\n        B4. @After NOT run if test times out<br/>\n        B5. @AfterClass run on main thread if test times out<br/>\n<br/>\nGiven these results, using Timeout @Rules satisfies my concerns about thread safety and gives me even more motivation to use them over @Test(timeout = ...).  Thanks!  (Note sure if item [B4] is intentional, but I can live with it for now.)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a>, David Saff &lt;saff@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; The biggest payoff would probably be to make sure that the<br/>\n&gt; documentation we have makes it easy to avoid any unexpected<br/>\n&gt; behavior.  Can you suggest an edit to that effect?<br/>\n<br/>\n@David: Your suggestion for updating the documentation is probably the best solution based on the preferred behavior of the Timeout @Rule.  Below is my cut at a second paragraph I&#39;d add to the Javadocs for the @Test annotation&#39;s timeout element.  Please edit as you see fit.<br/>\n<br/>\n    THREAD SAFETY WARNING.  Test methods with a timeout parameter are run in a thread other than the thread which runs the fixture&#39;s @Before and @After methods.  This may yield different behavior for code that is not thread safe when compared to the same test method without a timeout parameter.  Consider using the org.junit.rules.Timeout rule instead, which ensures a test method is run on the same thread as the fixture&#39;s @Before and @After methods.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks again for all the feedback,<br/>\nSteve </span></blockquote></div>",
