It serves a bucketload of use-case=\r\ns, some of which are *far* off from what I&#39;d do in my own tests. If the use=\r\nr decides to use loggers or system out is not really something we want to d=\r\nictate. \n\nAs a humoristic example, let me mention the issue we had on this =\r\nguy spawning threads from a test that were producing console output for the=\r\n entire test run that was collected by a JVM shutdown hook. \n\nKristian\n\n\n--=\r\n- In junit@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Georg&quot; &lt;le_garcon_enerve@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Dear =\r\nKristian,\n&gt; \n&gt; My first thought - and I hope not to sound arrogant - would =\r\nbe to \n&gt;  - to remove the the output altogether (who reads it anyhow once t=\r\nhe test is run successfully the first time ;-); if one needs to read the ou=\r\ntput of the test runs, what&#39;s the point of unit tests?!).\n&gt;  - or to conver=\r\nt it into assertions (they also work nicely in methods not marked with @Tes=\r\nt).\n&gt; \n&gt; If you still think you need the output, why not use a logger (log4=\r\nj), which adds all the information you need? Refactoring should be very eas=\r\ny.\n&gt; \n&gt; As I&#39;m starting to learn and play with AspectJ, I&#39;d try that (but w=\r\nould not bet money on this being a good idea). This would allow to intercep=\r\nt calls to System.out.print() and alike, and tweak it print the argument(s)=\r\n of the print()-statement augmented with the class to which the calling met=\r\nhod belongs.\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In junit@yahoogroups.com, kristian@ wrote:\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Sorry, I was doing just what I sometimes dislike of our own users ;=\r\n)\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The real problem I want to solve is associating console output f=\r\nrom a running thread to a given test-case (for parallel runs).

It works for=\r\n simple cases but with customized\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Runner-classes and new JUnit-feat=\r\nures (e.g. the introduction of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; JUnit-Rules) the result is usually b=\r\nad and it discourages the IDE users\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (i.e. the developers) from taki=\r\nng full advantage of JUnit!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; However, Maven (versions 2.0-2.=\r\n2) and its Surefire-plugin has handled the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; JUnit-integration wonder=\r\nfully, as far as I know, so your post worries me a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; little.
