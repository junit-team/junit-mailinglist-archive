We ended up doing our own Assert class whose \nroot method was this (there were convenience methods built on top of \nthis, so it didn&#39;t have to always be especially verbose):\n\nvoid assert(String passedMessage, String failedMessage, boolean \ncondition);\n\nOur TestRunner was altered to print these messages as they are being \nexecuted, along with the test name.  Be aware that I don&#39;t suggest doing \nthis for unit testing, as I believe the philosophy of only displaying \nresults when it breaks to be a good thing.   But for those doing things \nthat aren&#39;t necessarily unit testing, it has been extremely useful.  \nHere&#39;s a portion of the output:\n\nTestTestlets().testPassed(): [ PASSED 12/10/2001 02:18:28 ]\n  [ PASSED This will never fail ]\nTestTestlets().testFailed(): [ FAILED 12/10/2001 02:18:28 ]\n  [ FAILED This could never succeed ]\nTestTestlets().testTestletWithArgs(testing 1, 2, 3): [ PASSED 12/10/2001 \n02:18:28 ]\n  [ PASSED Msg does not equal null ]\n  [ got argument: &quot;testing 1, 2, 3&quot; ]\nTestTestlets().testPassed(): [ PASSED 12/10/2001 02:18:28 ]\n  [ PASSED This will never fail ]\nTestTestlets().testFailed(): [ FAILED 12/10/2001 02:18:28 ]\n  [ FAILED This could never succeed ]\nTestTestlets().testErrorReporting(): [ E R R O R 12/10/2001 02:18:28 ]\n  [ ERROR This an emergency error of your junit system ]\n\n-shane\n\nOn Saturday, December 8, 2001, at 08:07  AM, Mike Clark wrote:\n\n&gt; Sriram Anandraj wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Hi Robert/Vladimir,\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; You both r right.
