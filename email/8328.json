Rainsberger&quot;<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jbrains@...\">jbrains@...</a>&gt; said:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; You could also try reading the question. :) :) :)  That looks<br/>\n&gt; suspiciously like using a get method.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Well deserved...  I will answer less hastily in the future.<br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; To the OP, there are a number of ways to answer that question, depending<br/>\n&gt; on the actual design under test. If you can give us some information on<br/>\n&gt; what the &#39;void&#39; method does, we may have a suggestion for you.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I think JB&#39;s point of knowing what the void method is supposed to do is a<br/>\ngood one.  You don&#39;t have to give code, you could give psuedo-code.  In<br/>\nturn the answers you receive would probably be much better suited to you.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe general Observer/Observable pattern that JB referred to is good. <br/>\nHowever, that may introduce unnecessary overhead.  Every void method must<br/>\nhave some side effect on the system, otherwise it does nothing.  In<br/>\ngeneral, you should test for the side effect.  Though I gave an answer<br/>\nwith a getter, the point remains the same.<br/>\n<br/>\nTesting a logger is a good example.  Most likely the interface into the<br/>\nlogger is comprised of void methods (eg. debug(Object), info(Object),<br/>\ntrace(Object), etc.).  However, that logger must log out to something. <br/>\nIf you design it well enough you should be able to attach an arbitrary<br/>\nstream to the logger and check the stream for the contents you think<br/>\nshould be logged.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor a code example of testing void methods, you could also look at the<br/>\nlast several issues of Software Development magazine where Bob Martin is<br/>\ncontinuing a series on Test Driven Development.  As I recall, there are<br/>\nsome void methods in the server they are writing that are being tested<br/>\nwithout getters... but I could be wrong. :)<br/>\n<br/>\n=jason<br/>\n--<br/>\n<br/>\n=jason<br/>\n[:question | ^One]</div>",
