That said,<br/>\nit&#39;s likely to be at least a month or two before there&#39;s a finalized<br/>\nrelease that incorporates this.  In the meantime, would it make sense to<br/>\nadd a section to the wiki that explains how someone can use RuntimeSuite<br/>\nand the existing features of JUnit to get what Mark&#39;s team originally<br/>\nwanted in Eclipse/maven/command-line/etc?  The hope would be that this<br/>\nwould move at least a few teams from &quot;I give up&quot; to &quot;I&#39;m glad this will get<br/>\neasier, but at least we&#39;re up and running&quot;.  In the process of generating<br/>\nit, we might also unearth some corner cases that would nice to know before<br/>\nbaking things in (for example, will our recommended Eclipse solution work<br/>\nin the presence of tests loaded into OSGi containers?)<br/>\n<br/>\n   David Saff<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOn Mon, Jan 28, 2013 at 12:57 PM, Joakim Ohlrogge &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:joakim.ohlrogge@...\">joakim.ohlrogge@...</a><br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; **<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; About &quot;Before tackling new features let&#39;s make the basics simple&quot;.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; While I agree with most of the rest that was said I reacted negatively in<br/>\n&gt; the beginning to that statement in the context of Lambdas &quot;I&#39;m in shock,<br/>\n&gt; you&#39;re discussing how to use Lambda&#39;s well when some of the basic elements<br/>\n&gt; are hard to use correctly&quot;. It is simply a false dichotomy. It is not a<br/>\n&gt; matter of &quot;we should be doing this rather than that&quot;.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; In my experience Lambdas are a key to a great deal of simplicity. It&#39;s not<br/>\n&gt; really a new feature in the sense &quot;we can do new stuff&quot; as it is &quot;we can do<br/>\n&gt; stuff differently&quot;. Looking at lambdas certainly doesn&#39;t prevent fixing<br/>\n&gt; other things. More than anything from this discussion, when looking at<br/>\n&gt; JUnit5 in the light of java 1.8, one of the things that should be solved in<br/>\n&gt; &quot;core&quot; is categories (it seems).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",
