To use JUnit, <br/>\nyou need to separate the EJB into two parts: the plain Java part, and <br/>\nthe part that integrates with the EJB framework. See _JUnit Recipes_, <br/>\nchapter 11 for details.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Another question is with respect to UI testing.<br/>\n&gt; We found that Httpunit consumes lot of effort in writing the black<br/>\n&gt; box tests for testing UI.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>What are three ways in which using HttpUnit consumes so much effort?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; We also foundthat Cactus is not that useful for testing UI as it<br/>\n&gt; cannot do the navigational testing, i.e. navigating from one screen<br/>\n&gt; to another.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I find this surprising. If Vince Massol can read this, would you care to <br/>\ncomment?<br/>\n<br/>\nI have used HtmlUnit to test the user interface, but I have to tell you <br/>\nthat when I test a user interface, I test /only/ the user interface, and <br/>\nnot the entire application from end to end. You might be doing something <br/>\ndifferent. I find that testing the entire application from end to end <br/>\n/and/ trying to do exhaustive boundary checking is a formula for <br/>\ndisaster, so I use other techniques. Once again, see _JUnit Recipes_, <br/>\nchapters 12 and 13 for details.<br/>\n<br/>\nBest of luck.<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJ. B.
