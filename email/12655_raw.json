We run a nightlybuild regression, so the next morning I\ncan see if I missed anything (sometimes the failures are well\nremoved from the actual class that was changed).\n\nSo, we would like to be able to record historical data of the\nfluctuations.  In the past, manually, we have found that the\nerrors/failures go up when we get above a certain velocity.\n\nThanks for any insight that can be provided.\n\nDianne Doss\n\n\nDear Doss,\n\n              If you are generating JUnit Report through Ant, definitely you\nshould write one build.xml file. Before generating new report, why not you\ntake copy of the previous report.  In Ant API  contains copy tag and move\ntag. So\nfirst step you take a back up using Copy/ Move tag.\nSecond step you clear your old report using delete tag.\nThird step create report folder again.\nFinally you generate new report.\n\n\n\nPaul Domnic J.\n\nScandent Group\n4th Floor, KRM Centre,\nNo.2, Harrington Road,\nChetpet,\nChennai 600 031\nIndia\n\nTel:+91 44  5211 8090\nFax:+91 44  5211 8068\nImportant Email Information :- The  information  in  this  email is\nconfidential and may  be  legally  privileged.
