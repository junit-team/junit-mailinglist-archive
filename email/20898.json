If<br/>\nyou have a test suite where you can identify two disparate groups of<br/>\ntests that you would like to run separately, you obviously have two<br/>\nsuites in one file. <br/>\n<br/>\nI wrote a suite recently that tested a particular class containing both<br/>\nCRUD operations and single search operation. The search tests grew<br/>\nexponentially (as they tend to) and quickly outnumbered all the other<br/>\ntests combined! Eventually I had to concede that in that case it made<br/>\nsense for one suite to test everything but the search.... and another<br/>\nthat was just the search.<br/>\n<br/>\nGabriel.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",
