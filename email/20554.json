Are there tests without assertions? Are there tests with many<br/>\n&gt; assertions? etc.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Jester (http://jester.sourceforge.net) is pretty useful for getting a<br/>\nhandle on how good a set of unknown tests are and where problems lie.<br/>\nHowever, the analysis run taking a long time.   Ivan has written a<br/>\nsimple version that is very easy to run.  More info here:<br/>\nhttp://ivan.truemesh.com/archives/000725.html.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s a similar tool called Jumble that is much faster because it<br/>\nfiddles with bytecodes instead of rerunning the entire build after<br/>\nevery mutation.  However, that only works for tests that run within a<br/>\nsingle JVM and I&#39;ve not got it working with code that does bytecode<br/>\nfiddling of its own.<br/>\n<br/>\n--Nat</div>",
