So one writer \nthread has not died before the backups ends -&gt; there was a stream that \nwas not closed -&gt; the file could not deleted. But now i know that JUnit \ndefinitely does not spawn threads... :-)\n\nThank you all for your help!\n\nBest regards,\n\nNils\n\nAm 30.03.2011 11:31, schrieb Malte Finsterwalder:\n&gt;\n&gt; I have done similar tests, where I write a particular file to a\n&gt; directory and then did some processing on it.\n&gt; I never had a problem with this setup. And I did reuse the same\n&gt; directory location for all my tests.\n&gt; I did clean the directory in the @Before-method and in the\n&gt; @After-method (Using jakarta FileUtils).\n&gt;\n&gt; Standard JUnit does not spawn any threads, as far as I know. So the\n&gt; tests are run sequentially. Other runners could change this, of\n&gt; course.\n&gt; If your code spawns threads, that&#39;s a different matter of course.\n&gt; And from afar I would also suggest to check for files that where not\n&gt; properly closed.\n&gt;\n&gt; Greetings,\n&gt; Malte\n&gt;\n&gt; \n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n",
