Does the result of \nyour big method vary at all or is it dependent  solely on the state of \nthe variables after initialization?\n\nMichael Feathers\n\nedu_kumar wrote:\n\n&gt;Hi all, \n&gt;\n&gt;I&#39;ve been stuck with a problem, when i&#39;m unit testing my code. \n&gt;\n&gt;My problem is that i&#39;ve a really huge method,which calls several small\n&gt;methods ( methods so small, they&#39;re just getters for member\n&gt;variables), If i have to unit test this method, i&#39;ve to make sure all\n&gt;the small methods that it subsequently invoke, work as they&#39;re\n&gt;expected. But all my member variables get initialized seperately in a\n&gt;different method which is of no relation with the BIG method I wanted\n&gt;to test in the first place. \n&gt;\n&gt;Can I test my method without worrying about the initialization of my\n&gt;object&#39;s data, by mocking the results of all my getter methods ?  \n&gt;\n&gt;Ex: \n&gt;\n&gt;Class MyClass\n&gt;{\n&gt;   private Object _member; \n&gt;   public void initialize()\n&gt;   {\n&gt;     //huge initialization process, which initializes my member\n&gt;variables. \n&gt;      _member = new Object(); \n&gt;   }\n&gt;\n&gt;   public void myHugeMethod()\n&gt;   {\n&gt;       //.. my logic here.\n&gt;       Object m = getMember(); \n&gt;       //... proceed with this value. \n&gt;   }\n&gt;\n&gt;   public Object getMember()\n&gt;   {\n&gt;      return this._member; \n&gt;   }\n&gt;}\n&gt;\n&gt;Now, if I call &#39;myHugeMethod()&#39; without calling &#39;initialize()&#39; method,\n&gt;it always return NULL. \n&gt;\n&gt;All i wanted to do is to test &#39;myHugeMethod()&#39;, by mocking\n&gt;&#39;getMember()&#39; method and setting the result what i wanted. \n&gt;\n&gt;I tried using Jmock for creating mocks in my test case, but it fails\n&gt;because the mock object only knows what exactly I wanted to mock but\n&gt;nothing more than that. All my application logic is present in\n&gt;&#39;MyClass&#39; object not in its mock. \n&gt;\n&gt;How can I achieve this using Jmock ? \n&gt;\n&gt;FYI, I tried with a direct approach by extending &#39;MyClass&#39; and\n&gt;overriding the &#39;getMember()&#39; method in it. But I still feel there&#39;s a\n&gt;better way to do it. \n&gt;\n&gt;I&#39;ll be very thankful for any help in this regard.. \n&gt;\n&gt;Thanks in advance, \n&gt;Sarat kumar. \n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\n\n",
