Comments are not executable and cannot\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; fail if\n&gt;  &gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt;  &gt; they are wrong, so they are waste.\n&gt;  &gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; So code should never be commented??  This makes no sense.\n&gt; \n&gt; Telling people that code should not be commented, that comments are\n&gt; waste, remains extremely bad advice.\n\nYour opinion. Enjoy it.\n\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; *  fewer comments correlate well with more bugs\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; Fewer comments are generally not the cause, though: fewer comments\n&gt; \n&gt; &#39;Correlates with&#39; does not mean &#39;causes&#39;.\n\nI&#39;m pretty sure that&#39;s what *I* wrote.\n\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; *  as often as not, it&#39;s faster to rewrite uncommented code than it is\n&gt;  &gt; &gt;    to figure out what the code &quot;already says&quot;\n&gt;  &gt; &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; If the code is doing anything complex, if it is implementing rules\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; that contain domain-specific knowledge, comments are not waste --\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; they are absolutely essential.\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; Not essential, although they can help. If the code simply said what the\n&gt;  &gt; comments say, then they *would* be both the comments and the logic. It&#39;s\n&gt;  &gt; simply a matter of choosing better names and extracting methods where\n&gt;  &gt; appropriate.\n&gt; \n&gt; I really don&#39;t want to drag this out any further - but this makes no\n&gt; sense at all.\n\nI don&#39;t need to drag it out any further, because Martin Fowler did it \nalready in his Refactoring book as well as Jeff Langr in his Java Style \nbook.\n\n&gt; In the real world, \n\nI rarely resort to this kind of language, but fuck right off. You do not \nknow me. You do not know what I have and have not done in the &quot;real \nworld&quot;. It scares me that I used to be that arrogant; it&#39;s a shame that \nyou still are.\n\n &gt; [...] in most cases you can&#39;t explain your logic simply\n&gt; by choosing better variable names.  In most cases, you have to spell\n&gt; out why you are doing what you are doing.  Otherwise, whatever poor soul\n&gt; comes along a year or two later to fix your code is going to be lost.\n\nIs that so? It&#39;s a good thing I&#39;ve never delivered maintainable code (as \nin, the maintainers told me so) with less than one comment per thousand \nlines. It&#39;s another good thing I haven&#39;t done it many times.\n\nIf you change &quot;most&quot; to &quot;rare&quot;, then you&#39;re exactly right.\n\n&gt;  &gt; I&#39;m not saying that I don&#39;t know how to write printf() or use the\n&gt;  &gt; debugger. I just choose not to when I can write tests instead. It&#39;s\n&gt;  &gt; clear to me that tests provide the same benefits as printf() *and*\n&gt;  &gt; preserve what I have learn for posterity. &quot;It&#39;s no good to anyone else\n&gt;  &gt; in your head, Mozart. Write it down.&quot; (paraphrase of Salieri from the\n&gt;  &gt; film Amadeus.)\n&gt; \n&gt; Take your own advice.  Don&#39;t keep it in your head.  Comment your code.\n\nThe variable names and method names *are* my comments, and they also \npass tests! When was the last time a comment passed a test?\n\nBy the way, I think you&#39;re confusing &quot;comments&quot; with &quot;documentation.&quot; \nRoadmap-style documentation and test cases as sample code are much, much \nmore effective than code-level comments. Much.\n\nBut I won&#39;t drag this out any further. I see there would be no point.\n-- \nJ. B.
