Currently the TreeNode classes do <br/>\nnot expose their internals and if I have to navigate the tree from <br/>\nthe TestCase and validate values, I&#39;ll need to add these to the <br/>\ninterface.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut, doesn&#39;t this break encapsulation in a way? In this application, <br/>\nI do not think any other client classes will be interested in picking <br/>\nand choosing nodes and checking its contents. They would only send <br/>\nmessages to the TreeHolder and let the TreeHolder delegate it on.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother option is of course to make these additional methods package <br/>\naccessible ...<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks very much for your help. <br/>\n--Das<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In junit@y..., Johannes Link &lt;john.link@g...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; If the forwarding is anything but very very simple, I prefer to <br/>\ntest it.<br/>\n&gt; You can test (a) if the correct set of nodes has been chosen for<br/>\n&gt; forwarding (b) if the correct method in the nodes is called. IMO <br/>\nthis<br/>\n&gt; holds enough potential for (future) failure. <br/>\n&gt; To be frank, I personally test even the most trivial delegation <br/>\nmethod.<br/>\n&gt; With those tests in my back I haven&#39;t got to add many tests during<br/>\n&gt; refactoring. Adding lots of tests when refactoring breaks my flow.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Johannes </span></blockquote></div>",
