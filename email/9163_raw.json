Years ago\nFirearms were made by artisians called gunsmiths. Each part was custom\nfitted\nand took many hours to make.  Each firearm was different, not &#39;uniform&#39;.\nWhen\nsomething broke then it required another artisian to repair or make a new\npart.\nThen Mr Whitney decided to bring &#39;uniformity&#39; to the process.\n\nNow correct me if I am wrong (I&#39;m sure you will) but better software\ndevelopment\nis about\n\ndefinable, documentable interfaces,\nmodularization,\ntesting ... repeatable testing,\nframeworks,\npatterns,\ncomponents,\nautomated documentation\netc.\n\nAll of these concepts drive toward &#39;uniform&#39; results.  Even this newsgroup&#39;s\npurpose\nis about promotion of software that allows repeatable testing.  Better\nsoftware development\nis completely about bringing &#39;uniformity&#39; to the process.\n\nIf you have a definition of &#39;better software&#39; then please supply it.  This\ndefinition\nhas to exist, otherwise, you have no standard to compare your latest project\nto validate\nthat it is better.  The feedback you are getting from this comparison will\nmake *gasp* your\nprocess better!\n\nThank you\n\nMichael Holly\n\n\n\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: J. B. Rainsberger [mailto:jbrains@...]\nSent: Thursday, August 21, 2003 5:05 PM\nTo: junit@yahoogroups.com\nSubject: OT: The goals of CMM (Re: [junit] wanted Junit professionals\nurgently)\n\n\nMichael Holly wrote:\n\n&gt; What is wrong with the concept of a defineable, repeatable, managed,\n&gt; optimized software development\n&gt; process?\n\nProcess definitions don&#39;t write software; people do.\n\n &gt; Where would we be if Jules Verne had not dreamed of going to the\n&gt; moon? Or Columbus\n&gt; going to the New World?  Both events happened( regardless of what some\nsmall\n&gt; fringe group say ).\n\nI dream of someone giving me $10M, but that dream goes against basic\nhuman nature. That is why it remains a dream.\n\nThe dreams you mention here go *with* human nature -- namely the desire\nto explore -- and that helped make them happen.\n\n&gt; The point I&#39;m making is that if you do not have goals then you won&#39;t get\nthe\n&gt; benefits of reaching\n&gt; even part of your goal.\n\n From what I understand the goal of CMM is to define a process that even\na monkey could follow. Monkeys do not write software; people do.\n\n&gt; Don&#39;t get me wrong. I have been on the butt end of an Enterprise CMM\neffort.\n&gt; It&#39;s mucho annoying,\n&gt; however, the underlying goal is still valid and drives toward better\n&gt; software.\n\nIt drives towards more uniform results, certainly; but I don&#39;t know\nabout &quot;better software&quot;.\n--\nJ.
