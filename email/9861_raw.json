Should test scenarios for A or B cover what may \n&gt; &gt; happen in C ? If so, is it just accepted as a code management \n&gt; &gt; overhead to ensure that C is properly tested via tests for A or B ?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Was the class in question designed through the application of \n&gt; TDD?  If so,\n&gt; what is C doing that is extra to what A and B need, and \n&gt; therefore covered by\n&gt; their tests?\n&gt; \n&gt; I hope you can forgive me the extravagance of quoting myself from last\n&gt; month:\n&gt; \n&gt; Test First means that very few of my methods are private, and \n&gt; I really don&#39;t\n&gt; see this as a bad thing.  (Most of the ones that are private \n&gt; are there only\n&gt; because that&#39;s what Eclipses&#39; Extract Method refactoring does).\n&gt; \n&gt; NB:  That is not the same as making private methods public for testing\n&gt; purposes.  That should be avoided at all costs.\n&gt; \n&gt; Regards,\n&gt; Shaun.\n&gt; \n\n---\nOutgoing mail is certified Virus Free.\nChecked by AVG anti-virus system (http://www.grisoft.com).\nVersion: 6.0.533 / Virus Database: 328 - Release Date: 10/31/2003\n \n\n\n",
