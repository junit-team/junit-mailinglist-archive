I&#39;d like to be sure I know\nwhat that is, though.  It sounds like you&#39;d like to use JUnit 4 to run\nJUnit 3 tests, but having the @Ignore annotation observed.  Is this\ntrue?  Are there other features you&#39;d like to be able to use?

Otherwise they are run as JUnit 3 tests.\n&gt;\n&gt;   public static junit.framework.Test suite()\n&gt;   {\n&gt;       return new JUnit4TestAdapter(MyTest.class);\n&gt;   }\n&gt;\n&gt; It would be much work to refactor our old test. I thought it would be\n&gt; easy to use the new JUnit 4 features on them like @Ignore.\n&gt;\n&gt; Why are our tests always run as JUnit 3 tests if they extend from\n&gt; TestCase? Does anyone has a solution for us for using the new JUnit 4\n&gt; features without refactoring our tests very much?\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo! Groups Links\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n",
