We got representatives presenting\nthe product to us and helping us with technical questions. \n\nObviously the unit tests are just a part of Jtest. So comparing Jtest with a\nunit test framework or extension doesn&#39;t seem correct. However, we opted not to\nuse Jtest mostly because of its price (it was around 100,000 Euro (approx.\n$120,000) for the whole company) and partially because we liked open source\nsoftware solution and wanted to give it a chance.\n\nOur comparison was between Jtest on one side and CruiseControl, JUnit,\nCheckStyle, BugFind, PMD, Savant, Clover on the other side. With the exception\nof Clover (a great code coverage tool that we use on the server side) our\ncurrent system consists of the open source products. We didn&#39;t think that Jtest\ngave us anything more that was worth $120,000.\n\nHuman side and discipline are more important than the tools alone...\n\nI strongly advice to make an assessment of what you expect to get from Jtest\ntype solutions, then to take some time to evaluate different systems, highlight\nthe differences and discuss with whoever takes the decisions. If you&#39;re not\nbuying the tool for the right reasons/tasks, it&#39;s going to be added to the\nunused tools lists.\n\n - Yagiz Erkan -\n http://yagiz.blogspot.com\n http://www.erkans.com\n\n\n",
