Units are generally the atomic elements of an application (single classes, for instance), while components may be composed of one or more units. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIntegration testing <br/>\n   Integration tests assess the integration and communication between the components and systems that compose an application.<br/>\n    <br/>\n<br/>\nso as you can see Unit testing is a preface to Integration testing. <br/>\nWhen we test, we execute the functions of an application with the intent of exposing defects. A good test is one that is likely to uncover a flaw that was previously unknown.<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Carlson, Dave&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dave.carlson@...\">dave.carlson@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\nMike,<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is a great question.  I come at the subject from almost the opposite<br/>\ndirection.  I have done a lot of unit testing, but very little integration<br/>\ntesting (integration testing was done by a different group). My thoughts<br/>\nhave been that writing unit tests rather than integration tests allow me to<br/>\ndevelop faster because I do not need to rely on the entire system being up<br/>\nand running before I can test my code.  Also, I never have to wait for<br/>\nanother team to post their fix before moving on.  My tests are local, and<br/>\ntell me if _my_ code is working as intended.<br/>\n<br/>\nI agree that unit testing does not remove the need for integration<br/>\ntesting(they test different things). I would argue that having a full suite<br/>\nof unit tests makes it much more likely the integration tests will pass the<br/>\nfirst time as long as the system design was correct.  Also, bugs found<br/>\nduring unit testing are usually much quicker to find and squash.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--Dave<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Mike Bresnahan [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:java-junit@...\">java-junit@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Friday, June 20, 2003 9:54 AM<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: [junit] Unit Testing vs Integration Testing<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I have experience with integration testing but not much with <br/>\n&gt; unit testing.<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve been reading up on unit testing  (e.g. mock objects, test first<br/>\n&gt; development).  However, I have not found an article that explains the<br/>\n&gt; advantages of unit testing vs integration testing.  My <br/>\n&gt; perhaps naive hunch<br/>\n&gt; is that the cost-per-bug-eliminated of unit testing is higher <br/>\n&gt; than that of<br/>\n&gt; integration testing.  It appears this way because a single <br/>\n&gt; integration test<br/>\n&gt; tests a lot more code than a single unit test and takes about the same<br/>\n&gt; amount of time to construct.  Plus it seems to me that a <br/>\n&gt; whole suite of unit<br/>\n&gt; tests with 100% code coverage cannot guarantee that even the <br/>\n&gt; simplest system<br/>\n&gt; wide behavior is correct (e.g. the web page appears).  Am I <br/>\n&gt; wrong about<br/>\n&gt; this?  Can someone refer me information about this topic.  A <br/>\n&gt; scientific<br/>\n&gt; study paper with real numbers would be welcome.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Mike Bresnahan<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------ Yahoo!
