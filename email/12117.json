A test I&#39;d just written and expected to fail <br/>\ndidn&#39;t.  On 11 Sep 2004 you made a change to TestCase:<br/>\n<br/>\nTestCase.java 1.15<br/>\n&quot;Make sure an exception thrown during tearDown() doesn&#39;t mask an<br/>\nexception thrown during running the test. I don&#39;t much like the <br/>\nTestCase.runBare()<br/>\ncode but I can&#39;t see how to simplify it. It was so much simpler <br/>\nbefore. Sniff...&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile the code now makes sure that if tearDown() throws an exection <br/>\nafter runTest() has thrown one, the exception from the test takes <br/>\npreference.  Unfortunately, if tearDown() DOESN&#39;T throw an exception <br/>\nthe exception from runTest() is completely masked!!  Local <br/>\nvariable &#39;running&#39; needs to be checked at the end of the method to <br/>\nthrow any exception on normal exit!<br/>\n<br/>\nHow can this be I asked?  Surely JUnit&#39;s own unit tests would have a <br/>\ncheck for something as simple as a test not failing when it should?  <br/>\nThen I realised, of course, if it&#39;s using the same version of <br/>\nTestCase, the failure will never be seen!<br/>\n<br/>\nObviously not enough people who are using the CVS version are <br/>\nchecking that their tests fail when they should ;-)!<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers,<br/>\n<br/>\nAndrew</div>",
