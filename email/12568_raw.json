Each test harness should still be able to be run individually\n&gt; &gt;&gt; as it&#39;s own test, but I&#39;m looking to the future as well, when we\n&gt; &gt;&gt; have the potential to do nightly builds and will want to run all of\n&gt; &gt;&gt; the test harnesses as a suite together. This definitely cannot\n&gt; &gt;&gt; happen if any hardcoding exists, but there needs to be some\n&gt; &gt;&gt; external way to pass each object the information specific to it\n&gt; &gt;&gt; only to test. I don&#39;t want to create a properties/configuration\n&gt; &gt;&gt; file for each object, as many of of the objects can re-use the same\n&gt; &gt;&gt; sdf file, logger, and other config files.\n&gt; \n&gt; Mike Clark Thu Dec 30, 2004  9:49 pm\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;d be in a better position to offer advice if I saw example code.\n&gt; \n&gt; True. Meanwhile: how much data gets passed? Could you just use\n&gt; (simple) properties and use, e.g., ant to drive?\n\nHere&#39;s one of the tests for our GetDate module.  The testData object\nwill have various entries, depending on the object being tested. The\ntestData object takes a &quot;key-&gt;value&quot; format and some objects will use\nthe same key name (e.g., &quot;file&quot;) and some are unique to only one\nobject, so I can&#39;t necessarily pass one giant testData that has every\npossible entry, as some objects will try to use every entry in the\ntestData object.  I had thought about properties, but I guess I&#39;m not\nsure how to impliment them on a unit test level as well as then on a\nbuild script.  I want the flexibility of being able to run the unit\ntest individually as well as possibly in a build script as well.  I&#39;m\nfairly new to all of this, as is the company that I&#39;m working for(java\nthat is), so I hope I&#39;m making sense as to what I want.  \n\n    public void testDateTime()\n    {\n        String confFileName = &quot;c:&#92;&#92;nas01&#92;&#92;aev2.conf&quot;;\n        \n        AEv2 aev2 = new AEv2(confFileName);\n        HandyTools.setConfFileName(confFileName);\n        \n        HashMap testData = new HashMap();\n\n        // enter test data here (equivalent of var file entries)\n        int EXPECTED = 0;\n        testData.put(&quot;format&quot;, &quot;mm/dd/yyyy hh:min:ss&quot;);\n\n\t    // initialize module\n\t    GetDate testClass = new GetDate(&quot;&quot;, testData);\n\n\t    // perform action\n\t    int RESULT = testClass.Execute();\n\n\t    // compare results\n\t    Assert.assertTrue( EXPECTED == RESULT );\n\t    java.lang.System.out.println(&quot;Returned Date/Time: [&quot; +\n\t            (String)testData.get(&quot;return&quot;) + &quot;]&quot;);\n\t}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
