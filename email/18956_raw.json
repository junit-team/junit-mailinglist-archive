Another example.. a while ago\n&gt; I was talking to Ivan Moore (of Jester fame) and he was saying that he\n&gt; had an idea for a tool that would go through your Java code and\n&gt; &#39;privitize&#39; it; that is, make all methods private that could be\n&gt; private.  In the spirit of the thing he was thinking of calling it\n&gt; Thatcher :-)  We were talking about it with a few other people who, like\n&gt; me, are very annoyed by the fact that private gets in the way when its\n&gt; in someone else&#39;s mangled code and you don&#39;t have the opportunity to\n&gt; peel it off, and we thought, well, wouldn&#39;t it be nice if your\n&gt; environment just told you which methods weren&#39;t used elsewhere in the\n&gt; system?  Sort of, &quot;this one could be private if you wanted it to be.&quot;\n\nMichael,\n\nVery interesting.  Are you suggesting this tool would allow you to\nmake more things private, or allow you to leave fewer things private,\nwhile still having the documentary benefit from the IDE of an &quot;only\nused locally&quot; marker?\n\nThanks,\n\n   David Saff\n\n",
