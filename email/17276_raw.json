Best JUnit tester is the senior software developer. But senior  \nguys hate\nto write test cases.\n\nSenior guys who hate writing tests are not senior guys.  Writing  \ntests is a matter of professional ethics.  The only way to truly know  \nthat the code you have written works, and works in the whole system,  \nis to have, and run, a comprehensive set of tests.  Code coverage for  \nthese tests should be very close to 100% (i.e. high 90s).  If you  \ndon&#39;t have this, then you don&#39;t KNOW that your code actually works.   \nAnd shipping code that you aren&#39;t as certain as possible about is  \nunprofessional.\n\nI wear a green band on my wrist that says &quot;Test First&quot;.  (http:// \nbutunclebob.com/ArticleS.UncleBob.GreenWristBand)\nIt is a symbol of my commitment to produce the best code I can, and  \nto be sure that it works to the best of my ability.  It reminds me to  \nwrite tests, to write them first, and to write them diligently.\n\nThe argument about &quot;TIME&quot; is laughable.  It is like saying that we  \ndon&#39;t have time to test, but we DO have time to debug.  That&#39;s an  \nunprofessional attitude.  Time spent writing tests is time that will  \nprevent us from having to debug.  Time spent writing tests is time  \nspent designing, is time spent thinking, and is time spent making  \nsure that our code can be checked again, and again, and again.\n\nAnyone who says that they don&#39;t have time to write tests should not  \nbe writing code.\n                 |\n\n----\nRobert C.
