On the topic at hand, I know that Vladimir Bossicard has\n&gt; implemented a\n&gt; &gt; scheme that will let you register services with the junit\n&gt; architecture for\n&gt; &gt; letting you extend it easily for custom reporting and what-not.\n&gt; I don&#39;t know\n&gt; &gt; the current status of that effort though so perhaps he can comment?\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; He can comment, he can :-)\n&gt;\n&gt; My project (www.bossicard.com/projects/junit.php) is the result of all\n&gt; the experiments I made on JUnit over the last nine months.  I choose\n&gt; this way not to replace JUnit but to see how users&#39; requests could be\n&gt; implemented in JUnit (the official version).  I agree I coded a little\n&gt; bit too much and my version does not look like JUnit anymore :-)\n&gt; Because this project is a prototype and not a replacement to the\n&gt; official version, I am not putting too much effort in it anymore and\n&gt; wait to see the direction Erich and Kent take with their framework.\n&gt;\n&gt; I am also working on another project with the idea to have more\n&gt; flexibility while running your tests (defining services accessible by\n&gt; all tests (single db connection, CORBA service, logging mechanism...),\n&gt; replacing the different property and allTests.java files with XML files,\n&gt; writing the output in an XML file and then converting it into HTML, text\n&gt; file..., providing metrics for every test (and not only the failed\n&gt; one),... ).  For those interested: www.bossicard.com/apricot, I&#39;ll\n&gt; release some code in the new few days.\n&gt;\n&gt; -Vladimir\n&gt;\n&gt; --\n&gt; Vladimir Bossicard\n&gt; www.bossicard.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
