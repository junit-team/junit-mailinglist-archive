Generally, this is a big=\r\n no-no in unit\n&gt;&gt; testing, and I&#39;d like  to understand why you think you ne=\r\ned to do it.\n&gt; \n&gt; I do a lookup and use those managers to initialise some\n&gt;=\r\n objects.  And I do not want to lookup managers again and\n&gt; again to initia=\r\nlize these objects everytime for use.  As long\n&gt; as behavior of these looku=\r\nps and initialization doesn&#39;t\n&gt; change over different Unit tests I do not s=\r\nee why it should be a\n&gt; no-no.. \n\nI still don&#39;t understand why you&#39;d have m=\r\nore than one test class be\ndependent on those lookups at all. Sounds like a=\r\n kind of coupling I wouldn&#39;t\nwant to have.\n\nIf you aren&#39;t worried about it,=\r\n you can initiliaze those objects once using\na TestSetup decorator, though.=\r\n And again, take a look at the Object Mother\npattern.\n\n&gt;&gt;  Let me clarify: =\r\nI certainly encountered code that was hard to test\n&gt;&gt; using  Junit. My solu=\r\ntion until now always was to improve the code,\n&gt;&gt; not to extend  Junit, tho=\r\nugh. And I wholeheartedly think it was the\n&gt;&gt; better solution.\n&gt; \n&gt; We can =\r\ndebate this forever.   To what extent we should support\n&gt; testability..? I =\r\nhope you concur we should stop at some level.\n\nI&#39;m not interested in a deba=\r\nte. I&#39;m interested in discussion, though, in\nlearning about the experiences=\r\n of others, and in providing my experience to\nthose who are interested in i=\r\nt.\n\nIf nothing else, my reasoning might explain to you why Junit is the way=\r\n it\nis, why it doesn&#39;t out of the box support the type of testing you are\nr=\r\nequesting, which you seemed to be curious about. If you really think you\nne=\r\ned to do that kind of testing and are not interested in discussing\nalternat=\r\nives, that&#39;s fine with me. In my experience Junit is flexible enough\nto pro=\r\nvide that kind of testing, too, as an extension.\n\nAnd to provide an answer =\r\nto your very first question in this thread: the\npain you are experiencing s=\r\neems to mainly come from the fact that you want\nto use Junit differently fr=\r\nom how most of its other users use and advocate\nit.\n\nTake care, Ilja\n\n\n",
