Clearly, I need a test suite. The need for refactoring is\n&gt; made obvious by the fact that fixing some bugs tends to generate\n&gt; others, so an even more important reason to create the test suite is\n&gt; to make sure that I have thought through the desired behaviors and\n&gt; have verified that they will occur.\n\nI&#39;ve been there.\n\nUnfortunately, in many cases these applications are written in a way\nthat make them extremely difficult to unit test. Especially if the\ndesign is not very modular, it can be nearly impossible to get any\nreasonable unit test coverage without modifying the application to make\nit more modular. In such cases, if you can, it might be worth writing\nan automated functional test suite first, getting as much coverage\nfrom that as you can, so that you can use that to help verify that\nyour changes are not breaking the system behaviour that is currently\nworking. But often you just have to live with the pain of breaking\nuntested things as you modify the application. That&#39;s unfortunate, but\nsince you break the application anyway every time you touch it, if the\ncurrent situation calls for continuing modifications in the future\nyou&#39;re going to be breaking it anyway. You might as well be using the\nneed for changes to try and bring the application into a more testable\nstate.\n\nThe key here, I&#39;ve found, is just clean up the bits you are directly\ntouching as you add features and fix bugs. Keep the changes to other\nparts of the system as minimal as possible, and don&#39;t go changing\nsomething just for the sake of adding testing to it. If a particular\npiece of code really is broken, you&#39;ll have a bug report and thus a\nreason to go changing it.\n\ncjs\n-- \nCurt Sampson  &lt;cjs@...&gt;   +81 90 7737 2974   http://www.netbsd.org\n    Don&#39;t you know, in this new Dark Age, we&#39;re all light.  --XTC\n\n\n",
