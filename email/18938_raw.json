So it is not so easy to have a look at a=\r\nt one code unit at a time.\n \nSo it could easily be the case that writing th=\r\ne tests afterwards will take a lot more time because you have to refactor y=\r\nour whole code before you can even start to implement the actual tests. Or =\r\nto put it the other way round: TDD makes you write more modular, easier to =\r\nread and maintain code.\n \nBest regards,\nMatt\n\n_____________________________=\r\n___\n\nFrom: junit@yahoogroups.com [mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com] On Behalf O=\r\nf C=A8=A6dric Beust ? \nSent: Friday, February 16, 2007 5:48 PM\nTo: junit@ya=\r\nhoogroups.com\nSubject: Re: [junit] additional expenses\n\n\n\nHi Felix,\n\nThis i=\r\ns an interesting question, and I don&#39;t think it&#39;s been brought up here\nbefo=\r\nre.\n\nIn my experience, this is a bit hard to quantify, but it&#39;s probably fa=\r\nir to\nsay that while the cost appears a bit on the high side initially (esp=\r\necially\nif the developers on your team are not used to writing tests and th=\r\nat there\nis no existing testing infrastructure), it tends to decrease over =\r\ntime as\nprogrammers become more experienced in writing tests, reuse or crea=\r\nte test\nbase classes and tend to write solid tests in their first iteration=\r\n.\n\nAlthough it&#39;s obviously hard to prove or disprove, I would probably say =\r\nthat\nat the very beginning, it&#39;s not rare to spend as much time writing a t=\r\nest as\nit is to implement the corresponding feature. That first test is alw=\r\nays\nvery expensive, especially if it&#39;s an area of your product that has no =\r\ntests\nat all. It all gets better after that.\n\nHope it helps, and looking fo=\r\nrward to other people&#39;s answers.\n\n-- \nC=F0gic\nhttp://testng.org &lt;http://tes=\r\ntng.org&gt; \n\nOn 2/16/07, felix3142 &lt;f.noz@... &lt;mailto:f.noz%40comund=\r\nus.com&gt; &gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hello,\n&gt;\n&gt; we&#39;re going to establish unit-testing (basi=\r\ncally for web applications)\n&gt; in our company. Because we don&#39;t want to chan=\r\nge the whole programming\n&gt; paradigm to XP we rather want to use a test-last=\r\n method in the\n&gt; beginning and then watch out for further steps.\n&gt; I&#39;m now =\r\nin the process of investigating the basic requirements and\n&gt; conditions.\n&gt; =\r\nOne question that occured is if it&#39;s possible to quantify the amount\n&gt; of e=\r\nxtra time you need when using unit testing compared to the\n&gt; non-testing ap=\r\nproach. I solely refer to the writing of unit tests.\n&gt; Later saving of time=\r\n (by better code) shouldn&#39;t be considered. So\n&gt; what&#39;s your experience? Can=\r\n anybody do a statement about time\n&gt; consumption of writing unit tests?\n&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n Regards\n&gt; Felix\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt;\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been remov=\r\ned]\n\n\n\n \n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n",
