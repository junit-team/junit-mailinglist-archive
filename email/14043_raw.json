Ron is author of\nExtreme Programming Adventures in C#, the senior author of Extreme Programming\nInstalled, and was the on-site XP coach for the original Extreme Programming\nproject. He&#39;ll be presenting a talk entitled &quot;Why Software Development Is\nEasy,&quot; unless he can&#39;t figure out by the meeting why it is, in which case the\nadjective may be changed.\n\nWe are pleased and honored to have Ron! This is a great opportunity to meet one\nof pioneers of agile software development. For those who have never attended a\nColorado Springs Agile event, it&#39;s also a good first exposure to what agile is\nall about.\n\nRon has been involved with Extreme Programming since 1996, presenting numerous\ntalks and publishing papers on the topic. He is the proprietor of\nXProgramming.com, a well-known source of XP and agile information. Ron is an\nindependent consultant with Object Mentor. He is a featured instructor for\ntheir popular XP Immersion course, which he helped create.\n\nRon has advanced degrees in mathematics and computer science, and has been a\nsystems developer for more years than most of you have been alive. His teams\nhave built operating systems, compilers, relational database systems, and a\nlarge range of applications. Ron&#39;s software products have produced revenue of\nover half a billion dollars, and he wonders why he didn&#39;t get any of it.\n\nDETAILS\n\nThe meeting is at Colorado Springs Fire Station #14 (capacity: 68), 1875 Dublin\nBlvd--behind The Oak Place at Dublin and Academy. The meeting is free and open\nto software professionals and students. Please share this announcement with\nyour colleagues.
