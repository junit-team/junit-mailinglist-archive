Also, <br/>\n&gt; sometimes the build system or political structure of a team can <br/>\n&gt; make it easier to edit XML files than Java, in which case the <br/>\n&gt; ant file might make sense.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Some details on the environment:<br/>\n<br/>\n* Rather small project and team (3-4 active developers, <br/>\nincluding myself), <br/>\n* Rather vanilla J2EE web application (Struts-based web gui and <br/>\nHibernate+RDBMS backend)<br/>\n* Rather mature development stage<br/>\n* All main activities (development, deployment and testing) are <br/>\nperformed entirely with the IDE (Eclipse)<br/>\n* Currently lacking an automated testing/build environment (i.e. <br/>\neverything is done manually)<br/>\n<br/>\ncould these be of any help in making a decision (or in finding a <br/>\ntradeoff)...?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks<br/>\nEmmanuele</div>",
