Unit tests often test the interplay of two or\n&gt; three\n&gt; &gt; methods, or even of several objects. You can&#39;t do this \n&gt; (effectively) \n&gt; &gt; with embedded assertions.\n&gt; \n&gt; If you use Design by Contract then the implementation can be checked \n&gt; by the compiler to be valid or not.\n\nAre you sure? Can you show me an example of such a compiler message,\nplease?\n\n&gt; &gt; Do you have a pointer?\n&gt; I don&#39;t know what you mean.\n\nI meant something like a web-link. In the meantime I found the\nJML-homepage, but the documentation is rather unorganized. Where does it\nstate that the checks are done at compile time?\n\n&gt; &gt; That&#39;s wrong, as others already stated.\n&gt; \n&gt; But how will you test a method which returns nothing?\n\nBy testing for the side effect.\n\nCan you give an example of a method you think of as untestable by Junit?\n\n&gt; &gt; Asserts are even less a guarantee. Asserts need to be \n&gt; executed to be \n&gt; &gt; effective - if you don&#39;t have external code invoking them in a well \n&gt; &gt; directed manner, they will not be of any use until in the \n&gt; production \n&gt; &gt; environment.\n&gt; \n&gt; In my following posting I favor Design by Contract instead of just \n&gt; using\n&gt; assert statements. I replied to myself. Read the thread when it \n&gt; appears.\n\nThe same argument applies to DBC.\n\n&gt; &gt; If you really prefer this way, it wouldn&#39;t be too hard to include\n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; unit tests into your production code. Most people seem to prefer to \n&gt; &gt; seperate the two.\n&gt; \n&gt; I prefer Design by Contract. Most people don&#39;t know that paradigma.\n\nMany TDDers do know.\n\n&gt; &gt; Junit doesn&#39;t force you to develop test-driven at all.\n&gt; \n&gt; It suggests it strongy I think. Otherwise the synchronisation of code \n&gt; and test is endangered.\n\nI don&#39;t follow you. All you need to do is run the tests regularly, so it\nseems to me.\n\n&gt; &gt; You might fear that it is. In practice, it doesn&#39;t seem to be that\n&gt; way.\n&gt; \n&gt; If you use TDD in its intended form than you lose time. Thats my \n&gt; opinion.\n\nOK.\n\n&gt; &gt; minutes. There are even tools to automate this. My IDE shows me \n&gt; wether I\n&gt; &gt; run the tests since the last code change, and an integration server\n&gt; &gt; emails me if I broke a test nevertheless.\n&gt; \n&gt; Still much work. I prefer to concentrate on code and not on test \n&gt; quality.\n\nFor me, test quality has a huge impact on code quality. YMMV.\n\nI also wonder what the big difference is between maintaining tests and\nmaintaining DBC-like contracts.\n\nRegards, Ilja\n\n\n",
