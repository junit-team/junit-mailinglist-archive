I&#39;ve a unit test case\nwhich makes sure my functionality is wo=\r\nrking as per expected behavior. \n\nThe method I followed here is simple, I&#39;v=\r\ne tried injecting the mock\nobjects into my code so that my functionality us=\r\nes the mock objects\ninstead of actual &#39;Real Time&#39; Connection object. \n\nBut =\r\nafter I finished the whole functionality, I realized that it\ndidn&#39;t work wi=\r\nth a &#39;Real Time&#39; Connection object. I figured out the\nreason is that I neve=\r\nr worried about the &#39;Real&#39; connection object when\nI was unit testing my cod=\r\ne. \n\nMy question is.. \n\n1) Whose responsibility is to initialize this &#39;Real=\r\n&#39; object in my class ? \n2) Should my unit tests cover this &#39;Initializing re=\r\nal time objects&#39; as\nwell ? \n3) What way I can assure that my &#39;Real&#39; objects=\r\n are initialized\nproperly ? \n\nI&#39;m totally stuck here. Any suggestion would =\r\nbe of great help to me.. \n\nThanks in advance.  \n\nSarat\n\n\n",
