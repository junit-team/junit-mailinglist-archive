And in my experience, that&#39;s very\n&gt; &gt;&gt; likely always possible, in a way that makes the design more\n&gt; &gt;&gt; flexible and the behaviour more reusable. \n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; Does that sound reasonable?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 1. Are you doing this /just/ so that you can test the method\n&gt; &gt; by external invocation? If so then my answer is no. 2. Is the\n&gt; &gt; method already tested through the public API of the class? If\n&gt; &gt; yes then my answer is no. 3. Does the system (code plus\n&gt; &gt; tests) clearly communicate everything that needs to be\n&gt; &gt; communicated at this time? If it does then my answer is no.\n&gt; &gt; 4. Is the flexibility and reusability that you refer to\n&gt; &gt; needed now or is it speculative? If the latter then my answer\n&gt; &gt; is no. 5. Was my answer no to the previous questions and\n&gt; &gt; there are more stories needing to be implemented this iteration?\n&gt; &gt; Then heck no! \n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m not doing this &quot;just&quot; for one thing. In my experience moving a\n&gt; complex method to a place where it wants to be public both\n&gt; \n&gt; - makes the code more expressive,\n&gt; - makes the code easier to test,\n&gt; - makes the code more flexible, and thereby\n&gt; - helps me to maintain a high velocity.\n&gt; \n&gt; Also keep in mind that moving the method often is only a first step,\n&gt; an enabler for further simplifying refactorings.\n&gt; \n\nHmm. Sounds like you have your &quot;Designer&quot; hat on. That wasn&#39;t what I\nunderstood to be the context of the question. &quot;How do I test a private\nmethod&quot; is a question someone wearing their &quot;Tester&quot; hat would ask.\nGiven that context, my mind hasn&#39;t changed. If the private method is\nalready tested through an existing public method then you don&#39;t need\nto do anything. In fact, exposing the method and writing an explicit\ntest against it is duplication.\n\nDoes that mean I believe Extract Class and Move Method are never used.\nOf course not! But I don&#39;t think they provide a solution, per se, to\n&quot;How do I test a private method&quot; unless the context includes &quot;This\nwasn&#39;t developed TDD and I don&#39;t have any confidence in it.&quot;\n\nMaybe I&#39;m wrong about this, but I tend to view each of the\nrefactorings as a mini-pattern: a solution to a problem in a context.\nEach refactoring describes a motivation which includes the context.\nFor example, the motivation for Extract Class as described in\n/Refactoring/ is that the class has too many responsibilities and has\nlost cohesion. I don&#39;t see anything there about using the refactoring\nto expose private methods of the class for testing. Likewise, the\nmotivation for Move Method doesn&#39;t include not being able to test a\nmethod because of access restrictions. \n\nMaybe Martin Fowler wasn&#39;t wearing his Tester hat at the time. Maybe\nhe was and wanted to write a book about how to produce better designs,\nnot about solving problems with unit tests. So, third maybe in a row,\nmaybe refactorings shouldn&#39;t be viewed as ways to solve problems with\nyour the test suite? Or, maybe it would be an interesting topic to\nwrite an article on -- how to apply refactorings when your focus is\ntesting and not design.\n\nRegards,\nJim\n\n\n\n\n\n",
