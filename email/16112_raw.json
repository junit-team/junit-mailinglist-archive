EMMA does everything we&#39;ve\n&gt; &gt; needed so far, and so I don&#39;t feel any design to\n&gt; change.\n&gt; &gt; But there are definitely other good coverage tools\n&gt; out\n&gt; &gt; there, too.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The cost of implementation is very low, as is the\n&gt; cost\n&gt; &gt; of switching.  So why not go with EMMA for now and\n&gt; if\n&gt; &gt; you find it doesn&#39;t do something you need, switch\n&gt; it\n&gt; &gt; out later?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Todd.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nTired of spam?
