B. Rainsberger &lt;jbrains762@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; So I&#39;d like a way to separate my design and testing activities when I do\n&gt; TDD. For example, when I test-drive behavior that doesn&#39;t yet exist, I&#39;m\n&gt; almost always designing; but when I fill in the holes by adding a test\n&gt; for a case that should already pass, I&#39;m testing. Perhaps it would be\n&gt; better to separate those somehow.\n&gt;\n&gt; Any ideas?\n&gt;\n\nA couple of years ago, I prototyped something (I called it Test by Example)\nwhich you would point at a newly written class and it would construct\ninstances\nand show you what happens when you call its methods with various inputs. It\nwas a tool to help you figure out the behavior of an object and identify any\nunexpected behaviors. It was very useful for the kind of post-TDD testing\nthat you talk about but useless for huge legacy projects with lots of\ninter-dependencies.\n\nI am often struck by the distance between the discussions in lists like this\none and mainstream practice out there in Cubeland.\n\nPeople such as ourselves (by which I mean people who talk about testing\nideas on mailing lists) are able to mentally partition the various goals of\ntesting and identify gaps and opportunities for improvement. We tend towards\na big bag o&#39; testing tricks that we can delve into and choose the right\ntrick for the right goal and are always on the lookout for new tricks to add\nto the bag. I suspect that mainstream development teams still have a single\nbucket in their budget marked &#39;testing&#39; and they are looking a for a\none-shot solution that will solve all their testing needs.\n\nSelfishly, I&#39;d use a tool like the one I described but I&#39;d like to see more\ntools that can gently ease developers into a test-infected frame of mind so\nthey can benefit from some of the other great ideas that will surely be\ndiscussed here.\n\n-- \nKevin\n\nhttp://www.junitfactory.com\nYou send us code. We send you tests. For free.\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n",
