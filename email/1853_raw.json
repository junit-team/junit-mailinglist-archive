It&#39;s likely that any problems you encounter will have already\nbeen encountered (and solved) by other people and the answers will be in\nthese archives. That&#39;s certainly been my experience.\n\nWe also started using JUnit recently, but I didn&#39;t have to do much in the\nway of formal documentation to convince management to support it. It was\nmore a matter of &quot;hey, look at this really neat way of doing automated unit\ntesting. Once we had a decent set of automated unit tests, there was no\nturning back.\n\nHope this is of some help,\nPeter\n\n",
