In a nutshell, when a plugin, which\nis loaded by its own classloader, is being\ninstantiated, it is possible another thread from\nanother plugin that depends on it is ALSO trying to\naccess it. The very first time any class within the\nclasspath of a plugin is asked for by the JVM, the\nplugin lifecycle class is created first.\n\nSo I want a way to try to simulate several threads\naccessing the same one plugin, and some way to &quot;test&quot;\nthat the first thread to access it &quot;locks&quot; the plugin\nduring creation and the other threads wait (we have\nsynchronized the block of code that creates the\nplugin) until the creation is done. THEN, they should\nnot be able to cause the plugin they are acessing to\nbe created again, because it&#39;s state now indicates its\nalready created.\n\nWithout diving any further into the engine, feel free\nto check out the source. Is there any way to test\nthis? I am thinking in the constructor of the plugin\nbeing accessed by many threads, put a sleep call to\n&quot;delay&quot; how fast the plugin is created, so that the\nother threads have time to try to access it.\n\nThanks.\n\n\n\n\t\t\n__________________________________ \nDo you Yahoo!? \nYahoo!
