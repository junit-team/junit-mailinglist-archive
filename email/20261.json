I will be happy to post and share the results<br/>\nwith anyone and if it is okay I will also post it on this forum.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere is the link to the survey. It should only take you 5 minutes.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.surveymonkey.com/s.aspx?sm=zfbx0YhilnOVMwXpSjTWYw_3d_3d\">https://www.surveymonkey.com/s.aspx?sm=zfbx0YhilnOVMwXpSjTWYw_3d_3d</a><br/>\n<br/>\nThanks in advance for any participation!</div>",
