    "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1051856703\">i have been assigned the task of pushing our development team toward <br/>\nunit testing.  i have been working with junit for a few weeks now but <br/>\ncontinue to struggle with one issue.  it seems to me there is tension <br/>\nbetween unit testing and my preferred api.  for a given class i would <br/>\nlike to expose only a handful of methods, yet do not want to forfeit <br/>\ntesting my private methods.  my feeling is that i should be concerned <br/>\nwith continually testing those methods, and yet fail to see why i <br/>\nshould expose methods which are meaningless outside the &quot;blackbox&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nperhaps i am missing something obvious about good design.  in the <br/>\nmean time i have set up a simple interface which classes i test <br/>\ninternally must implement.<br/>\n<br/>\npublic interface Testable<br/>\n{<br/>\n\tpublic static final boolean INTERNAL_MODE = true;<br/>\n\t<br/>\n\tpublic void runInternalTests() throws Exception;<br/>\n}<br/>\n<br/>\nthis allows me to run internal tests and handle assertions by calling <br/>\nthe static methods of Assert.  INTERNAL_MODE must be checked within <br/>\nrunInternalTests().  This allows internal testing to be turned off <br/>\nfor production builds.<br/>\n<br/>\nany insight about this dilemna would be appreciated.</div>",
