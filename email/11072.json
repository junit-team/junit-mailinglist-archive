I&#39;ve submitted one patch<br/>\nfor the enabled/disabled attribute on buttons and that patch is now<br/>\nin the repository ready for the next release.  I am working with a<br/>\ngroup of tech leads to improve (or basically create) the support for<br/>\nhtml table objects (and sub-elements/attributes/etc...) within the<br/>\nJavaScript support of httpUnit.  We already have basic row and cell<br/>\naddressing working in the JavaScript support (all tested of course).<br/>\n<br/>\nI have offered help in this area several times on the httpunit mail<br/>\nlist but haven&#39;t received a lot of enthusiasm.  So now that we are <br/>\nrunning into some issues, we are going to fix them and submit patches.<br/>\n<br/>\nMike Corum<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;Message: 5<br/>\n&gt;   Date: Wed, 26 May 2004 12:07:28 +0530<br/>\n&gt;   From: Ranjeet Sahay &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:rsahay@...\">rsahay@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Subject: Re: HTTP Unit vs HTML Unit<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Beware of  support for JavaScripts.<br/>\n&gt;HTTPUnit are not very good, so I had to abandon and use other tools </span></blockquote></div>",
