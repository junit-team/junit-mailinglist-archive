It is definitely JUnit 3.8 test extension, so\never=\r\ny time you make a class, you could forget to setup the setup\nmethod or the =\r\nteardown method (that last one is a bigger deal, as\noften the tests have no=\r\n reason to recreate their own teardown, but\nteardown puts the database back=\r\n into a production state\n(re-instituting the audit trail and other trigger-=\r\nbased operations,\nfor example). So in other words it would be an ongoing ov=\r\nerhead every\ntime a new DBUnit test is made.\n\nOn the other hand, if the tes=\r\nter did make their DBUnit test class a\nJUnit 4 class, it would work with th=\r\nis hack.\n\nThere are techniques for using DBUnit without subclassing its cla=\r\nss\nand kind of forcing testers to use JUnit4, but there is a lot of\ncommon =\r\nsetup code that seems to be good in the setup method. In fact,\nit seems a s=\r\nmall step backwards that there is no way to inherit setup\nand teardown from=\r\n a superclass (or some other method, say an\nannotation that runs the before=\r\n and after declared in another class)\n\n--- In junit@yahoogroups.com, Mark L=\r\nevison &lt;mark@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Do you ever intend to change styles? If you do=\r\n then you have pay the\nprice\n&gt; of the transition eventually. I had a simili=\r\nar class of problem\n&gt; transitioning from NUnit 1.??? to 2.0 on a .NET proje=\r\nct a few years\nago. In\n&gt; the end two of us divvied up the test code base an=\r\nd tore it too\npieces with\n&gt; scripts and chainsaws over two days. We reviewe=\r\nd each others work\nand got it\n&gt; right without too too much trouble.\n&gt; \n&gt; As=\r\n for JUnit 4.x vs 3.8 - I&#39;ve never had the problems you outlined\nperhaps\n&gt; =\r\nwe should all dig deeper.\n&gt; \n&gt; Back to my paying client.

I expect it to break with JUnit 4.6.\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; 2) Intellij doesn&#39;t report the test name correctly.

Clearly they do for JUnit 4 tests, but I\n&gt; &gt; haven&#39;t found anyt=\r\nhing for intermixing JUnit 3 tests.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I do appreciate the insight abo=\r\nut the Assume class, it is very helpful\n&gt; &gt; to know!\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; --- In junit@y=\r\nahoogroups.com &lt;junit%40yahoogroups.com&gt;, Mark Levison\n&gt; &gt; &lt;mark@&gt; wrote:\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; On Tue, Feb 17, 2009 at 1:23 PM, yme0987654321 &lt;yme0987654321@&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hi David,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; My name is Yishai (I have =\r\nto figure out how to change this Yahoo\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; profile).
