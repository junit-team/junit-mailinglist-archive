    "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-323550444\">More companies are using autoresponders based on Noise Dispersal Parsers<br/>\nthese days. They throw away everything in the message they don&#39;t<br/>\nunderstand, do a convoluted response table lookup, and send a canned email<br/>\nback. Yahoo may be using something like that. There are several companies<br/>\nthat sell such software. It seems to emulate the behavior of an underpaid<br/>\nand underqualified tech reasonably well.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Wed, 2 Jan 2002, Erik Hanson wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; &quot;Philippe Vanpeperstraete&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:philippe.vanpeperstraete@...\">philippe.vanpeperstraete@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; This is the reaction I received from Yahoo about the spamming sent to our<br/>\n&gt; &gt; list recently. Any reactions?

I run the xp-jobs group. It got hit hard with spam (not<br/>\n&gt; too long after Windows XP came out... hmm...). The xp-jobs list has one or two<br/>\n&gt; posts a month, so having a few spams a day means a horrible signal-to-noise<br/>\n&gt; ratio.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I restricted posting to members only, but that didn&#39;t help. So now what I do<br/>\n&gt; is manually approve new members only if they reply correctly to the welcome<br/>\n&gt; message that gets sent when they try to sign up. There is no more spam, but it<br/>\n&gt; requires a couple minutes a day of manual work.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Erik<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\">junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
