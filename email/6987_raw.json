In our organisation\ntesting is evolving. Additionally there is a common\nproblem of Devlopment Vs Testing arguments. In any\nregression round if a new bug comes in then the issue\nraised will be why this bug was not identified in\nprevious round though it will be fixed later. We\nthought over and looked into the possibility of\nchecking effectiveness of testing. As the process is\nstill evolving Testing gets less amount of inputs ...\nin all sense - time, resource, documents, functional\ntraining... ! \n\nMy question is, in such constraints how one can\nmeasure and control the effectiveness of Testing? \nThis is typically for Manual Testing. The issue of\nAutomated Testing remains apart ... :)\n\nRegards, Manish\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nMissed your favourite TV serial last night?
