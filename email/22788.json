This isn&#39;t documented in any of the guides I found in the articles section of the JUnit site.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, this may just be me whining, but... Yahoo Groups seems like a poor place for a project like this. I had to register a Yahoo account to join the group, which wouldn&#39;t normally bother me, except that Yahoo forces me to use their mail system to get updates (apparently I have to pay to get the option to forward my mail elsewhere). Sourceforge gives you the option to get a real mailing list that requires no website account at all.<br/>\nAgain, I may just be a lazy whiner, but I found it frustrating.</div>",
