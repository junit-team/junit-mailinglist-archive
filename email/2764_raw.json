In some of my code,\nI reference classes in org.w3c.dom and org.apache.crimson. Now, as soon as\njunit came across classes from these packages, it threw class not found\nexceptions. Please note that this doesn&#39;t happen in the the textui nor my\nown testing classes, since they are both in the classpath.\n\norg.w3c.dom specifically is in the rt.jar\norg.apache.crimson is a separate jar, which is on my classpath\n\nAfter a bit of digging around in the source code, specifically in the\nTestCaseClassLoader, I found out about the junit&#92;runner&#92;exclude.properties\nfile. When I added these package names to that file, things seemed ok, and\nthose exceptions didn&#39;t take place.\n\nWhat confused me was why it didn&#39;t find the classes, even though they was on\nmy classpath, especially the org.w3c ones which are in the rt.jar (with\n1.4). Furthermore, this was only a problem when using the swingui, with the\ntextui, it was fine.\n\nI&#39;ve got it working now that I put those details in the exclude.properties\nfile. Is this perhaps a issue with using 1.4?\n\nAny comments or explainations?\nThanks\nAnthony\n\r\n------_=_NextPart_000_01C146D1.3AB53D70\r\nContent-Type: application/ms-tnef\r\n\r\n[ Attachment content not displayed ]\r\n------_=_NextPart_000_01C146D1.3AB53D70--\r\n\n",
