JUnit is totally new for me. My client requested me to \nupdate the JUnit in the system to version 3.8.1. \n\nc:/work/xp/lib/ is the directory which stores the junit.jar.\nI replace the junit.jar with the newest version of junit.jar I just  \ndownloaded recently and \nbuild clean refreshdb deploy are all successful. Only build test is \ngiving me problem. It seems like all test files cannot be tested at \nall. All tests are failed.\n[Junitreport] stated that *alltestfile*.xml is not a valid XML \ndocument, it is possibly corrupted.\n\nMy client told me that JUnit has changed significantly. \nDo I need to modify anything in build.xml? \nIs it only replacing the newest junit.jar but no others?\nWhere can I find a site that shows me the way to update JUnit from \nolder version to newest version3.8.1? (I am not sure which version I \nam currently using but I think it is only a bit older that \n3.8.1,Sorry!) \n\nMay be I have missed out something in converting the version. I am \nnot sure. Can anyone out there please teach me about this issue. \nYour advises and answers are really appreciated.\n\nThank you so much!\n\nBest Regards,\nwenyew\n\n\n\n",
