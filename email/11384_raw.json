If that \nfails, then all your database dependant tests fail, you know that \nthe connection could not be established due to the DB connection \ntest.  The fact that the other tests fail as a side effect is \nsomewhat irrelevant.\n\nThe other suggestion I saw about doing asserts in setup could be \nused, too.  Or, something I currently do (an idea blatantly stolen \nfrom my co-workers), if testing some pre-existing condition is to \nsimply notate:\n\nassertEquals(&quot;Test setup: This should be zero initially&quot;, 0, \nsomeClass.Value());\n\nThen if a &#39;test setup&#39; assert is thrown, you know that there was \nsomething wrong before you even made it to the asserts you were \nreally testing.  Very useful, simple, and doesn&#39;t require some grand \nmechanism.\n\n-Eric\n\n--- In junit@yahoogroups.com, Andrew Forward &lt;aforward@g...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Yes.\n&gt; \n&gt; But all database tests will fail, without any one test pin-pointing\n&gt; the why.  I would prefer to see one problem (in this case invalid\n&gt; database connection) be isolated by one failing test (additional \ntests\n&gt; may fail - but more because of the side effect of this one test).\n&gt; \n\n\n\n",
