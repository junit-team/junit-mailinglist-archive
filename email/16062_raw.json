B. Rainsberger changed the world a bit at a time by saying (astral da=\r\nte: 2/10/2006 4:49 AM) :#\n&gt; C=C3=A9dric Beust =E2=99=94 wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt;&gt;    - U=\r\nsing debuggers less might be a good thing *if* the developers find\n&gt;&gt;    bu=\r\ngs faster.  I have seen quite a few TDD enthusiasts choose not to use\n&gt;&gt;   =\r\n debuggers for dogmatic reasons (&quot;because I read it in a book&quot;) and then\n&gt;&gt;=\r\n    spend hours writing tests or even println&#39;s trying to reproduce a \n&gt;&gt; m=\r\nysterious\n&gt;&gt;    bug that a breakpoint would have caught in a few minutes.\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; While I agree with your overall point, I&#39;m surprised by this. If a \n&gt; d=\r\nebugger could have found the problem in a few minutes, then why did it \n&gt; t=\r\nake hours to write the tests? If I have to write 1 test per frame of \n&gt; the=\r\n stack trace, that&#39;s maybe 15-20 tests.\n&gt; \n&gt; Now, if it takes hours to writ=\r\ne 20 tests, then they must not be very \n&gt; good TDD practitioners; and if th=\r\ney&#39;re good TDD practitioners, then the \n&gt; code is easy to test and it would=\r\nn&#39;t take hours to write 20 of them.\n&gt; \n&gt; My general approach is this:\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\n1. Reason about the problem. Try to write 2-3 tests.\n&gt; 2. If #1 doesn&#39;t fin=\r\nd the problem, launch the debugger and step until we \n&gt; find the frame of t=\r\nhe stack where the problem occurs.\n&gt; 3. Find the values of the input to tha=\r\nt method, then drop out of the \n&gt; debugger and write the test. It fails.\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; Voila. As you say, a /good/ marriage between debugger and tests.\n\nI tend=\r\n to agree with the this approach, but I use it quite in the other order:\n- =\r\nreason about the problem; set some breakpoints; fire debugger; find the sta=\r\nck where the problem occurs\n- write the test =3D&gt; fails\n- fix the code =3D&gt;=\r\n test passes\n\nI have tried both approaches, and for me (I underline this) i=\r\nt worked better.\n\n./alex\n--\n.w( the_mindstorm )p.\n\n\n\n",
