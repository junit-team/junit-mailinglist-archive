Binder (explaining to his \ndaughter why his book (more than 1,000 pages) was so big)\n\n&quot;Testing is complicated and I&#39;m an engineer. Making sure tht things work \nright if very important for engineers. [...] So when engineers build \nsomething or answer a question about how to build things, we have to be \nsure we&#39;re right. We have to be sure nothing is left out. It takes a lot \nof work.&quot;\n\n\n&gt; 2) what junit is doing? it compares the expected with\n&gt; actual but this can be done manualy\n\n\nthe goal of automated testing is to remove the &quot;manually&quot; from the \nsoftware engineer&#39;s vocabulary.  From the same book, page 803: &quot;Manual \ntesting is error-prone and tedious. In contracst, an automated test \nsuite will never be distracted by a phone call, type the wrong input, or \nmiss one incorrect character in 10,000 lines of output&quot;.  JUnit is a \nframework that help you (and all your co-workers) to create an automated \ntesting environment.\n\n&gt; since each\n&gt; developer will be doing this in its development\n&gt; routine\n\n\nthe developers should all use the same testing framework\n\n&gt; 3) When i have to get input from the konsole\n\n\nseparate the input (console) from the core application (what you&#39;re \ndoing with this information).  Treat your console like an input class \nthat uses your core business module.\n\n&gt; 3) In examples like fibinnaci iam able ot chack\n&gt; only for null and i cannot chack for assert equals\n&gt; because it cannot ale to give the relut value becuse\n&gt; it is dynamically displaying, how can i do i need the\n&gt; reply \n\n\nseparate the business (calculation of the suite) from the output (the \ndisplay).\n\n-Vladimir\n\n-- \nVladimir Bossicard\nwww.bossicard.com\n\n\n",
