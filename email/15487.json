I decided to try unit testing.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; So, I started with an obvious class and started to build the methods i<br/>\n&gt; thought it needed and the accompanying test class with methods that<br/>\n&gt; tested the respective methods of the class under test. As the code base<br/>\n&gt; grew I found refactoring quite a burden. Perhaps I had my intial design<br/>\n&gt; incorrect.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Then i decided to try TDD. Wow! Suddenly i was writing code to satisfy<br/>\n&gt; my tests (a client) and things seemed a lot more natural. Productivity<br/>\n&gt; increased and i built only what i needed. I think this is how<br/>\n&gt; development should happen (I have since hit a wall with testing<br/>\n&gt; non-POJOs that I am still grappling with).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; However, the tests that result from TDD are NOT unti tests. They are<br/>\n&gt; actually quite high-level. I found dropping out of TDD into unit testing<br/>\n&gt; quite hard and unnatural. Even though the resulting tests are important<br/>\n&gt; to have, i couldn&#39;t help feeling that by not writing the lower-level<br/>\n&gt; unit tests (against say a private method) I was not doing the right thing.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Does anyone understand what I mean? Have i misunderstood unit testing<br/>\n&gt; and TDD?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It sounds like your TDD tests were more of &quot;integration tests&quot; than of <br/>\n&quot;unit tests&quot;. I&#39;ll guess that you like to take a top-down approach to <br/>\ndesign. If you do, then take care to examine how many different objects <br/>\nparticipate in a test. If it&#39;s more than one, then you should consider <br/>\nwhat behavior you need from each object, then test-driving (performing <br/>\nTDD on) each object in isolation. When you think you&#39;ve built the <br/>\nbehavior you need from each object, you can put them together to pass <br/>\nthe original integration test you wrote.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is very close to Story Test-Driven Development, so you haven&#39;t <br/>\nmisunderstood TDD, but rather have noticed that one can practise TDD at <br/>\ndifferent levels of the design.<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJ.
