If this be=\r\ncomes a trend in\nthe market, it would be much easier to convince managers t=\r\nhat we\nshould embrace Unit Testing as early as possible. ;)\n\n&gt; \n&gt; The devel=\r\nopment was no picknick, TDD is not a silver bullet and you\n&gt; make mistakes =\r\nwhile you learn how to master it. This application was\n&gt; no exception.\n&gt; Af=\r\nter we went live only 2 bugs have ever been discovered and none of\n&gt; them s=\r\nerious. The other application had more than 100 reported bugs of\n&gt; differen=\r\nt levels chriticality the first week.\n&gt; \n&gt; I attribute this difference main=\r\nly to the fact that we had unit-tests\n&gt; and the others didn&#39;t (It would be =\r\ntempting to think that we were\n&gt; simply that much better and smarter but re=\r\nalistically: our choice of\n&gt; enginering approach was better in this case). =\r\nIt is also interesting\n&gt; to note that we did not need more time to finish o=\r\nur application than\n&gt; the other team did, I think that this is bvecause the=\r\ny spent more time\n&gt; in word than we did and we spent more time in code than=\r\n they did,\n&gt; relying more on our testcases to drive the design and acting o=\r\nn the\n&gt; feedback we got from our tests. In fact our server side components\n=\r\n&gt; were live 1 week before theirs.\n\n[Frank] That is pretty impressive and ju=\r\nst what I am looking forward\nto see, which makes me more confident to embra=\r\nnce JUnit-based testing. \n\n&gt; \n&gt; Do I think unit testing takes more time? Ye=\r\ns and no:\n&gt; \n&gt; Yes - because there is more code to write, and in the beginn=\r\ning there\n&gt; is a learning curve. I would say that you would experience a dr=\r\nop in\n&gt; productivity the first couple of months until you get the &quot;hang of =\r\nit&quot;\n&gt; TDD is a new way of thinking but it is worth learning. I think TDD is=\r\n\n&gt; almost as big of a change as it is to change from procvedural oriented\n&gt;=\r\n thinking to OO thinking, you never stop learning and it will take you\n&gt; ye=\r\nars to master it (although you will get benefits from it much earlier)\n\n\n[F=\r\nrank] That happens to be my guess. However, I am not sure how much\nextra ef=\r\nfort would be involved so far. \n\n&gt; No - because you tend to write less &quot;unu=\r\nsed code&quot; simply because\n&gt; having to have a test for every line of code you=\r\n write makes you\n&gt; reluctant to do &quot;might be good if I want to do this in t=\r\nhe future&quot;\n&gt; kind of design stunts. This also comes from the knowledge that=\r\n\n&gt; changing the code to support those &quot;might be good to haves&quot; is\n&gt; straigh=\r\nt forward, if you have the tests, when they change from &quot;might\n&gt; be good&quot; t=\r\no &quot;are necesary&quot;.\n&gt; Less &quot;might be good to haves&quot; alsoe leaves less product=\r\nion code to\n&gt; maintain wich saves some effort, I don&#39;t remember who said th=\r\nat he\n&gt; &quot;would rather have his developers surf the web than adding code tha=\r\nt\n&gt; did not immediately provide any value&quot;. An interesting thought.\n&gt; \n\n[Fr=\r\nank] This is pretty impressive and I did not think about thing like\nthis. \n=\r\n\n\n\n&gt; No - Because your design, with TDD, tends to be simpler, more to the\n&gt;=\r\n point and better when you drive it with tests (when you learn how to\n&gt; do =\r\nthat, before that you will just have very complicated tests and the\n&gt; same =\r\ndesign).\n&gt; Yes - Because if you have not been doing test-driven development=\r\n so\n&gt; far your design will likely be hard to test until you remedy that. To=\r\n\n&gt; fix that is time well spent since a testable design is usually an\n&gt; exte=\r\nndable one and when you have your tests you will see that you can\n&gt; add new=\r\n features faster than you thought were possible. But\n&gt; productivity will no=\r\n doubt drop until you have spent some time\n&gt; refactoring for testability (a=\r\nnd fixing what you break/try to prevent\n&gt; to break stuff while doing that s=\r\nince you have no tests at the moment)\n\n[Frank] Seems you assume Unit Testin=\r\ng natually means TDD. However, I\nsaw some others guys said although it is b=\r\nest to have Unit Testing in\nTDD process, it is not a mandatary. Do you thin=\r\nk Unit Testing can\nstill give us lots of benefits even if we do not follow =\r\nAgile\nmethodology like XP, or even not follow TDD ?\n\n\n&gt; I am not saing that=\r\n your design is bad, I&#39;m saying that it is unlikely\n&gt; to be very good for t=\r\nesting if that has not been a design-goal (from\n&gt; my experience)\n&gt; \n&gt; About=\r\n testing web-based applications and the effectiveness of unit\n&gt; tests I wou=\r\nld say that JUnit is equally appropriate for web, but, with\n&gt; JUnit you tes=\r\nt one class at the time (if you do it interaction based)\n&gt; or several class=\r\nes from one class at the time (if you are doing\n&gt; statebased testing). \n\n[F=\r\nrank] Not quite follow you here. I guess when you mentioned &quot;with\nJUnit you=\r\n test one class at the time (if you do it interaction\nbased)&quot;, what you mea=\r\nnt is to test the interaction between objects by\nusing &quot;mock objects&quot;, righ=\r\nt ?\n\n&gt; In order to find bugs in your HTML etc you need\n&gt; system tests and o=\r\nther tools (or add ons) to test that. \n\n[Frank] What exact &quot;other tools&quot; ar=\r\ne you talking about here ? like\nHttpUnit, HtmlUnit, Canoo and etc ?\n\n\n&gt; (Th=\r\ne example I\n&gt; gave you was a unit-tested serverside with a manually tested\n=\r\n&gt; presentation layer). What you want to do though is to put as little\n&gt; bus=\r\niness logic in your presentation layer as you can (that is put no\n&gt; busines=\r\nslogic there) so that all your businesslogic can be unit\n&gt; tested. When you=\r\n have that you find a lot fewer bugs in your\n&gt; presentation-layer.\n\n&gt; \n&gt; Mo=\r\nre and more tools are available testing web apps, I heard about but\n&gt; never=\r\n tried &quot;selenium&quot; try that one.  And I also recomend looking at\n&gt; www.testd=\r\nriven.com to see if you can find anything that suits you. But\n&gt; regardless =\r\nof wether you test the generated html or not you can still\n&gt; rely on the fa=\r\nct that what is beneath your presentation-layer works.\n\n\n[Frank] You are te=\r\nlling me that in this example project, you tested\nonly the biz layer code a=\r\nnd did not do any automatic testing against\nthe &quot;html/jsp&quot;, right ?\n\n \n&gt; So=\r\nrry for the blah, blah response I easilly get caught up in these\n&gt; things :=\r\n) I hope you could distill something useful from this massive\n&gt; amount of t=\r\next :)\n&gt;\n\n[Frank] Thanks a lot for your great patience to spend so much tim=\r\ne to\nshare your experience to me. I think I learned a lot from you\ncomments=\r\n. This really helps. :)\n\nCheers, \n- Frank \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
