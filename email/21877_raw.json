But, in some complex systems, it&#39;s just no=\r\nt feasible to have all tests run independently of each other. For example, =\r\nin my case, the nightly job needs to do it&#39;s work, before I can do one of t=\r\nhe tests. Furthermore, to verify that the whole process actually works, fro=\r\nm start to finish, would be impossible with independent tests. i.e. I would=\r\n not really be testing the nightly job. \n\nBut yes, I think setting up a tes=\r\nt, that is not dependant on any other test, is possible, but I would have t=\r\no hard code a bunch of stuff in the tests, and I would have to put all of t=\r\nhe tests in a single test, in order for them to succeed. And doing that wou=\r\nld prevent a bit of my actual code from being tested. \n\nOne other question =\r\nis, can I trust the order of execution of the test methods in a single Test=\r\nCase implemention? Or are all of them also supposed to be independent? \n\nTh=\r\ne reason I ask is because this is what is basically happening: There is an =\r\nexternal ASYNCHRONOUS SOAP messaging system that is the core to all communi=\r\ncation between several companies. Requests/responses can be sent to and fro=\r\nm all of the participating parties. For testing purposes, so that my tests =\r\ncan be a little more controlled, I send requests and responses to and from =\r\nmy own server. i.e. I do not send to other companies, because I cannot guar=\r\nantee they will respond within the time I need (seconds), even though techn=\r\nically, their test systems are supposed to be up and running. \n\nAlso note t=\r\nhat this is a cronjob, likely run once every night. \n\n1. submit request to =\r\nmy system, through the external system. This is effectively to test receivi=\r\nng requests from the external system, to me. i.e. I can send requests to my=\r\nself, as if they were coming from someone else&#39;s system. \n2. receive reques=\r\nt from external system \n3. queue job for nightly build of data \n4. check fo=\r\nr available data from nightly job, the next day \n5. send available data \n6.=\r\n receive the data sent in #5, and email it out to a staff member \n\nSo, what=\r\n we have here, is a complex messaging system that is not internally control=\r\nled. I agree that the majority of testing, with most projects, does not inv=\r\nolve complex scenarios like this, with so many dependencies on other system=\r\ns. And, generally, you could write independent tests. But, with something l=\r\nike this, where your tests are actually tests to make sure that your commun=\r\nication with the messaging system works, it is extremely difficult to make =\r\ntests independent of each other. \n\nThe way I see it, there is only two ways=\r\n to make testing this scenario work. \n1. put all of the tests in a single t=\r\nest, and have delays or polling to wait for the messages to come through, a=\r\nnd declare them all successful if it succeeds, or all failed if they fail. =\r\n\n2. have tests depend on the completion of each other, and have delays or p=\r\nolling to wait for the messages to come through. \n\nAny other insight, that =\r\nwould make this easier to test, would be HIGHLY appreciated. I am pretty ne=\r\nw to JUnit, and don&#39;t have a whole lot of experience with automated testing=\r\n in general. \n\nTrenton D.

Maybe a set o=\r\nf tests in a \n&gt; suite share some set up and tear down stuff. \n&gt; \n&gt; What it =\r\nlooks like here is your tests are dependent on a nightly job \n&gt; to run and =\r\nworst their order. It has always been my understanding \n&gt; that each test is=\r\n order independent. I remember early on stuff saying \n&gt; that one was not gu=\r\naranteed what order the tests would run in. \n&gt; Granted I think this randomi=\r\nzation was never done, but it was made to \n&gt; show a concept. The concept be=\r\ning, a person should be able to run a \n&gt; given failed test over and over (w=\r\nith some of source under test having \n&gt; modifications) until it passes. The=\r\nre should not be a whole series of \n&gt; steps that have to run in order to ge=\r\nt a single test to pass. \n&gt; \n&gt; I can speak from experience, requiring a pro=\r\ncedure of tests to run \n&gt; inorder to get the desired results leads to tests=\r\n that are turned off \n&gt; or forgotten about. \n&gt; \n&gt; I have some questions... =\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; Are you testing the nightly job? \n&gt; Could the initialization for Test=\r\n2.myTest() actually be setup in a \n&gt; setup method? --Then no need to rely o=\r\nn the nightly job. \n&gt; \n&gt; something you should consider... \n&gt; - &quot;Ideally, ea=\r\nch test case is independent from the others&quot; -- \n&gt; http://en.wikipedia.org/=\r\nwiki/Unit_Test \n&gt; -- Along these lines, the results of one test should not =\r\ndictate the \n&gt; results of another. \n&gt; \n&gt; Hope I added some insight, \n&gt; \n&gt; B=\r\nig Mike \n&gt; \n&gt; On Fri, Aug 14, 2009 at 11:21 PM, trenton_adams2001&lt; trenta@a=\r\nthabascau.ca &gt; wrote: \n&gt; &gt; Hi Guys, \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m just wondering.
