There is already a test. That test is breaking. Once you have<br/>\n&gt; a breaking test you don&#39;t change the API in any way until you&#39;ve fixed<br/>\n&gt; the breakage. This is a basic principle of test driven development. This<br/>\n&gt; has nothing to with making things public or not.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>If you have a failing test, but you aren&#39;t sure why it fails, and you <br/>\nsuspect the problem is in a private method, what do you generally do?<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s what I generally do:<br/>\n<br/>\n1. Back out the failing test.<br/>\n2. Make the private method public.<br/>\n3. Write a failing test for the smaller method.<br/>\n4. Fix it.<br/>\n5. Refactor.<br/>\n6. Put the original failing test back to make sure it now passes. If it <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t, then something else must be broken, so I repeat the process on <br/>\nthat.<br/>\n7. When everything is passing, refactor again.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo what do you do differently than I do?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; However making it public certainly won&#39;t cure the problem. I would<br/>\n&gt; compare that to taking off your pants in response to a bad sunburn on<br/>\n&gt; your nose. It won&#39;t help, and it will more than likely make things worse.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I honestly don&#39;t see how this analogy matters. The nose and the pants <br/>\nhave nothing to do with one another, although in our situation, the some <br/>\npublic method invokes the private method we think is broken. At least <br/>\nthere is a relationship between the two.<br/>\n<br/>\nDon&#39;t worry about the analogy. Even if I followed it, I don&#39;t think it <br/>\nwould help me understand your position any more. I would much prefer <br/>\nknowing what you do in the above case. There&#39;s obviously something I&#39;m <br/>\nmissing.<br/>\n<br/>\nTake care.<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJ. B.
