In XP, the goal of Unit Testing is to &quot;test anything that <br/>\ncould possibly break.&quot;  If that means looking inside the class then <br/>\ndo it.  White-box testing is a very efficient way to &quot;test anything <br/>\nthat could possibly break&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nQ.  Ok, how do you test protected/private methods?<br/>\n<br/>\nA.  For protected members, you have two options.  The first option is <br/>\nto have your tests in the same package, so they would have access.  <br/>\nThe second option is to use Java&#39;s reflection to make the protected <br/>\n(or private) member public.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think JUnitX has code to provide access.  I have also used <br/>\na &quot;PrivilegedAccess&quot; utility class to gain access.  I&#39;ll see if we <br/>\ncan get that code posted.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n- Greg Houston</div>",
