I&#39;d be leery of a class that generates HTML and sorts. If the\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; sort is an another class, it can be public and far easier to test.\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; I&#39;ve always wondered why most developers are highly offended by making\n&gt;  &gt; things more public for purposes of testing\n&gt; \n&gt; Here is my take: for the past twenty years, we have been taught the\n&gt; benefits of object-oriented programming and encapsulation, at school,\n&gt; in the workplace and in countless books and articles.\n&gt; \n&gt; The emphasis on testing has only received more visibility in the past\n&gt; five years, and some of its principles are indeed at odds with some of\n&gt; the OO knowledge that has been pervading the software industry for two\n&gt; decades now.\n&gt; \n&gt; After being told repeatedly that encapsulation was paramount to\n&gt; software quality, it&#39;s not always easy to let this go in favor of\n&gt; another technique, but I think the message is getting through and that\n&gt; more and more developers are becoming more aware of the pros and cons\n&gt; between &quot;extreme OO&quot; and &quot;pragmatic testing&quot;.\n&gt; \n&gt; In hindsight, I am absolutely shocked that all the teachers I had in\n&gt; school 20+ years ago that I had so much respect for had absolutely no\n&gt; inclination (and sometimes only contempt) for testing...\n\nThe #1 reason I don&#39;t reuse someone&#39;s code: I don&#39;t think it will work.\nThe #2 reason: I don&#39;t think I will be able to fit it into my design.\n\nI would venture that the key property code needs in order to promote \nreuse is that it must be reliable. I can always add another Adapter.\n-- \nJ. B.
