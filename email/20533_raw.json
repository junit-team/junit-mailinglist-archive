Yes, many people have said they want  \nto log assertions in tests because they want the warm fuzzy feedback  \nthat their tests are running and assertion what they think they are  \nasserting. Logging is just one, and in my opinion a bad, way to do  \nthis. I believe it is much better to write simpler tests.\n&gt; 1) eliminating redundant logging statements - Many logging statements\n&gt; in a JUnit test case simply output information that you&#39;ve already\n&gt; told JUnit about in your assertions. Developers often put these in as\n&gt; a &#39;sanity check&#39; to verify that the test is doing what they expected.\n&gt;\nIf your tests need such a sanity check, then I believe they should be  \nsimpler.\n&gt; 2) improving assertion messages - it&#39;s often the case that the\n&gt;\n&gt; first time you see the message for an assertion will be when the\n&gt; assertion fails, which may not happen until you run a regression test\n&gt; many moons after you coded the test. Unless you see the message\n&gt; displayed when you are developing the test, you won&#39;t realize that the\n&gt; message - if you provided one - is not be very helpful. Better\n&gt; assertion messages also help to communicate to a developer what the\n&gt; point of the assertion is both when it fails and when reading the  \n&gt; test.\n&gt;\nIf you aren&#39;t going to think about the failure message when you write  \nit, then don&#39;t write one.\n&gt; 3) see finer-grain test results. Every assertion is a mini-test on its\n&gt; own, but JUnit these mini-tests are invisible until they fail.\n&gt;\nAbsolutely not. Assertions are not mini-tests. A test is a test. If  \nyou have multiple unrelated assertions in a test, then move them into  \ntheir own tests. This leads to a number of benefits (more accurate  \ntest count metrics, more information when a test fails, easier to  \nisolate the cause of a failure).\n&gt; 4) by making logging easy, it can help to avoid the\n&gt; using-system-outs-instead-of-asserts syndrome, where new junit test\n&gt; writers will write &quot;test cases&quot; that actually just write a bunch of\n&gt; stuff to the console that the test writer then eyeballs for expected\n&gt; results\n&gt;\nWhy would anyone use JUnit to spit things out to the console? If they  \nwant output on the console, and they&#39;re not just using that as a way  \nto learn to use JUnit, then they shouldn&#39;t use JUnit.\n&gt; There are some problems with logging assertions that I have  \n&gt; encountered:\n&gt;\n&gt; 1) if iterating over a collection and asserting each element, your log\n&gt; can be overwhelmed. Maybe it would be useful to have some way of\n&gt; hinting that a particular assertion should not create notifications;\n&gt; maybe not.\n&gt;\nI don&#39;t even want to think about how slowly tests will run, and how  \nmuch time I would waste deciding which tests should log what and when.  \nIt&#39;s much easier just to add logging where I want it.\n&gt; Is there any appetite out there for adding assertion logging (or\n&gt; assertion notification) into the junit 4 framework? I would be\n&gt; happy to do the work if I thought it would be accepted into the\n&gt; main junit distribution. Or maybe this capability already exists\n&gt; in some way in junit 4 that I am not aware of?\n&gt;\nYes, there is such an appetite, but I hope there is a bigger appetite  \nnot to include it.\n----\nJ.
