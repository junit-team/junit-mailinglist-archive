    "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-527888518\">I think I was carried away yesterday for all the discussions (and sorry about<br/>\nthe mistake on Tryon&#39;s name. :)  ).<br/>\n<br/>\nLater I calmed down and thought it through and here is what I think.<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst, I think I need to show you how exactly the tests are written in the XP<br/>\ngroup I was in.  So that you know where I am coming from.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter we have the stories, assigned the task cards, we sat down and started<br/>\ncoding.  However, we don&#39;t exactly do the &#39;DESIGN&#39; part.  Sure we think of the<br/>\nstructure a little bit but we do that just to write down the steps that we need<br/>\nto achieve in order to finish the task card in hand.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith the each step, which is normally a functionality we want to add into a<br/>\nclass, we write a test method to do waht we call &#39;break the code&#39;.  The test<br/>\nwould fail and the only way to pass it is to &#39;fix&#39; the code, or actaully add the<br/>\nnew functionality we planned.  Then on the second step we add another test to<br/>\nbreak another part of the code (which can be another class), and then fix the<br/>\ncode the pass the test.  This break-and-fix pattern keeps going untill all the<br/>\nsteps are finished.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo for this order example, say we have two classes to carry out the task:  Order<br/>\nclass get an instance of Product class, which has all the product information.<br/>\n<br/>\n        Order ---- (uses) ---&gt; Product<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd to add the logic we want, we use TestOrder and MockProduct to test the Order<br/>\nclass, so it is now like this (how to &#39;trick&#39; Order class into using MockProduct<br/>\nis another story):<br/>\n<br/>\n        TestOrder --(uses)--&gt; Order --- (uses) ---&gt; MockProduct<br/>\n<br/>\nSo we add a testCreateOrder_Unavailable method, we set MockProduct to return<br/>\nUNAVAILABLE whenever the getStatus is called, and then assert that an exception<br/>\nis thrown when createOrder is called (or some other kind of errors).  The test<br/>\nwill fail and the only way to &#39;fix&#39; the code is to add the logic into Order<br/>\nclass.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo as you can see, we are concentrating on the Order class and this class only<br/>\nfor this test method.  And that is why Order class itself is considered as a<br/>\nunit.  In this way, even if a bug is introduced later into Product class, the<br/>\ntests for Order would never fail because it doesn&#39;t care what exactly the real<br/>\nProduct is.  And if the tests for Order fail anytime, we would pretty much know<br/>\nthat it has to be in either the Order class implementation or the test methods<br/>\nimpletation.<br/>\n<br/>\nHopefully, I understand Tryon&#39;s way correctly, that is:<br/>\n<br/>\n       TestClass  ---(uses)---&gt; Order ---(uses)---&gt; Product ---(uses)---&gt; ...<br/>\n<br/>\nSo that&#39;s why you consider the whole module as a unit.  The TestClass here is<br/>\nsupposed to test all the functionality (or all the possible result) from the<br/>\nbeginnig to the end.  And I think that is what the AT(Acceptance Test) or<br/>\nFunctional Test is about.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy current group is also doing this way because we have a pretty good QA team<br/>\ndedicated in writing those tests and the product is kind of too big to spend all<br/>\nthe development time on writing unit test for everything now.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nJason Tryon wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; My premise is that the tests are the design, not simply related thereto.  We<br/>\n&gt; have a list of possible results of creating an order.  These possible<br/>\n&gt; outcomes determine the things we have to test.  In creating the tests, we<br/>\n&gt; create the design.  It then becomes the tests that drive the design rather<br/>\n&gt; than being a trailing afterthought to determine whether we anwered the<br/>\n&gt; requirements.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Conventional Methodology:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;        Requirements ----&gt; Design ----&gt; Construction ----&gt; Testing -- --&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Delivery<br/>\n&gt;                             ^                                       |<br/>\n&gt;                             |-----------&lt;  Revision of Design &lt;-----|<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Suggested Methodology :<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;        Request ----&gt; Tests ----&gt; Design ----&gt; Construction -- --&gt; Delivery<br/>\n&gt;                        ^                                     |<br/>\n&gt;                        |---------&lt; Revision of Tests &lt;-------|<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; By devising the tests before construction, a couple of things are gained.<br/>\n&gt; First, the request, tests and designs are closer together in the process.<br/>\n&gt; This improves communication and the reliability of the design.  Second, the<br/>\n&gt; tests drive the development process instead of a logical design improving<br/>\n&gt; both the quality of the design and the answer the solution provides to the<br/>\n&gt; original request.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Regards,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Jason Tryon<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; P.S.  It&#39;s pronounced Try - on ... like to try on a hat.  :) </span></blockquote></div>",
