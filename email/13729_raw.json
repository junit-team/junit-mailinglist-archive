It expresses intent and shuts up the local\n&gt; &gt; critic.\n&gt;\n&gt; If this would be recommended by the JUnit inventors,\n&gt; they would have added a method like pass() or\n&gt; succeed() in their class TestCase I think.\n\nThat&#39;s quite an assumption!  No matter how good Erich and Kent may be, I \ndon&#39;t think they can think of everything (thus a version 3.8.1 instead \nof the it-is-perfect-and-nothing-else-needs-to-be-added-1.0 version). ;)\n\n&gt;\n&gt; To call a method which does nothing, makes no sense in\n&gt; my eyes. It silences Checkstyle, but is nonsense\n&gt; nevertheless. Of course methods like pass() or\n&gt; assertTrue(true) are a kind of documentation. But this\n&gt; is also a kind of documentation, and can be used\n&gt; everywhere, not just for a test:\n&gt;\nThis may be opening a can of worms, nevertheless... No-op methods are \nnot always unneccessary.  Consider the case of a TemplateMethod where an \nimplementor of the template steps may not need to do anything at a \nparticular point.  I might be able to think of other cases where I have \nintentionally called no-op methods, but they aren&#39;t popping to mind just \nnow.\n\nBesides that, a method like pass() IS intention-revealing.\n\n-- \nJason Rogers\n\n&quot;I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I,\nbut Christ liveth in me: and the life which I now live in \nthe flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved \nme, and gave himself for me.&quot;\n    Galatians 2:20\n\n\n",
