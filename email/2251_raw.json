Recently we reached\na pain threshold that&#39;s causing us to make a compromise trade\noff.  Perhaps you folks can offer some suggestions.\n\nThe developers write unit test for all layers of the system,\nfrom the web pages to the smallest methods.  For most tests,\nwe use JUnit and for the web tests we use HTTPUnit.\n\nThe highest level of the web tests check for the page flow\n(link navigation) and for page contents.  These tests, written\nwith HTTPUnit, are getting painful.  There is often a lot of\nset up needed (e.g., putting objects in the right state) to\nget to the point where the test can execute, as well as a lot\nof code to log in and navigate to the page where the test can\nrun.  In some cases, the effort to write these tests is a\nsignificant percentage of the overall task efforts.\n\nRecently, developers have stopped writing these web tests,\nresorting to running the tests manually by hand.  Their\nreasoning is that the cost of writing the web tests is not\njustified by their benefits.  Others point out the issues\nwith manual tests (inconsistent tests, the extra time to run\nthem repeatedly, lack of documentation, etc.), and assert\nthat the tests are worth the admittedly high costs.  We&#39;re\nhaving trouble reaching consensus.\n\nA related issue is that our QA folks have not been able to\nprovide a suite of automated acceptance tests, which we\npresume should also test page navigation and contents as page\nof the user functionality tests.  They use a &quot;big&quot; testing\ntool (Seque), and we&#39;re not sure if we could use their tests\nin a day-to-day development environment, if they existed.\n\nSo, in your opinion, should the developers be writing the web\npage navigation and contents tests?  IMHO, we should because\nthis stuff can break, unless we can get QA to write them as\npart of the acceptance tests and we can share the tool to run\nthem in the development environment.\n\nIf so, should the tests be automated?  IMHO, they should for\nall the same reasons we automate any tests.\n\nNow, what about the cost?  Are there ways to reduce the costs\nof writing these type of tests?  Are there other tools we\ncould be using?  At XPU, Lisa Crispin recommended WebART as\na tool at this level.  I also heard discussion of patterns\nsuch as Object Mother for creating objects in a particular\nstate for testing.  Comments here?\n\nThanks much in advance for any suggestions.\n\n-Paul Hodgetts\n\n\n",
