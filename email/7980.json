The GUI is not<br/>\nsufficient for reporting tests (which may be over 5000 running over<br/>\nhours).<br/>\n<br/>\nI have logs (using log4j) to look at but becomes awfull searching for<br/>\nfailures in maze of results. I have seen stuffs at IBM sites and also<br/>\ncan be made using<br/>\nant junitreport. But is there more easier way of making reports using<br/>\nJUnit(add-on may be).<br/>\n<br/>\nDesparately look for easier way for reporting.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks.</div>",
