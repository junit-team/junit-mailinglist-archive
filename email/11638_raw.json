Or a &quot;negative&quot; message in case the assert\nfailed.\n \nSo I have been writing\n    assertTrue(&quot;The filename should end in .log&quot;,\nfilename.endsWith(&quot;.log&quot;));\nassuming the assert doesn&#39;t fail.  \n \nAnother responder wrote &quot;this looks like a comment&quot;, and yes, it does, but\nis that a bad thing?\n \nOTOH, you would only see the message in junit output (wherever that may be)\nwhen the assert really did fail -- \nso maybe it SHOULD be a &#39;negative&#39; message, e.g. \n    assertTrue(&quot;The filename doesn&#39;t end in .log?&quot;,\nfilename.endsWith(&quot;.log&quot;));\nThis is what JB was saying.\n \nThanks\n--DP\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: Chris Wright [mailto:subscriptions@...] \nSent: Wednesday, July 21, 2004 2:11 PM\nTo: junit@yahoogroups.com\nSubject: RE: [junit] Message texts\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: David Plass [mailto:dplass@...] \nSent: Wednesday, July 21, 2004 6:56 PM\nTo: junit@yahoogroups.com\nSubject: RE: [junit] Message texts\n\n\n&gt;So you&#39;d write \n  assertTrue(&quot;someBoolean is not true!&quot;, someBoolean);\n\n&gt;Or as another example\n    assertEquals(&quot;The answer isn&#39;t the same!&quot;, expected, actual);\n\n\n\nProbably best to replace &#39;someBoolean&#39; or &#39;answer&#39; with the idea of what you\nare testing, as in &#39;The surname did not match the one I was looking for&#39;.\nOr, &#39;The ages of the clients are not equal&#39;.\n\nI am sure you probably have quite a few booleans in your code that you are\nchecking, but JB&#39;s suggestion was to put something meaningful that you can\ncome back and recognise when debugging later on.  Having just &#39;someBoolean&#39;\ndoes not really tell you much does it... \nHaving an individual description will let you know exactly where the failure\noccurred, but creates just that little bit of overhead when creating the\nassertion itself.\n\n\nRegards\n\nCW\n\n\n\n\nYahoo!
