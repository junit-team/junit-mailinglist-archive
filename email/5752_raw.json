As a developer, I usually have much control over the\nway my code is used. It is only the published interface I don&#39;t have\n&quot;full control&quot; over - I would agree that for that (hopefully rather\nsmall interface) your definition of robustness applies.\n\n&gt; Actually, I&#39;m sure that contingency is addressed by the\n&gt; automotive industry. Now bringing fire near any body of\n&gt; petrol is bad, but there are ways to reduce the likelihood of\n&gt; a bad thing. Baffles in the tube leading to the petrol tank\n&gt; are an example of trying to provide hardware guard conditions.\n\nAfaik they don&#39;t guard against putting nitroglycerin into the petrol\ntank... ;)\n\n&gt; The project that I am winding up\n&gt; now is not life threatening, but because of volume, it does\n&gt; need to be very fast and very accurate or the CEO will be\n&gt; asking why it is failing to process about 2000 shipments an\n&gt; hour! (Not a conversation that I ever want to have!) I still\n&gt; think that it&#39;s appropriate to &quot;harden&quot; our code to handle\n&gt; the unexpected.\n\nAren&#39;t the goals of fast code, robust code (against misuse) and fast\ndevelopment rather competing?\n\n&gt; This is the concept of &quot;graceful degredation&quot;. A web browser\n&gt; is a very good example of this .... a lot of web pages have\n&gt; awful HTML and yet most of them display acceptably, because\n&gt; the browser takes what it&#39;s given and does the best it can\n&gt; with it. A browser cannot throw an exception, but it can try\n&gt; to render what it&#39;s given. All software should do the best it\n&gt; can with what it&#39;s given or when possible reject unacceptable inputs.\n\nYes, it probably is a good idea to make the external interface rather\nrobust. But I think that the balance changes for internal communication\nof the system.\n\nRegards, Ilja\n\n\n",
