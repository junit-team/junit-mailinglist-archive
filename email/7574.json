I apologize and request to allow me to express myself once<br/>\nand retreat for ever. No follow up replies from me irrespective of its<br/>\nintensity.<br/>\nJames, if you wish we can continue this discussion in<br/>\ncomputerbooksandauthors as I see this an interesting topic for me to<br/>\nwrite a book on “Behavioral trends in changing economic scenarios” !! <br/>\n <br/>\nIn the recent years I have observed a very peculiar behavior from the<br/>\nprofessionals in the USA which reminds of those days of Marxism,<br/>\nLeninism<br/>\nJust because their jobs are at stake they started to react saying that<br/>\ntheir government should adopt protectionist measures without really<br/>\nadmitting that they are no more delivering value for money. Did you ever<br/>\nthink that there were so many talented jobless in other parts of the<br/>\nworld whose talents were not put to good use prior to globalization. If<br/>\none advocates the right to equality and right to freedom of<br/>\naccessibility, one should pursue it till the end and should not change<br/>\ntones in between.<br/>\n <br/>\nThese countries (India and China) which you are referring to where<br/>\ncriticized by governments in advanced countires for having protectionist<br/>\npolicies and were advised to open up and allow globalization. Now that<br/>\nthese countries are serious about opening up their markets and expect<br/>\nother countries to reciprocate by allowing them sell what they sell the<br/>\nbest, why all this hue and cry ?!!<br/>\nWhile hardware selling is China’s strength, selling software services<br/>\nis India’s strength partly attributed to its attractive rates.<br/>\nShouldn’t we allow others also to sell their expertise or is it written<br/>\nin the bible that only the USA is privileged to sell its ideas to whole<br/>\nworld.<br/>\n <br/>\nExcuse me if my tone seems to be abnormal. But that’s the reality and<br/>\nit bites.<br/>\n <br/>\nTo answer Scotts question, it costs 30 to 40% cheaper taking into<br/>\naccount all hidden costs like travel costs of project managers,<br/>\nimplementation teams, internet connectivity costs etc.<br/>\n <br/>\nRegards<br/>\n <br/>\nRajesh<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.zudha.com\">http://www.zudha.com</a><br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Scott Stirling [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:scottstirling@...\">scottstirling@...</a>] <br/>\nSent: Sunday, April 06, 2003 11:35 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [offtopic] RE: [junit] The Responsible CIO<br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; From: James [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jm04469@...\">jm04469@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Working on writing an article for an upcoming issue of<br/>\n&gt; a magazine targeted towards CIOs. Here is the basic<br/>\n&gt; thought:<br/>\n </span></blockquote>[snip]<br/>\n<br/>\nI think this post is pretty offtopic.  But, you used the word &quot;Agile,&quot;<br/>\nso, I<br/>\nread it and am replying.<br/>\n<br/>\nInteresting article thoughts.  Also quite &quot;high level&quot; and speculative,<br/>\nwhich made me wonder about some facts.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor instance, what&#39;s the typical salary for a senior or principal<br/>\ndeveloper<br/>\nin India?  How much is their salary affected by whether that engineer is<br/>\nworking out of Bombay or a suburb or some small city?  Just curious what<br/>\nthe<br/>\nCIOs are up against in their decision process -- how much money can be<br/>\nsaved<br/>\non a project by outsourcing some of the work?  What are the most<br/>\nsuccessful<br/>\nways to leverage outsourcing help?<br/>\n<br/>\nHow much is outsourcing the decision of a CIO?  I&#39;ve seen outsourcing<br/>\nproposed and advocated at the department Director and VP level, though<br/>\nthe<br/>\nCIO is usually involved to approve any large IT/Dev expenditure.  Of<br/>\ncourse<br/>\nwith job title inflation the past few years, there are lots of &quot;CIOs&quot; of<br/>\nlittle start-ups too.  Anyway, is this typically a decision the CIO<br/>\nwould<br/>\nreally dig into?  Or is it a lower level decision just needing financial<br/>\napproval at the higher level?<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m curious why we can&#39;t get more U.S. people employed in the computer<br/>\nprofessions.  Every place I&#39;ve worked in the past few years (including a<br/>\ncouple big time software companies) has had several H1 Visa employees,<br/>\nusually Indian or Chinese.  I&#39;ve found that these folks vary in their<br/>\nexperience and technical expertise as much as anyone else I&#39;ve worked<br/>\nwith.<br/>\n<br/>\nFinally, there&#39;s the notion of Agile CIO, which is intriguing.  But is<br/>\nit<br/>\njust b.s.?  I mean, CIOs are high level managers, not developers.  How<br/>\ndo<br/>\nyou presume to apply agile methods at the CIO level in more than tenuous<br/>\nanalogies?  I think it quite possible the whole notion of CIO is contra<br/>\nagile methodology.<br/>\n<br/>\nScott Stirling<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYahoo!
