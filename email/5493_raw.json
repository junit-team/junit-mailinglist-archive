Think carefully\nabout the messages.  Where do they belong?  What type of object should\nanswer them?  I often cringe about &#39;promising&#39; too much from my objects\nbecause it means I will end up needing to support it.  But I am soothed\nwhen I find just the right object that does just the right thing; then I\ndon&#39;t mind making those sort of promises to the system.  This comes\nthrough much refactoring! I never get it right the first time.  So, I\nhave learned to deal with the cringes, confident that sooner or later\nthey will be soothed.  So, my suggestion &lt;sorry for the long rant&gt; is\nthat you begin by opening up the methods.  When the cringe becomes to\nmuch to bear think more critically about who can answer that question\nfor you.  Refactor mercilessly!!\n\n=jason\n\nOn Mon, 2002-07-29 at 20:49, Dave Astels wrote: On Mon, 2002-07-29 at\n18:41, p_d_w_219 wrote:\n&gt; The methods that I most want to test are often the ones I want to \n&gt; declare as private. That makes them inaccessible to my testing \n&gt; harness.\n&gt; \n&gt; I could be designing my classes improperly for use with JUnit or \n&gt; perhaps I&#39;m setting JUnit up incorrectly. Could anyone offer me so \n&gt; guidance on this issue.\n\nHere&#39;s my take on the subject, from a Test-driven Development\nperspective.\n\nYou write your test first, calling whatever methods you need on the\nclass you are developing.  Those methods are naturally public, since\nthey are external behaviour.  This means that all methods called by\ntests are public.\n\nAs you refactor you will be creating private methods (as you extract\nmethods and so on).  These do not need to be explicitly tested, as the\nbahaviour of the class has not changed... just details of where the code\nresides.\n\nSo... tests drive the creation of public methods, refactoring drives the\ncreation of private methods.\n\nThere are times when one of these private, created-due-to-refactoring\nmethods is useful to call from outside.  Then you make it public.  With\nTDD you will already have a test in place, when you realize that an\nexisting private method does what you need.\n\nSummary: You don&#39;t need to test private methods if you&#39;re doing TDD\nrigorously.\n\nDave\n-- \nDave Astels (dave@...)\n  Coauthor of &quot;A Practical Guide to XP&quot;\n  Editor of the Test-Driven Development Edition of The Coad Letter\n    (subscribe at www.thecoadletter.com)\n  Presenter at XP2002 (www.xp2002.org) of:\n    the &quot;XP For One&quot; tutorial & &quot;Refactoring with UML&quot; paper\nCEO & Master Software Craftsman, Saorsa Development Inc.\nwww.saorsa.com\n&quot;An Agile Software Studio&quot;\n\n\n\n\nYahoo!
