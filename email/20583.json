Feel free to skip it.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; If, however, you find yourself a little mystified about your<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; test case&#39;s behaviour, you have the option of turning on<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the log to get another view on what the test case is doing.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Alternately you could run the test in a debugger. Or you could<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; start writing a bunch of hand-crafted logging statements since<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; logging is sometimes more effective than debugging.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; But in some cases the assertion log would already be logging what<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; you need to know without your having to write those statements.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; It&#39;s just another tool that is sometimes useful. Debuggers<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; are important, but you don&#39;t have to use them.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ...or you could write smaller, more focused tests and learn  <br/>\n&gt; something<br/>\n&gt; &gt; about design.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Is this a fair statement to make? You&#39;ve never met Phil nor have you<br/>\n&gt; seen any of his test cases. You&#39;ve no idea if he writes small focused<br/>\n&gt; tests or not.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I think we can all learn to do a better job but I don&#39;t think this<br/>\n&gt; sort of reply serves either Phil or you well. Perhaps if this<br/>\n&gt; discussion were face to face that would have helped us all.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I agree, and on re-reading the statement, I can see how one could  <br/>\ninterpret it to be much more nasty than I intended it. I apologize to  <br/>\nPhil. I did not mean the comment to be nasty, but rather to offer an  <br/>\nalternative in a nice, neutral, non-judgmental tone of voice. Honest.<br/>\n<br/>\nPhil, you might already know a bunch about design, you might have  <br/>\nrelatively little experience. Either way, if you have not experienced  <br/>\nthe effect of writing small, focused tests, I recommend it. You will  <br/>\ncertainly learn something about design and you might find you don&#39;t  <br/>\nmuch want to log assertions anymore.<br/>\n<br/>\nI meant to say that the first time.<br/>\n----<br/>\nJ.
