They are two different techniques, and you need <br/>\n&gt;both.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Tests are written by the provider to verify that the *provider*&#39;s code <br/>\n&gt;is correct. DBC is written by the provider to verify that the *client*&#39;s <br/>\n&gt;code is correct. This is a critical distinction. The provider can rely <br/>\n&gt;on their own tests, but they cannot rely on the clients&#39;.<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I think the line is fuzzier than that.  Postconditions don&#39;t verify the <br/>\nclient. <br/>\n<br/>\nTo me, the difference is like the difference between an endoskeleton <br/>\n(checked DbC) and an exoskeleton (UTs).  Both provide support for motion <br/>\nin different ways.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe sneaky thing about DbC is that if you want to use its assertions <br/>\nessentially as tests you have to exercise your code.  It&#39;s not just a <br/>\nmatter of writing the assertions.  When you test, the code that you <br/>\nwrite is the exercising code, and you can test both clients and <br/>\nproviders.  Not saying that DbC is bad, just that I wouldn&#39;t want to <br/>\nrely on its assertion mechanism rather than tests.  On the other hand, I <br/>\nfeel oddly comfortable writing code with lots of tests and no embedded <br/>\nDbC constructs.<br/>\n<br/>\nMichael Feathers<br/>\nwww.objectmentor.com</div>",
