I have also felt this need in the past. When I<br/>\n&gt; observed that I could solve many of the same problems by writing<br/>\n&gt; smaller, more focused tests, not only did I stop wanting to log<br/>\n&gt; assertions, but my designs improved and I delivered more solid<br/>\n&gt; features sooner.

For the most part I don&#39;t think I would use this feature a<br/>\nwhole ton but there is one case that I can of.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I&#39;m invited to come and help with a project which is struggling<br/>\nwith their tests (not having done TDD from the start), I can see using<br/>\nthe log files as a way of helping me better understand what&#39;s going<br/>\non. Are there tests without assertions? Are there tests with many<br/>\nassertions? etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know that Cedric suggested using log files to measure change in the<br/>\nnumber of tests etc. That sounds like work - currently we just count<br/>\nthe number of tests and use EclEmma for coverage. Not perfect - but it<br/>\nonly takes a few minutes.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo for it me it would be a tool of some, but not the greatest value.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers<br/>\nMark<br/>\n----------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nBlog: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.notesfromatooluser.com/\">http://www.notesfromatooluser.com/</a><br/>\nOne Year of Scrum: Lessons Learned<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.notesfromatooluser.com/2007/10/one-year-of-scr.html\">http://www.notesfromatooluser.com/2007/10/one-year-of-scr.html</a><br/>\nAperture vs. Lightroom - best comparisons<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.notesfromatooluser.com/2007/02/aperture_vs_lig.html\">http://www.notesfromatooluser.com/2007/02/aperture_vs_lig.html</a><br/>\nCustomer Retention Department - Vonage Customer Service Sucks<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.notesfromatooluser.com/2007/06/customer_retent.html\">http://www.notesfromatooluser.com/2007/06/customer_retent.html</a></div>",
