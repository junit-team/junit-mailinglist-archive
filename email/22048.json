One thing worth discussing as a<br/>\nteam is if you&#39;ve already tested everything that could possibly go<br/>\nwrong.  For example, imagine that you&#39;re collecting a customer&#39;s<br/>\npayment information, and want to test the software&#39;s behavior when the<br/>\npayment information is rejected.  Further, it could be rejected<br/>\nbecause:<br/>\n<br/>\n- The credit card number is invalid<br/>\n- The card has expired<br/>\n- The card address does not match the address given<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I was starting to get bored, I&#39;d probably test all of these<br/>\nscenarios with unit or functional tests, and just one with a UI test,<br/>\nfiguring that if all those tests worked, the odds would be low that UI<br/>\ntests of the other scenarios would reveal new information.<br/>\n<br/>\nDoes this make sense?<br/>\n<br/>\n   David<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Fri, Nov 13, 2009 at 11:55 AM, Inanc Gumus &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:inanc.gumus@...\">inanc.gumus@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; There is a library which contains service/domain/infrastructure layers.

If we try to reuse the scenarios this adds to the obscurity of tests.
