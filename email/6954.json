    "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-295752958\">Hiya, having just started a new job, as way of getting my head around some <br/>\nof the code, I was asked to write some unit tests, and after writing a heap <br/>\nof them, I noticed that the test itself was always the same, which just <br/>\ndifferent settings.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was also told that they&#39;d like our testing guy to be able to make up new <br/>\ntests on the fly, so I wrote a new test which loaded an XML file, which <br/>\ntook care of defining what I wanted to test for, and get back.  The test <br/>\ncode looks like this:<br/>\n<br/>\n   public void testUnmarshelledMessage()  {<br/>\n<br/>\n        try {<br/>\n            File path = new File(&quot;/home/mark/testmessages&quot;);<br/>\n            File[] files = path.listFiles();<br/>\n<br/>\n            for (int i = 0; i &lt; files.length; i++) {<br/>\n                File file = files[i];<br/>\n                if ( file.getName().startsWith(&quot;test&quot;) && <br/>\nfile.getName().endsWith(&quot;xml&quot;)) {<br/>\n                    Reader reader = new FileReader( file.getAbsoluteFile() <br/>\n);<br/>\n                    TestMessage testMessage = (TestMessage) readObject( <br/>\nreader );<br/>\n                    MessageStatus result = sender.send( <br/>\ntestMessage.getMessage() );<br/>\n                    assertEquals( file.getName() + &quot;(&quot; + <br/>\ntestMessage.getName() + &quot;)&quot;,<br/>\n                        testMessage.getResult(), result.getStatusCode() );<br/>\n                }<br/>\n            }<br/>\n        } catch ( Exception e ) {<br/>\n            fail( e.getMessage() );<br/>\n        }<br/>\n<br/>\n    }<br/>\n<br/>\nSo the test finds all files starting with test and ending with xml in the <br/>\nspecified directory, calls readObject() to unmarshall the XML file into my <br/>\nTestMessage object, and does the test, and checks the result.  This is all <br/>\nworking nicely, untill I wrote a test that failed.<br/>\n<br/>\nBecause this test is just that, one test, once it failed, none of the other <br/>\nXML files got processed.  So I&#39;ve been trying to think of a way around it, <br/>\na way to run my test method against each XML file as its own test.<br/>\n<br/>\nI had thought of writing a custom TestSuite which took the path, found the <br/>\nfiles, and added a custom TestCase with the filename ( instead of method <br/>\nname ), and moving the actual test code above into the custom TestCase, <br/>\nhowever I&#39;m not quite sure the best way to implement this.<br/>\n<br/>\nAny ideas?<br/>\n<br/>\nMark</div>",
