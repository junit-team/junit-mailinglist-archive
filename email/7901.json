Is the expectation that the error message should give all <br/>\nthe information necessary to identify the bug?<br/>\n<br/>\nOr is it expected that the developer have knowledege of (or discover) <br/>\nwhat the test is doing? or run the test in debug mode? or other?<br/>\n<br/>\nWe are testing methods that take xml Strings as parameters and return <br/>\nxml. It would be nice to see what was passed in and what was returned <br/>\nif anything .. even when something like a NullPointerException is <br/>\nfailing the test. Also we are running the tests in different <br/>\nenvironments so a developer may not see the same error if they run <br/>\nthe test in the development environment.<br/>\n<br/>\nIs a separate logging mechanism the answer?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks in advance for any pointers.</div>",
