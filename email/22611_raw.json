I have come across the documentation at http://www.junit.org/apidoc=\r\ns/org/junit/runner/manipulation/Sorter.html but it doesn&#39;t fully describe h=\r\now to use it.  I don&#39;t see a sort annotation, and I was hoping you didn&#39;t h=\r\nave to extend the Suite class, overload all of the constructors, and then c=\r\nall the sort method.  The documentation points to a Request.sortWith(Compar=\r\nator) method, but how do I intercept my Suite and call that method when run=\r\nning the tests through Ant, Mvn, or an eclipse JUnit execution?  \n\nI&#39;m awar=\r\ne JUnit tests are unit tests that shouldn&#39;t need to be ordered, but we have=\r\n a fairly heavy handed set of side effects produced on win32 that I&#39;m tryin=\r\ng to automate using JUnit.  My only other option is to use TestNG, but I&#39;m =\r\ntrying to standardize on JUnit.  Any and all tips, even if you&#39;re pointing =\r\nme to the right documentation is GREATLY appreciated!\n\n\n",
