The GUI is not\nsufficient for reporting tests (which may be over 5000 running over\nhours).\n\nI have logs (using log4j) to look at but becomes awfull searching for\nfailures in maze of results. I have seen stuffs at IBM sites and also\ncan be made using\nant junitreport. But is there more easier way of making reports using\nJUnit(add-on may be).\n\nDesparately look for easier way for reporting.\n\nThanks.\n\n\n\n\n\n",
