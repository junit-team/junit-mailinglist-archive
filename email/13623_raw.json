That&#39;s what class invariants are for. Each public method is \natomic. It is invoked when an object is any legal state and when the \nmethod returns it is always careful to leave the object in one of the \nlegal states (barring bad synchronization and complicated multithreaded \nissues).\n\nEach method must carefully document it&#39;s behavior under all legal \nstates. In a few cases that might lead to an exception being thrown but \nthat&#39;s rare. I never throw an IllegalStateException. I do throw \nIllegalArgumentExceptions or equivalent, and I do throw exceptions that \nindicate a problem in the environment external to my code. I suppose you \nmight consider this a prerequisite violation. (For instance, the DNS \nserver running might be a prerequisite to looking up a name with a DNS \nclass.) However, a situation where public method A must be invoked \nbefore method B is a code smell. This normally indicates to me that \nneither A nor B should be public. Instead we should make A and B private \nand create a method C that invokes A, then B.\n\n-- \nElliotte Rusty Harold  elharo@...\nXML in a Nutshell 3rd Edition Just Published!\nhttp://www.cafeconleche.org/books/xian3/\nhttp://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0596007647/cafeaulaitA/ref=nosim\n\n",
