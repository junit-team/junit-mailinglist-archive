Rainsberger [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jbr@...\">jbr@...</a>]<br/>\n </span></blockquote>...<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;...<br/>\n&gt; &gt; (How can a test show that the caller is responsible for not <br/>\n&gt; &gt; passing in a null pointer?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I do this by *not* testing that I can handle the null <br/>\n&gt; pointer. The absence of <br/>\n&gt; a test indicates &quot;undefined behavior&quot; and you shouldn&#39;t rely <br/>\n&gt; on undefined <br/>\n&gt; behavior. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>How can the absence of a test specify anything reliably?  (How does <br/>\nthe user know that you&#39;re trying to say that the behavior is undefined <br/>\nand that you didn&#39;t just forget to test that case?)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; Because tests, being code, can&#39;t relate code to external concepts.  <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; (A specification can say that a function f returns the mathematical<br/>\n&gt; &gt; sum of two given integers subject to the limitations of 32-bit<br/>\n&gt; &gt; signed binary arithmetic.  How can a test say something like that?)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I would think that the name of the method says it, <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Then you completely missed the example I just gave.  Note the number<br/>\nof terms necessary to define the behavior of the function.  Would you <br/>\never name a function with that level of precision or description?  <br/>\n(Don&#39;t use that exact example, since 32-bit binary values are already <br/>\ndefined in Java.)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; I, for one, would be very interested to see Sun&#39;s servlet API <br/>\n&gt; described in a <br/>\n&gt; test suite.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I would hate to see _only_ a test suite.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou know, this makes me think of things like Ada and some network<br/>\nprotocols, which have a detailed specification _and_ a test suite.<br/>\n<br/>\nHaving just the test suite would be a horrible way to learn Ada or a<br/>\nprotocol enough to implement it, or even just to use it.<br/>\n<br/>\n(Actually, doesn&#39;t Sun have a J2EE test suite?)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nDaniel</div>",
