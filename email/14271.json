From my point of view this <br/>\n&gt;&gt; is definitely a very good reason to have it.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; OK. I can see that, but I think that&#39;s a very bad idea. A JUnit <br/>\n&gt; assertion test failure is not at all the same thing as a Java language <br/>\n&gt; assert failure. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Not very sure they are so different in nature. According to the definition:<br/>\n<br/>\n[quote]<br/>\nAn assertion is a statement in the JavaTM programming language that enables you to test your <br/>\nassumptions about your program.<br/>\n[/quote]<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is exactly what your tests are doing: test assumptions about your program.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey are two different things and they should be<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; distinguishable. Failure to do that might cause unexpected problems with <br/>\n&gt; various tools that interpret an AssertionError as meaning one thing when <br/>\n&gt; JUnit makes it mean something different.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>sorry i have to disagree.<br/>\n<br/>\n:alex |.::the_mindstorm::.|</div>",
