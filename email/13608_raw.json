B. Rainsberger\n\n&gt; The second question is perhaps more of a comment tha=\r\nn a \n&gt; question. I think that when a novice asks us a question, it&#39;s \n&gt; OK =\r\nfor us to provide a simple, dogmatic-sounding answer. This \n&gt; person is lea=\r\nrning, and is therefore not well-informed about \n&gt; the consequences of the =\r\nchoices he has in front of him. As a \n&gt; result, we have a responsibility to=\r\n suggest the course we \n&gt; think is right and ask him to try it so he can le=\r\narn the way \n&gt; we did. In this case, a little dogma doesn&#39;t hurt. \n\nI hear =\r\nyou, but I still have a fundamental dislike for any kind of absolutes\n(and =\r\nin particular, statements that contain &quot;always&quot; or &quot;never&quot;).\n\nInstead of sa=\r\nying &quot;Never do X&quot;, I much prefer to phrase my response in terms\nof &quot;If you =\r\ndo X, here is what you gain, and here are the risks&quot;.\n\nI have been in this =\r\nbusiness for long enough that I can confidentially say\nthat whatever absolu=\r\nte statement you make, I&#39;ll be able to come up with a\ncounter example :-)\n\n=\r\n-- \nC=E9dric\nhttp://beust.com/weblog\n \n\n\n",
