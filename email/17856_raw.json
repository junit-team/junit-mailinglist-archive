This means our class \nunder test has to create the real exiter itself and during testing we \nneed to use a hook into this creation, so we can over ride it and \nprovide our fake.\n\nFirst lets rewrite the class so it creates the exiter....\n\npublic class SomethingThatCallsExit {\n\n   public int add(int num1, int num2) {\n       if( num1 &lt; 0) {\n          //System.exit(2);\n          SystemExiter systemExiter = createExiter();\n         exiter.exit(2);\n      }\n      return num1 + num2;\n   }\n\n  // real implementation\n   protected SystemExiter createExiter() {\n      return new RealSystemExiter();\n   }\n\n}\n\n\nNow lets write the test to over ride the &#39;createExiter()&#39; method to \nreturn our fake.\n\npublic class SomethingThatCallsExitTests extends Testcase {\n\n    public class TestableSomethingThatCallsExit extends  \nSomethingThatCallsExit{\n     \n         protected SystemExiter createExiter() {\n             return systemExiter;\n         }\n\n    }\n\n  \n\n  public void testTryingToAddNegativeNumberStopsApp () {\n      systemExiter = new FakeSystemExiter();\n      TestableSomethingThatCallsExit calc = new \nTestableSomethingThatCallsExit ();\n\n      calc.add( -1 , 1);\n\n     assertTrue(&quot;Exit not called!&quot;, exiter.wasExitCalled );    \n  }\n}\n\n\n\nSo there you go....two ways of injecting a fake exiter into the class \nunder test, so that we can test it without the real System.exit() being \ncalled.\n\nHTH\n\nAndrew\n\n\nBob Russell wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;m involved on a project as the QA. To improve my development\n&gt; skills and my JUnit skills, I am writing some JUnit tests. Today, I\n&gt; found that the developer had implemented System.exit(n) throughout\n&gt; the application whenever there was a trapped exception.\n&gt;\n&gt; Now, the requirements call for the application to return some exit\n&gt; code telling any downstream processes whether this application was\n&gt; 100% successful with no warnings (rc=0), 100% successful with\n&gt; warnings (rc=4), not successful at all (rc=8). However, the only\n&gt; java mechanism for reporting return codes is System.exit(n), based on\n&gt; my use of Google.\n&gt;\n&gt; My JUnit dilemma then, is that System.exit(n) gives the required\n&gt; application behavior but doesn&#39;t seem to be good for running JUnit\n&gt; tests from a test suite since System.exit(n) ends the JVM.\n&gt;\n&gt; Does anyone have any insights they can share? Since this is my first\n&gt; post to this forum, I&#39;m happy to Google some more if you&#39;ll only give\n&gt; me some keyword hint(s) beyond what I&#39;ve already tried: &quot;java exit\n&gt; code&quot;.\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks!\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; No virus found in this incoming message.\n&gt; Checked by AVG Free Edition.\n&gt; Version: 7.1.405 / Virus Database: 268.12.2/441 - Release Date: 07/09/2006\n&gt;   \n\n\n",
