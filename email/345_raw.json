It doesn&#39;t use &#39;fake&#39; server objects \nas it runs your tests in the server&#39;s engine.\n\nhttp://j2eeunit.sourceforge.net\n\nThanks.\nVincent.\n\n--- In junit@y..., Magnus Rydin &lt;magnus.rydin@c...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Dear sirs,\n&gt; im trying to find out the best generic way of JUnit testing J2ee\n&gt; applications.\n&gt; That would mean testing EJBs, Servlets and JSP pages, as well as \nall the\n&gt; &#39;normal&#39; beans and helper classes.\n&gt; Although I&#39;ve found some guidelines to how such testing could be \nperformed,\n&gt; a lot of these promotes the usage of custom made &#39;fake&#39; application \nservers\n&gt; and Request/Response wrappers for the Servlet testing. This feels \nextremely\n&gt; heavy..\n&gt; Is there a recommended approach that someone had good results with?\n&gt; Im thinking in the lines of having all the test cases in a separate \nWAR or\n&gt; EAR, and maybee incorporate log4j to simplify the testing.\n&gt; \n&gt; But using printing to log4j as a result source would give the \nproduction\n&gt; code a unwanted overhead as well as be a very ugly way of conduct.\n&gt; \n&gt; Please, if you&#39;ve got a good design for JUnit testing in the J2EE\n&gt; environment, share it with me.\n&gt; \n&gt; WR\n\n\n",
