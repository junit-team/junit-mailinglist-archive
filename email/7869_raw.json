We&#39;ve been using a more manual \nsolution to simulate what you&#39;re talking about integrating. Our driving \nreason isn&#39;t listed on the blog you referenced: we often find that in \nthe course of Test Driven Development we&#39;ll think of a test (say a \ncorner case) that we don&#39;t want to forget.\n\nWe quickly moved from sticking post-it notes on the screen or writing \nand commenting out (at least a stub of) the test to just writing the \ntest (or stub) and leaving it in place.  But we had to choose between \nusing no asserts (and never being reminded of the unimplemented test) \nand forcing failures (which can be more of a distraction than a reminder).\n\nOur manual solution involves temporarily wrapping the body of an \nunimplemented test in a conditional that can be globally toggled on/off \nfor all tests.  It works very nicely, for a manual solution, but should \ndefinitely be integrated into the tools.\n\nTake care,\n\n- Russ\n\n\nBill Venners wrote:\n\n&gt;Hello All,\n&gt;\n&gt;I&#39;m curious how many JUnit users want a way to temporarily mark certain \n&gt;test methods so that the runner doesn&#39;t execute them, but reports that \n&gt;they are skipped. This is a functionality that Vladimir R. Bossicard \n&gt;provides via his JUnit Add-Ons runner, which he describes in his first \n&gt;blog post:\n&gt;\n&gt;http://www.artima.com/weblogs/viewpost.jsp?thread=4603\n&gt;\n&gt;I&#39;m considering whether or not it makes sense to do something similar \n&gt;for SuiteRunner, and I&#39;d like to know what JUnit users would really \n&gt;want. If you do want something like this, for what specific use cases \n&gt;do you imagine you&#39;d use it?\n&gt;\n&gt;Thanks.\n&gt;\n&gt;Bill\n&gt;--\n&gt;Bill Venners\n&gt;Artima Software, Inc.\n&gt;http://www.artima.com\n&gt;\n\nI n d u s t r i a l   L o g i c ,  I n c .\nRuss Rufer\nExtreme Programmer & Coach\nhttp://industriallogic.com\nhttp://industrialxp.org\nhttp://groups.yahoo.com/group/SiliconValleyPatterns/\n866-540-8336 (toll free)\n510-540-8336 (phone)\n\n\n\n\n",
