I think my process is good because I \ndon&#39;t\n&gt; need to consider whether an interface I&#39;m developing now will be\n&gt; workable in the future; I just need to get it to work with what I \nneed\n&gt; now--a much simpler and faster job--and leave it at that. And it&#39;s \ngood\n&gt; for my code because it keeps my code smaller, more easily \nmodifiable,\n&gt; and less likely to have bugs.\n\nAlso on point is the fact that, as an Agilist, my goal is to deliver \nthe software that my client needs at delivery and not the software \nthat my client needed six months ago. To do that, I have to manage \nchange, rather than resist it. So it is with the code itself.\n\nIt is true that progress slows in the face of change, but only if \nthere is not an effective way to manage change. Tests are the safety \nnet that help us manage the risk of changing code; therefore, in the \npresence of tests, change should be simple, even if not easy. In \nother words, the tests enable refactoring, which enable us to adapt \nto the changing needs of our customers.\n\nNow it is also true that interfaces should converge to stability \nover time; but forcing them to do so ignores important information. \nThere must be a reason why this natural convergence does not happen \nin a given situation. Therein, perhaps, lies a problem that we need \nto solve. Rather than ignore the problem or steamroller over it, we \nshould examine it and deal with it.\n\n-- JBR.\n\n\n\n",
