For\nexample, although a single lecture=\r\nr, single class, and two rooms isn&#39;t\nenough to test every available case, i=\r\nt&#39;s probably enough to feed to a\nsimple room-assignment test, etc.\n\nIn this=\r\n case, if I find myself making the same chain of calls over and\nover, I som=\r\netimes write convenient factory methods in my test class,\nso my tests can l=\r\nook like:\n\n@Test public void scheduleRoom() {\n   Scenario s =3D scenario(le=\r\ncturer(&quot;Smith&quot;),\n                      schoolClass(&quot;Algebra: requires 50 se=\r\nats&quot;),\n                      rooms(&quot;Smith Hall 100: 50 seats&quot;, &quot;Smith Hall\n=\r\n102: 20 seats&quot;))\n   assertEquals(&quot;Smith Hall 102&quot;, s.getAssignments().getRo=\r\nom(&quot;Algebra&quot;))\n}\n\nGood luck,\n\n   David Saff\n\nOn Mon, Sep 20, 2010 at 4:47 P=\r\nM, Konrad Reiche &lt;home@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; =A0Hey everyone!\n&gt;\n&gt; I am cu=\r\nrrently developing a course scheduler for universites in Java. My\n&gt; team an=\r\nd me chose test driven development, espcially for the scheduler\n&gt; itself. I=\r\n am using JUnit. For nearly every class there has to be JUnit\n&gt; test class.=\r\n The database schema has become quiet big. Not everything is\n&gt; needed for t=\r\nhe OR-mapped classes in the scheduler. In the end there are\n&gt; still 14 clas=\r\nses.\n&gt;\n&gt; As the scheduler has to be highly configurable, we need classes li=\r\nke:\n&gt; courses, lecturers, students, features, rooms, roomRequiredFeatures,\n=\r\n&gt; timeSlot, lecturerPrefferredTimeSlots, and so on. I wanted to use the\n&gt; @=\r\nBefore annotations to create fixtures (instantiated test objects to\n&gt; test)=\r\n. These test objects reflect one example of a data set from the\n&gt; database.=\r\n\n&gt;\n&gt; As a matter of fact, the 14 classess are not very detailed: maybe 3-4\n=\r\n&gt; fields. The problem arises as they are bound really tight to each other.\n=\r\n&gt; THis results in 220 lines code of instanation in the @Before method\n&gt; whi=\r\nch is way to much. A common way to deal with this is to write\n&gt; mockups, wh=\r\nich simulate the test objects behaviour. But as the classes\n&gt; are very simp=\r\nle there is no way to simulate them.\n&gt;\n&gt; I am a little bit desperate becaus=\r\ne I have the feeling our design is\n&gt; flawed. Are there any suggesstions or =\r\ncourse of actions for this case?\n&gt;\n&gt; I hope I made myself clear,\n&gt;\n&gt; Best r=\r\negards!\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
