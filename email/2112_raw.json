If it is\n&gt; interesting to know how\n&gt; &gt;many test cases the system has passed, then it is also\n&gt; interesting to know how many\n&gt; &gt;asserts have made it. This is especially true if a test case is\n&gt; something like testMethod(),\n&gt; &gt;where the individual asserts verify that various values of the\n&gt; parameters to method()\n&gt; &gt;work (max, min, null, normal, etc). Sure these could all be\n&gt; individual test cases, but then\n&gt; &gt;it becomes difficult to see whether I really have exhaustively\n&gt; tested my method. Code\n&gt; &gt;coverage is not the solution. That only tells me whether what I\n&gt; have written, opposed to\n&gt; &gt;what I should have written, works.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; Vladimir Bossicard wrote:\n&gt; Ok imagine JUnit implements the counting of assertions.  You run your\n&gt; tests and get &quot;90 tests, 405 assertions&quot;.  That&#39;s great, but what does\n&gt; this number &quot;405&quot; tells you?  And what is that better than &quot;90 tests,\n&gt; 404 assertions&quot; and worst than &quot;90 tests, 406 assertions&quot;?  Does this\n&gt; magic number &quot;405&quot; tell you that the &quot;individual asserts verify that\n&gt; various values of the parameters to method() work (max, min, null,\n&gt; normal, etc)&quot;.  Do you expect a certain ration #assertions/#tests?\n&gt;\n&gt; How does this magic &quot;405&quot; tells you that you have tested what you\n&gt; _should have_ written?  I you don&#39;t know what you should have written, I\n&gt; doubt that a simple number could tell you that...\n&gt;\n\n&quot;90 tests, 405 assertions&quot; doesn&#39;t tell me much, however seeing something\nlike &quot;90 tests, 0 assertions&quot; should raise a red flag in anyone&#39;s eyes. This\nsort of thing does happen and needs to be highlighted.\n\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\nMike Silverstein\nSilverMark, Inc.\nThe object testing company\nhttp://www.silvermark.com\n\n\n",
