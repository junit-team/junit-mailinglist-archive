But it&#39;s suffering to\n&gt; write JUnit cases. Because:\n\n&gt; 1. I need to know the correct result from the other way around and sometimes\n&gt; it&#39;s hard to find another way.\n\nI understand, but if you don&#39;t know the correct result before you write \nthe code, then how do you know if you&#39;re writing the code correctly?\n\n&gt; 2. Database and JSP pages are difficult to JUnit test.\n\nYes, they are.\n\n&gt; 3. Mock objects brings more than double efforts during the whole develop\n&gt; process.\n\nCompared to what?\n\n&gt; 4. Exception situation is not so easy to make as JUnit claims.\n\nCan you give us an example, because I find it quite easy.\n\n&gt; 3 friends in 3 different companies (small size and middle size company)\n&gt; complain JUnit as:\n\n&gt; 1. They planned JUnit testing firstly and they cannot keep it going. TIME\n&gt; reason?\n\nIf you do not need to do it correctly, then don&#39;t write tests. For \ndecades, programmers have pretended that writing correct code is not \npart of their job. They are wrong, and have always been wrong.\n\n&gt; 2. It consumes a lot of time but hard to find big problems. JUnit does find\n&gt; small problems as we expected.\n\nI find this interesting: but finding all the small problems, there are \nvery few big problems.\n\nhttp://c2.com/cgi/wiki?RidiculousSimplicityGivesRidiculousResources\n\nCan you give us an example of a big problem that programmer testing with \nJUnit didn&#39;t help you/them find?\n\n&gt; 3. JUnit testing is not effcient enough.\n\nIn what way is it not efficient enough? What more of something do you \nexpect to get with the same amount of time?\n\n&gt; 4. Best JUnit tester is the senior software developer. But senior guys hate\n&gt; to write test cases.\n\nSenior guys don&#39;t have the responsibility to write correct code?\n\n&gt; 5. For small company, it&#39;s really hard to choose between JUnit+develop and\n&gt; develop+functional testing.\n\nThere are many small teams (6-8 people) doing /all three/ effectively, \nso perhaps there are some other interesting problems to try to solve there.\n\n&gt; Is there anyone who is successful in deploying JUnit during develop as:\n&gt; JUnit + code + JUnit + code + System Testing?\n\nI&#39;d like to hear stories from other JUnit users, of course.\n-- \nJ.
