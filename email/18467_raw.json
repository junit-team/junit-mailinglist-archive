Could you elaborate?\n\n, and in the end, you&#39;re probably better off simply writing a\n&gt;  method assertButtonIsEnabled(enabled) which, in my opinion, is the most\n&gt;  readable of all.\n&gt;\n\nHow does that scale better?\n\nOne of the problems with assertXxxx(String message, Object expected,\nObject actual). Is that it is not obvious where expected and actual\nshould go. With the precence of a descriptive message and checking\nstrings for equality it can become even funnier. with\nassertThat(Object actual, Expression expression) you simply can&#39;t mix\nthem (unless actual is also an expression).\n\nI&#39;ve noticed that a lot of people have issues with the asserThat\nsyntax and I have never been able to quite figure out why.\n\n",
