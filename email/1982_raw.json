Your point about AT&#39;s\nis well taken.\n\nTo my way of thinking, flawed though it might be, a unit describes one\nscenario of one behavior.  For example, if we&#39;re talking about an ordering\nsystem, a specified product might exist in a number of states, onhand and\nnot committed, on hand but committed, on order (imminent arrival), on order\n(protracted arrival), out of stock at the supplier (undetermined\navailability) or perhaps even never available again.  A customer wanting to\norder that product might have patterned responses for each of these states.\nIf the task at hand is to develop a system that will automate the response\nto a customer placing an order for this item, each possible state and\noutcome combination constitutes a unit.  Each test case contributing its\nbehavioral rules to the design.\n\nOk, I&#39;ve said my bit beat it up.\n\nRegards,\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: Jason Rogers [mailto:jason.rogers@...]\nSent: Tuesday, July 17, 2001 6:57 PM\nTo: &#39;junit@yahoogroups.com&#39;\nSubject: RE: [junit] Why doesn&#39;t JUnit count asserts?\n\n\nI don&#39;t think that was the point.  The point was that Matthew (& co.) are\nusing JUnit for both UTs and ATs (FTs).  JUnit is actually very good for\nsome types of ATs because it is such a well designed automated testing\nframework.  They aren&#39;t violating any premises, for as Matthew said they are\nusing it for UTs in the way it was meant.  But, if it happens to work for\ntheir ATs, why not use it?\n\nIf you would still like to get into the debate of what is a &quot;UNIT&quot; though,\nfeel free.\n\n-Jason\n\n\nTo unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\njunit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n\n\nYour use of Yahoo!
