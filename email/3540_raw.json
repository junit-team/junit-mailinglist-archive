Any test case writer who needs access to the\ndata dir always knows he can find it by System.getProperty(&quot;test.data.dir&quot;).\n\nThat works for us.  Then under the test-data dir, which is in source control\nwith the source but not mixed in with the source, we have a directory\nstructure matching the top-levels of the package structure of the code we&#39;re\ntesting.  Not the whole structure is reflected -- just what&#39;s needed to\ndistinguish say the jrun.deployment test data from the jrun.ejb.persistence\ntests, etc.\n\nGenerally, the way many applications get around this problem is to establish\na default conventional location for the directory to load data from, and\nthen use a system or application level property (registry setting, etc.) to\nmake it easily customizable.  For example:\n\nWeb-apps:\nWEB-INF/classes\nWEB-INF/lib\n\nJVM:\n$JDK_HOME/jre/lib/ext\n\nApache:\nhtdocs/\ncgi-bin/\n\nIIS:\nwwwroot/\nscripts/\n\netc.\n\nScott Stirling\nJRun QA\nMacromedia\n\n&gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; From: Cormac Mullally [mailto:Cormac.Mullally@...]\n&gt; \n&gt; Hi all,\n&gt; This question is about making your junit test&#39;s extremely reusable, i\n&gt; want my tests to run even if my code is down loaded by \n&gt; someone else and\n&gt; this means i want to avoid hard coding in locations.\n&gt; I am currently working on a system which uses a SAX parser, \n&gt; to test it I\n&gt; need access to the file system to get the xml files but i \n&gt; don&#39;t want to\n&gt; hard code in the dir.  I have looked a lot of places for the \n&gt; answer, and\n&gt; i can&#39;t find a solution to my problem.  I have read the Junit best\n&gt; practices article (It deals with this issue) but it doesn&#39;t answer my\n&gt; specific question.  I want to get access to a directory? Has \n&gt; anyone come\n&gt; across this problem?\n&gt; Does anyone have any advice or ideas on where to look?\n&gt; Cheer&#39;s,\n&gt; Cormac\n\n",
