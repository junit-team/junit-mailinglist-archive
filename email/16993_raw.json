I needed\n&gt; to write some tests around a user belonging to a group.\n&gt;  \n&gt; I needed at a minimum an implementation of IDfUser and IDfGroup. Due to the\n&gt; nature of the beast it is most common to get these from the session\n&gt; (IDfSession). As all of these are interfaces it wasn&#39;t too bad but each of\n&gt; the interfaces extends others and have several hundred methods each. I\n&gt; eventually decided that what I was trying to test in this case was\n&gt; Documentum logic and that I should just trust the framework.\n&gt;   \nOne quick point: a major appeal of JMock, and the other mocking \nframeworks, as far as I know, is that the number of methods or \nsuperinterfaces of an interface does not affect the complexity of the \ntest, just the number of methods used.  However, I also agree that you \nshouldn&#39;t test the framework, just your own code, as much as possible.  \nThanks for the clarification,\n\n    David Saff\n\n",
