There has been a lot of discussion of 100<br/>\n&gt; errors &#39;suddenly&#39; showing up, and most seem to think this to<br/>\n&gt; be a rare thing,...which led me and others to question the<br/>\n&gt; size of the development group or code base. So, my first<br/>\n&gt; question, is what is a &#39;development team size&#39; threshhold for<br/>\n&gt; meaningful Unit Testing?  At what point do you think there<br/>\n&gt; are too many cooks in the kitchen,...or is there no<br/>\n&gt; threshhold, assuming that your team sticks to the tenets of<br/>\n&gt; TDD/XP/Agile/&#39;general good coding practices&#39;?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Jutta Eckstein, who is experienced in team sizes around a hundred of<br/>\ndevelopers, is known for saying that *especiall* for larger teams she finds<br/>\nAgile practices to be vital. I haven&#39;t read her book yet, but it seems to<br/>\nalso contain some advice on testing:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.jeckstein.de/agilebook/index.html\">http://www.jeckstein.de/agilebook/index.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Additionally,<br/>\n&gt; my team has been struggling with maintaining our tests at<br/>\n&gt; green bar, so my second question is what is a &#39;code size<br/>\n&gt; (number of classes)&#39; threshhold for meaningful Unit Testing?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>The larger the code base, the more important automated focussed tests seem<br/>\nto be to me.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; We have upwards of 10 developers working on ~1500 classes.<br/>\n&gt; Our tests are a pain to maintain<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>What specific pain(s) are you experiencing? Can you give examples? Why do<br/>\nyou think it has something to do with the size of the project?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; - takes too long to run<br/>\n&gt; completely in Eclipse before checking in;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>There are too solutions here:<br/>\n<br/>\n- don&#39;t always run them all,<br/>\n- speed them up<br/>\n<br/>\nNot having them doesn&#39;t look like a valid option to me, unless the system<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t have to work (which would make me wonder why you develop it at all).<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; takes ~6 hours to run<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Why are they taking that long?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; and report the nightlybuild (includes coverage testing);<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>How much time is coverage testing consuming? What value does it have for<br/>\nyou?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; we&#39;re nowhere near green bar, so recognizing when there is<br/>\n&gt; something new (from yesterday) is near impossible, and<br/>\n&gt; possibly impractical (in a 40 hour work week). I&#39;m not<br/>\n&gt; necessarily looking for any answers,...but maybe someone has<br/>\n&gt; some insight - has been there before - or will just commisserate with<br/>\n&gt; me.  :) <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>We have around half a million lines of code (don&#39;t know the number of<br/>\nclasses), but only 4500 unit tests (it&#39;s legacy code, we are adding tests<br/>\nslowly). The full test suite takes several minutes to run, a full build<br/>\nroughly an hour. The full build is executed continuously by a Cruise Control<br/>\nserver.<br/>\n<br/>\nBefore committing, I typically run only the suites of modules I have changes<br/>\nin (the code is distributed over 80+ modules). The suite for a module<br/>\ntypically only takes a couple of seconds to run. (I hope the continuous<br/>\ntesting plugin will soon work with the lates stable build of Eclipse again.)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe tests that take the most amount of time are those for parsing XML. I<br/>\nguess if it would become a problem, we probably could improve those.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope this helps giving you some context and ideas...<br/>\n<br/>\nTake care, Ilja</div>",
