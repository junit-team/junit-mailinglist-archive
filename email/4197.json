I would be a lot more convinced of the use of tests as a sole documentary<br/>\nagent if it were easy to use a tool to automatically jump to the appropriate<br/>\ntest for a method from the source code.<br/>\n<br/>\nSeems to me that tests tend to evolve quite quickly and (maybe it&#39;s just me)<br/>\nhaphazardly. One of the reasons I think that JUnit is so useful is that it<br/>\nis very light-weight. If its usage was altered to structure it more, the<br/>\nsame problems with syncing with the code would happen as with integrated<br/>\n(javadoc) comments. <br/>\n<br/>\nJust my tuppence worth.<br/>\n<br/>\n -----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: \tMike Clark [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mike@...\">mike@...</a>] <br/>\nSent:\t22 February 2002 15:26<br/>\nTo:\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject:\tRe: [junit] Re: JavaDocs<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Heath, Joseph&quot; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; Then I&#39;ll leave you with this final thought:  If we design<br/>\n&gt; &gt; software by writing tests first, do the tests document the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; intention of the software, or its implementation?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; But this assumes that our tests cover all possibilities of use, which can<br/>\n&gt; result in large test suites. I am not against this (in fact I prefer it),<br/>\n&gt; but often a few words of English (or whatever language you read) is<br/>\n&gt; preferrable (IMHO) to a large test suite.<br/>\n&gt; I still have the test suite, however, for refactoring and code proof.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>If we don&#39;t write new code until we have a failing test, then the tests<br/>\ncover all the methods.  I agree that they may not test all possible<br/>\nparameters.  We&#39;ll maximize the testing investment by testing interesting<br/>\nboundary conditions and reasonable ranges for parameters.  Our code coverage<br/>\nwill still be very high.  And yes, we&#39;ll amass test suites quickly as our<br/>\ntests become more comprehensive over time.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf a few words of English is necessary over and above the method signature,<br/>\nthen by all means add it to the documentation.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; I would still say that that the tests document examples of the intention,<br/>\n&gt; rather than the intention itself. These examples may be a complete set or<br/>\n&gt; may not be, often just the critical subset.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Agreed.  Examples of intention and intention draw closer together the more<br/>\nwe use test-first design.  Nevertheless, we&#39;re documenting intention rather<br/>\nthan implementation.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood points - thanks!<br/>\n<br/>\nMike<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nMike Clark<br/>\nClarkware Consulting, Inc.<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.clarkware.com\">http://www.clarkware.com</a><br/>\n720.851.2014<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nTo unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\">junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nYour use of Yahoo!
