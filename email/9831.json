The idea is that it <br/>\n&gt; should then be possible identify when code changes occurred that caused a <br/>\n&gt; significant drop in performance.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; thanks<br/>\n&gt; Nathan<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You could probably do this if you wrote a custom TestRunner.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you know Aspect-Oriented Programming, this also seems like a good use for it. <br/>\n  It would be fairly simple to write an aspect which reported elapsed execution <br/>\ntime on a per-test-method level.
