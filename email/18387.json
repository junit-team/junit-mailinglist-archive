That was the model that built some big software<br/>\n&gt; tool companies (Rational, etc.), but it isn&#39;t working well any more. I don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; have the answer--it depends on what people and companies are willing to pay<br/>\n&gt; for--but there needs to be some way to return a profit from investment in<br/>\n&gt; software tools. Per-class licensing is intended to make quick, small-scale<br/>\n&gt; use of tools inexpensive, but it doesn&#39;t seem to scale well. Over the long<br/>\n&gt; run I think service models based on proprietary software (a la<br/>\n&gt; Salesforce.com) will become more common, but it&#39;s hard to see how to apply<br/>\n&gt; that to software tools at the moment.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I think I understand the antiquated licence scheme it&#39;s meant to <br/>\nreplace, but I would rather pay a tiered subscription fee based on a <br/>\nmeasure of how much I use the software (say, the number of outcomes it <br/>\ndetects?), rather than what the resulting design looks like.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Anyway, objection noted. Thanks.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You&#39;re welcome, and thank you for noting it. I know it&#39;s a knotty <br/>\nproblem to solve. I can&#39;t claim to know better, but I know what I don&#39;t <br/>\nlike, and I don&#39;t like this (quite). Of course, I&#39;m not exactly in <br/>\nAgitar&#39;s market for this product right now, so my opinion is largely <br/>\ntheoretical in nature at present.<br/>\n<br/>\nTake care.<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJ.
