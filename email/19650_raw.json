However, rather than simply copy one of\n&gt; the models out there we&#39;re going to go back to first principles and try to\n&gt; derive a model for classification that is concise, useful, flexible, and,\n&gt; above all, easy to use.\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;ve heard two purposes for classification:\n&gt; * Performance\n&gt; * Assumptions\n\nFor me classification gives me the ability to do appropriate slicing\nand dicing of my tests to:\n* maximize the information the tests can provide to me\n* maximize my ability to manage risk in flexible ways\n\nIf I can slice my tests into unit, integration, acceptance etc and\ncheck what code coverage each return, that tells me a lot more than\njust an aggregate. A project with 100% coverage aggregate but with\n10% coverage coming from unit, and 10% from integration and the\nrest from acceptance will be vastly different from one that has\n100% from unit and none for the others and different too to one that\nhas 100% coverage for all three.\n\nAs an aside, I have seen large projects with 100% unit coverage and\n100% acceptance test coverage but never one with 100% integration \nlevel coverage - but you&#39;ll understand what I mean. Also, I used 100%\ncoverage in the above example but that was just an example - I don&#39;t\nadvocate 100% line or branch coverage as a magical metric we should\nnecessarily be striving for above all else.\n\nI can do some classification with naming conventions but having arbitrary\ngroups provides more flexibility. I don&#39;t think you need to go over\nboard here though, I don&#39;t need really fined grained flexibility here.\nIf you want that you are better off looking at what Clover 2 or Agitar\ndashboard do by bringing other measures of risk into the picture.\n\nThe same applies for CI systems. If I can slice and dice my tests, then\nI can better manage risk. I may run all my fast tests and a selection\nof very targeted acceptance and integration tests on every check in.\nI may run a broader set of tests for high-risk areas several times a day.\nI may run a complete regression suite nightly.\n\nI don&#39;t see having the ability to slice and dice the test suites in\nflexible ways as a hack but as a management tool that allows me to weigh\nup fast feedback cycles vs risk vs available hardware resources.\n\nCheers, Paul.\n\n\n\n",
