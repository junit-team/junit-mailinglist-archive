Rainsberger [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jbrains@...\">jbrains@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Saturday, November 15, 2003 8:20 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [junit] Reg:Help on JUnit with HashTable and other issues<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nNagarajan, Naveen (Cognizant) wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; hi,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I have the following queries.Pls answer them.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; A.Pls take a look at the following class :<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; class XYZ{<br/>\n&gt; public Hashtable stvalues(){<br/>\n&gt; //this method hits the database and retrives a set of values<br/>\n&gt; // lets says a persons name,address,salary and computes some values on <br/>\n&gt; the salary<br/>\n&gt; }<br/>\n&gt; }<br/>\n&gt; assuming i have imported the required packages.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; class TestXYZ extends TestCase{<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; public void teststvalues(){<br/>\n&gt; //test code<br/>\n&gt; }<br/>\n&gt; }<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The only way i can test the method is to create a Hashtable object with <br/>\n&gt; the expected data and compare it with actual data.<br/>\n&gt; but the expected values for the hashtable depends(indirectly) upon the <br/>\n&gt; state of database (the values in the table person).<br/>\n&gt; Also i need to build a hashtable object with all the values(which could <br/>\n&gt; run into say some 100 rows.if i am having 100 rows ,i need to check the <br/>\n&gt; all the 100 rows instead of a sample 2 rows of test data .) in my <br/>\n&gt; database which is tedious.and while building the object,the test may <br/>\n&gt; also become invalid because the database state may change in time and <br/>\n&gt; the fixture may become invalid.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Use DBUnit to set up the data and a separate test database for testing. <br/>\nDo not share your test database with anyone. This is one method you <br/>\n/want/ to test against a live database, because you are testing your <br/>\nability to read data and map it. Just make sure you have exclusive <br/>\naccess to the database.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you find yourself wanting to do this in more than (say) three places, <br/>\nthen come back for more advice, because my answer will change.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;snip /&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; B.Also i am using Junit to test certain functions of session beans ?<br/>\n&gt; am using a combination of the  InitialContext object <br/>\n&gt; ,javax.rmi.PortableRemoteObject.narrow method,create() method of my <br/>\n&gt; interface which extends EJBHome to create an instance of the object <br/>\n&gt; required and then testing the functions .<br/>\n&gt; Am not sure whether this an valid approach.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It&#39;s a valid approach if it works.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Is there any other better approach ?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Are you testing your session bean logic? If so, extract it to a separate <br/>\nclass and test it in memory. Make the session bean Too Simple to Break <br/>\nby having it do nothing but delegate to the session bean logic class. <br/>\nUse MockEJB to test the session bean.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; C. Can Junit be used to test getter methods which have some DB hits and <br/>\n&gt; some logic in it ?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>JUnit can test anything to which a Java interface is available.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;     Is it in conformance with Junit philosophy ?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Is it in conformance with the philosophy of Good Design?
