If you \n&gt; find an answer, please describe your answer along with your question.\n&gt; \n&gt; Although we are here to help people learn to use JUnit \n&gt; effectively, we are not here to be pro bono consultants.\n&gt; \n&gt; It&#39;s just a question of common courtesy.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; J.
