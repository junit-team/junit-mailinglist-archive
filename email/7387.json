Does it really<br/>\ntake every possible string? I&#39;m thinking there is probably some<br/>\nsmaller set of cases that would provide &#39;reasonable&#39; confidence.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, you don&#39;t just have to use assertEquals.<br/>\nWhat about an assertTrue (or assertFalse) based on &#39;A&#39; or &#39;a&#39;<br/>\nexisting in the string after the trimA() call?<br/>\nWhat about counting the number of &#39;A&#39; and &#39;a&#39; instances BEFORE,<br/>\nand making sure the trimmed string is that many characters LESS<br/>\nin length?<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd of course, if the input is ONLY A&#39;s and a&#39;s, do you get<br/>\na NULL or an empty string?<br/>\n<br/>\nI think there are lots of things that can reasonably be tested<br/>\nwith only a few tests on a representative sample.<br/>\n<br/>\nRichard.</div>",
