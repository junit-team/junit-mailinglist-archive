For \nexample, if I have a bunch of code that uses one single global \ndatabase accessed as a singleton, I may want to set up the database \nonce for all my tests. If I force myself to think carefully about the \nvisibility of the database, I find that I can restrict access to it \nto a few objects. If I just use TestSetup, I miss the chance to think \ncarefully.\n\nKent\n\n--- In junit@y..., noer2b@y... wrote:\n&gt; Kent: are you saying the design problem is typically with the \ntests, \n&gt; the unit under test, or both?\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In junit@y..., kentbeck@c... wrote:\n&gt; &gt; When I feel like sharing setup between tests, I usually have a \n&gt; design \n&gt; &gt; problem that deserves attention.
