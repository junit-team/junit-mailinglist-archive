We have this fairly well covered already and we manage to capture everything that happens within a given test-case for that test-case.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe real problem is that the RunListener API does not demarcate test-classes properly, so I am unable to distinguish console output happening in @AfterClass of one test with @BeforeClass on the test-class on the same thread.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis problem has been in the corner of my eye for quite some time and I&#39;ve been trying to find a decent angle to solve it from. I promise not to do anything that is frowned upon, which is why I asked ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nKristian<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a>, Matthew Farwell &lt;matthew@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Kristian,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; In reading your original mail, I was also confused as to what you wanted to<br/>\n&gt; achieve.

It works for simple cases but with customized<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Runner-classes and new JUnit-features (e.g. the introduction of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; JUnit-Rules) the result is usually bad and it discourages the IDE users<br/>\n&gt; &gt; (i.e. the developers) from taking full advantage of JUnit!<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; However, Maven (versions 2.0-2.2) and its Surefire-plugin has handled the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; JUnit-integration wonderfully, as far as I know, so your post worries me a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; little. What is it that you want to accomplish by moving away from the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; successful(!) &quot;Junitcore+RunListener based approach&quot;?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Henrik<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a>, kristian@ wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Hi,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I maintain the junit provider for maven-surefire, and I&#39;m looking into<br/>\n&gt; &gt; transitioning from a Junitcore+RunListener based approach to an approach<br/>\n&gt; &gt; based on something like BlockJUnit4ClassRunner.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Unfortunately I cannot subclass the BlockJUnit4ClassRunner since the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; client code itself may need to do that, so I&#39;d somehow need to put &quot;my&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Runner in front of the client-supplied one, maybe something proxy like.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Anyone have any tips on this, maybe some existing code that does this ?<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Kristian<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  <br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>",
