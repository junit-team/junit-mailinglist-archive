Fo=\r\nr a minute I was feeling isolated and out of \nsynch. with the community.  :=\r\n-)\n\n&gt; Since we&#39;re talking stylistic issues here, I would point out that \n@I=\r\ngnore is\n&gt; a very poor choice for this purpose, since it doesn&#39;t say much \n=\r\nabout &quot;ignore\n&gt; what?&quot;.  Or, in this case, &quot;ignored by what?&quot;.\n&gt; \n&gt; The equ=\r\nivalent in TestNG is an attribute:  @Test(enabled =3D false), \nwhich\n&gt; make=\r\ns more sense in my opinion.  An even better choice is to put \nthe method\n&gt; =\r\nin an ignored group (@Test(groups =3D {&quot;ignored&quot;}) and then exclude \nthat g=\r\nroup\n&gt; from your runs.  The benefit of this approach is that the HTML \nrepo=\r\nrts list\n&gt; all the groups that have been included and excluded, so it&#39;s ver=\r\ny \neasy to\n&gt; get a quick list of all the methods currently being ignored.\n\n=\r\nIn the interest of emphasizing common ground - I also find &quot;@Ignore&quot; \nto be=\r\n a bit non-descript.  For TestUtil we offered two (functionally \nequivalent=\r\n) choices for each (JavaDoc) annotation:\n\n    @excludeClass\n    @excludeCla=\r\nssFromTestUtilVerification\n    @excludeSetter\n    @excludeSetterFromTestUti=\r\nlVerification\n\nThe verbose versions don&#39;t leave much room for interpretatio=\r\nn!\n\n_Marvin\n\n&gt; \n&gt; -- \n&gt; C=E9dric\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message=\r\n have been removed]\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n",
