Sure, my coverage can tell me that a certain part\n&gt;  &gt;of my applicat=\r\nion is tested indirectly, but if I don&#39;t have unit tests for\n&gt;  &gt;them, loca=\r\nting the bug will be harder for me since there will be multiple\n&gt;  &gt;suspect=\r\ns for the location of the bug.\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt;Consider the following example:  I =\r\nhave to display a sorted list in a web\n&gt;  &gt;page, and I only have a function=\r\nal test that verifies that the HTML is\n&gt;  &gt;correct.  My coverage confirms t=\r\nhat my ordering logic is run during the\n&gt;  &gt;tests.  In this situation, the =\r\nordering logic is private and not directly\n&gt;  &gt;tested.\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt;A user repo=\r\nrts that the list is not sorted correctly, and now I find myself\n&gt;  &gt;with a=\r\nt least two possible locations to investigate:  the HTML generation\n&gt;  &gt;and=\r\n the sorting logic.\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt;If I had written a test for the private sortin=\r\ng logic, I would know right\n&gt;  &gt;away where the bug is.\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  True en=\r\nough, but there&#39;s no particular reason why the logic has to be\n&gt;  private. =\r\nI&#39;d be leery of a class that generates HTML and sorts. If the\n&gt;  sort is an=\r\n another class, it can be public and far easier to test.\n\nSure, but that&#39;s =\r\na different side to the story.  I was just responding\nto Bob&#39;s point, which=\r\n was basically saying &quot;as long as I have coverage\nto indicate that my code =\r\nis run, I can skip a few unit tests&quot;.\n\nIt&#39;s true from a functional standpoi=\r\nnt, but as I pointed, you, as a\nprogrammer, do lose some comfort when you r=\r\neplace unit testing with\ncode coverage, since finding bugs will be made mor=\r\ne difficult.\n\n-- \nC=E9dric\nhttp://testng.org\n\n",
