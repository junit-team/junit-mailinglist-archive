In the olden days, with Eclipse\n&gt; 3.0 and JUnit 3.8, I could select a single test method in the Outline\n&gt; view and run just that method.  Nowadays, whenever I try to do that,\n&gt; Eclipse&#39;s test runner runs all the tests in the class.  The results are\n&gt; shown in a tree, and the tests I didn&#39;t ask to be run are all under a\n&gt; node called &quot;Unrooted Tests [Runner: JUnit 4]&quot;.\n&gt; \n&gt; ...\n&gt; \n&gt; Cheers,\n&gt; Todd.\n&gt; ----\n&gt; Todd Bradley - Polycom, Inc.\n&gt; ReadiVideo QA Lead\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\nWell you are certainly not the only person getting this! We have upgraded to\nJunit 4.4 within our project and get the same issue. It makes debugging a\nreal pain. If anyone finds a solution to this problem I would be obliged if\nyou can pass it on!  BTW we are using MyEclipse 6.0.1.\n\nAyub Malik\n-- \nView this message in context: http://www.nabble.com/what%27s-an-%22Unrooted-Test%22-and-why-can%27t-I-find-anything-online-about-it--tp14326290p14578597.html\nSent from the JUnit - User mailing list archive at Nabble.com.\n\n\n",
