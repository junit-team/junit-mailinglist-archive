Therefore well tested public <br/>\n&gt; methods will include the behaviour of the private methods.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; There is no real reason for directly testing private methods.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Domain objects support the GUI. By the logic above a well tested GUI<br/>\nwill include the behavior of the domain objects, so there is no reason<br/>\nto unit test the domain objects :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve occasionally found reason to write unit tests for private,<br/>\nsupporting methods. Often you loose efficiency testing supporting<br/>\nmethods indirectly via their caller - such as in the case where you want<br/>\nto test their ability to properly handle a range of input values. <br/>\n<br/>\nPersonally, I don&#39;t believe in private methods. I&#39;d rather make<br/>\neverything public and testable and expose real APIs via Java Interfaces.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo answer the original poster: google junit + &quot;private methods&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n---<br/>\nOutgoing mail is certified Virus Free.<br/>\nChecked by AVG anti-virus system (http://www.grisoft.com).<br/>\nVersion: 6.0.522 / Virus Database: 320 - Release Date: 9/29/2003</div>",
