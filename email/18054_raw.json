(I had to think about \nthat carefully before I typed it.)\n\nThe bottom line is that I know I go much, much faster when I have tests \ncompared to when I don&#39;t. Exactly how much is not something I can say.\n\n&gt; But to my feeling unit testing can be done at the requirements level.\n\nI think you mean what the community calls &quot;story testing&quot;. You&#39;re \nabsolutely right: you can write tests at that level, and many do. I have \ntried living with tests /only/ at that level, and invariably find myself \nwanting to write object-level tests as well.\n\nTake care.\n-- \nJ. B.
