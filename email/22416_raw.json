We are having a hell of a time getting that working too=\r\n. We have the hub on Ubuntu and windows slaves don&#39;t play nice but Ubuntu s=\r\nlaves work fine. I haven&#39;t found much info on the issues we are seeing nor =\r\nhave a I gotten any responses on the Selenium mailing list.  We may just ha=\r\nve to skip IE testing for now and running everything on firefox Ubuntu.\n\nD/=\r\n\n\nOn Feb 13, 2010, at 4:28 PM, krosenvold wrote:\n\n\n\nI think the thing you&#39;r=\r\ne missing is that maven surefire 2.5 works with JUST junit 4.7+ or a *combi=\r\nnation* of junit 4.7+ /and/ ConfigurableParallelComputer.\n\nWhen using suref=\r\nire with junit /alone/ it does not support threadCount. You will need to us=\r\ne the /combination/ to restrict threadCount. Since you&#39;re a selenium user y=\r\nou WILL need to limit threads, which means you *cannot* get by with just ju=\r\nnit 4.7+, but you *will* need ConfigurableParallelComputer.\n\nI will update =\r\nthe surefire docs to be a bit clearer on this restriction.\n\nI know at least=\r\n three selenium projects that are doing exactly what you want. Most run wit=\r\nh parallel=3Dclasses and a thread restriction, since this allows a smooth n=\r\number of concurrent tests, something that is good for your grid. My current=\r\n firefox runs went from 45 minutes single thread to 8 minutes concurrent, s=\r\no there&#39;s definitely a huge upside.\n\nThis does not mean it&#39;s a simple task,=\r\n since most selenium test suites are not written with concurrency support i=\r\nn mind. Quite frankly, if you think getting surefire/junit to work is hard =\r\nyou can rest assured that the worst part is still ahead of you.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[Non-=\r\ntext portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n",
