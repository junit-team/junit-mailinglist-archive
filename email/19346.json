I am trying out JMock2 at the moment; I can<br/>\ndevelop on Java5 even though the production code gets deployed to Java4.<br/>\n<br/>\nI quite like the API, and apparently from Elliotte&#39;s recent reporting at<br/>\nJavaOne, Builders are expected to become more prevalent!<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.cafeaulait.org/#May_9_2007_46487\">http://www.cafeaulait.org/#May_9_2007_46487</a><br/>\n<br/>\nJMock2 not quite as nice[1] as the previous framework that I used, since the<br/>\nexamples on the site seem to have omitted all the casts that are required.<br/>\n<br/>\ncontext.checking(new Expectations() {{<br/>\n   one (subscriber).receive(message);<br/>\n}});<br/>\n<br/>\nBut in practice with JMock2, it would seem to be:<br/>\n<br/>\ncontext.checking(new Expectations() {{<br/>\n   ((Subscriber) one (subscriber)).receive(message);<br/>\n}});<br/>\n<br/>\nPreviously, I would have had something like:<br/>\n<br/>\nsubscriber.expects.receive(message).once();<br/>\n<br/>\nWhere subscriber isn&#39;t a plain Subscriber reference; it&#39;s a reference to a<br/>\nSubscriberMock generated-class that implements Subscriber, along with some<br/>\nadditional functionality / fields.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut then you don&#39;t have to worry about generating the mock code when you use<br/>\nJMock. YMMV, and that&#39;s a minor point.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also like that JMock2 isn&#39;t invasive, in that we have a lot of JUnit3 test<br/>\ncases and I don&#39;t need to alter the existing inheritance hierarchy. It&#39;ll do<br/>\nfor now until I start to feel some pain and then see whether any of the<br/>\nother solutions available can address that particular pinch point for me.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers,<br/>\n<br/>\nJames<br/>\n<br/>\n[1] I&#39;m using &#39;nice&#39; in the Northern English sense of &quot;I prefer bitter to<br/>\nlager, but it&#39;s not worth worrying about&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn 11/05/07, Alexandru Popescu ☀ &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:the.mindstorm.mailinglist@...\">the.mindstorm.mailinglist@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nwrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;   On 5/11/07, J.

Smalltalkers and Rubyists love it, others hate it. It&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the most creative use of Java I&#39;ve ever seen and if the API fails, I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; blame Java, not JMock.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From their web site:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; context.checking(new Expectations() {{<br/>\n&gt; &gt; one (subscriber).receive(message);<br/>\n&gt; &gt; }});<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; subscriber is the mock object whose expecting receive(message) once. The<br/>\n&gt; &gt; punctuation is ugly, but the words are beautiful. If it were this,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; wouldn&#39;t it be nearly perfect?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; context.checking expectations [<br/>\n&gt; &gt; one: subscriber.receive(message);<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ]<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Probably. And you have presented only the first code line from the<br/>\n&gt; example, which is still unreadable: one(subscriber): does mean in fact<br/>\n&gt; that subscriber will receive ONE message and not what the english<br/>\n&gt; reading of that code implies. And this is clear once you are using the<br/>\n&gt; other methods.<br/>\n&gt; The following lines of the sample are becoming even more readable as<br/>\n&gt; they are completely disconnected from the previous. Comparing this<br/>\n&gt; with:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; expect(myobject.doSomething()).andReturn()<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I still find this last one more readable. But, I have to agree this is<br/>\n&gt; more a matter of taste, and so I will not argue on (in fact I said it<br/>\n&gt; from the beginning that my ranking is a matter of taste and experience<br/>\n&gt; with these frameworks and not something I am absolute about).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; bests,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ./alex<br/>\n&gt; --<br/>\n&gt; .w( the_mindstorm )p.<br/>\n&gt; TestNG co-founder<br/>\n&gt; EclipseTestNG Creator<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; --<br/>\n&gt; &gt; J.
