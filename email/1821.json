    "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1550769204\"><blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">&gt; &gt;One of the disadvantages to this is that it makes it a <br/>\n    &gt; little harder to<br/>\n    &gt; have<br/>\n    &gt; &gt;that solitary project that will be responsible to run <br/>\n    &gt; all tests, not<br/>\n    &gt; &gt;impossible by any means, it just takes more doing.<br/>\n    &gt; <br/>\n    &gt; I&#39;m not sure I understand your point. Can you explain?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>A difference of style here.  We have all of our individual tests compiled<br/>\ninto some TestSuite.  We then include all of those test suites into the<br/>\nAllTests package in the AllTests project.  Our buildSuite() method becomes<br/>\njust a few lines of code, referencing all of the other project suites (whose<br/>\nbuildSuite() methods are also short and sweet, including only the classes<br/>\nfor that package).  But it seems you have stepped around this by<br/>\nprogrammatically loading every test case in the workspace.  Do you also load<br/>\nthe JUnit test cases (e.g. MoneyTest)?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">     &gt; I  use the VAJ toolapi to extract automatically all tests <br/>\n    &gt; to be run (see<br/>\n    &gt; below code. Not perfect code, but it&#39;s TSTTCPW). They can <br/>\n    &gt; easily be packaged<br/>\n    &gt; in another JAR if needed (with ant for example).<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>How do you do this outside of VAJ using the Tools API?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">     &gt; collectTests() will find every TestCase subclass in the <br/>\n    &gt; workspace. I have a<br/>\n    &gt; ant script that loads the latest release stuff before <br/>\n    &gt; running this.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>When you say &quot;loads&quot;, you mean it loads into VAJ?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">     &gt; Those running the tests still need the code to be tested <br/>\n    &gt; anyway. One other<br/>\n    &gt; point for this way of having tests in the same <br/>\n    &gt; package/project that I didn&#39;t<br/>\n    &gt; mention is that it&#39;s very easy to keep versions in sync <br/>\n    &gt; (tests & code). If<br/>\n    &gt; you have two projects, you can end up runnning old tests <br/>\n    &gt; on newer classes,<br/>\n    &gt; etc..<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>We don&#39;t encounter this problem since the tests projects map one-to-one with<br/>\nthe production code projects, as well as the packages within them.  I guess<br/>\nI dont&#39; quite comprehend how this could happen.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for your thoughts!<br/>\n<br/>\n-Jason</div>",
