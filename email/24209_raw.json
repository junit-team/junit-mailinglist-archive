With this feature many nice ways to do thing =\r\nbecome possible. Therefore I am wondering if other people agree that it mig=\r\nht be time for a JUnit5 putting this new feature to good use.\n&gt; \n&gt; A source=\r\n for inspiration for me in this regard are the FunSuite of ScalaTest http:/=\r\n/www.scalatest.org/getting_started_with_fun_suite\n&gt; \n&gt; There a test definit=\r\nion is a method call (instead of a method definition in JUnit) that registe=\r\nrs a test for execution. It looks roughly like this:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; class MyTestCl=\r\nass{\n&gt; \n&gt;     test(&quot;The test name&quot;){\n&gt;         // the actual test goes here=\r\n \n&gt;     }\n&gt; }\n&gt; \n&gt; With this approach things like Rules become extremly tri=\r\nvial, since all you have to do is wrap the code block (i.e. closure) in a n=\r\new new code block. \n&gt; \n&gt; Also parameterized test become fairly easy, becaus=\r\ne you would just put the call to test in a loop.\n&gt; \n&gt; What do you think? Is=\r\n this an interesting direction for JUnit to go?\n&gt; \n&gt; kind regards \n&gt; Jens\n&gt;=\r\n\n\n\n\n",
