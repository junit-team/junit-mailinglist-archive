Class A is really simple: a constructor with a number of \n&gt;&gt; arguments and a host of accessor methods for retrieving this \n&gt;&gt; (member) data.\n\n&gt; This sounds like a data class... why does it exist if it has no behaviour?\n\nIt exists because I did not want duplicate code within B, so I extraced the\ncommon code out (which seemed reasonable to me at the time).  Also because\nthese little A objects are used elsewhere it made sense for them not to be\nin the transport data type which only has a single specific purpose (to\nserialise data off the wire).\n\nAlso we have a lot of code built to an inhouse protocol talking to an\ninhouse server.  The current chosen method of doing this (and I&#39;m not here\nto debate the rights and wrongs of that method) is via serialisation of\nprotocol data types across the wire.  My application code cares not how\nthese things are created, but that it can use them as it wishes (usually to\nconstruct it&#39;s own model of how it sees the world).\n\n&gt; This is something that&#39;s been really pissing me off about Java..\n&gt; institutionalization of crappy design practices.\n\nThank you for your polite phrasing - I simply have to play with what I am\ngiven.  Please don;t get carried away with my use of the words Java Beans, I\nused them in this context because it explained the &quot;simplicity&quot; of the\nclasses in question rather nicely.  My actual question/query has nothing to\ndo with Java Beans or their use.  \n\nMy question was about interdependencies within classes being tested.  Being\n(still) reasonably new to this area I thought it was worth clarification,\nespecially when a lot of posts on this list (and within various TDD/Unit\nTesting stuff I&#39;ve read) talk alot about mocking out components so the\nbehaviours under test become more self contained.\n\nIn my original question, I have (in my example) two classes on totally self\ncontained and can be tested/re-implemented ad infinitum in its own little\nworld.  My query comes about when I want to test/develop the other class\nthat contains an instance of the former.  Now my second class (B) is\ninextrably coupled to (A) so I was questioning whether anybody (with more\nexperience than I) had any suggestions about how to remove this dependency,\nor whether I was/am worrying about it too much.\n\nIn my current scenario the dependency is not such an issue, however Iwould\nlike to pick up good practices so that when I come to a more complex version\nof the same problem I can then make an informed judgement as to what to do.\n\n&gt;&gt; here comes the dependency.  Class B contains a number of (two) class\n&gt;&gt; A instances.  The raw data is read within readExternal and then used\n&gt;&gt; to construct the instances of A.  Class B provides a couple of \n&gt;&gt; accessors to retrieve those A instances.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Within my unit test for B&#39;s Externalizable implementation is to \n&gt;&gt; check that what I pass in on the InputStream results in the B \n&gt;&gt; instance I expect.  But B contains two As so I appear to have two \n&gt;&gt; points of failure:  A.equals might fail which would result in the \n&gt;&gt; tests for both A and B failing.\n\n&gt; I don&#39;t see a problem.  You have tests for A.  You have tests for B. \n&gt; The fact that B involves A is a non issue.  If A breaks, it&#39;s tests\n&gt; will fail... and yes, so will B&#39;s.. so what.  If A&#39;s tests fail, that\n&gt; indicates that A is broken... don&#39;t worry that B&#39;s tests will fail\n&gt; since A is broken... go fix A.  All the tests should pass again.\n\nAs outlined previously - I have no &quot;problem&quot;, I have tests for both class A\nand class B, I was simply quering whether the dependency was sensible.  I\ndon&#39;t spend much time worrying about whether B fails as a consequence of A.\n\nThank you for your time\nJonathan\n\n",
