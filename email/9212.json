For<br/>\n&gt; example having<br/>\n&gt; a detailed log of the invoked methods (with parameters) should enable<br/>\n&gt; you to reproduce what happened.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>To my knowledge, Exploratory Testing is performed at the GUI level, so<br/>\nthe tester would have to log widget events. Anyway, I once proposed this<br/>\nexact thing to some ET proponents.
