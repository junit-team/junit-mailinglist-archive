What would be the benefit of integrat=\r\ning Junit with test tool. I am using silk central and found that we could a=\r\nlso integrate Junit. But just wondering the benefit out of this.\n\nThanks in=\r\n advance,\nRudra\n\n--- In junit@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Gaurav Pandey&quot; &lt;gaurav_dell=\r\n@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; From the HP Website, http://h20229.www2.hp.com/partner/isv=\r\n/Arsin_prod1.jsp\n&gt; \n&gt; I found that Effecta Integration Framework by Arsin C=\r\norporation may be used for JUNIT integration. \n&gt; \n&gt; Unfortunaly, I am not a=\r\nble to find any documentation which tells me how to achieve this?\n&gt; \n&gt; Any =\r\npointers? \n&gt; \n&gt; Regards\n&gt; Gaurav Pandey\n&gt; www.WhatIsTesting.com \n&gt; \n&gt; --- I=\r\nn junit@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Gaurav Pandey&quot; &lt;gaurav_dell@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Hi\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I am a software tester with no experience with JUnit however, I thi=\r\nnk I know my way around HPQC. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; For one of the projects, the develo=\r\npment team is using JUnit to prepare test cases, however as a process, I ha=\r\nve been asked to find out if JUnit and HPQC are compatible.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I woul=\r\nd request any suggestions/pointers/Challenges/best practices which would as=\r\nsist me in understanding the compatibility. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I also have some ques=\r\ntions which I was not able to figure out?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 1. Is JUnit a unit testi=\r\nng tool? or is it a testing management tool in which we store test cases an=\r\nd test execution results\n&gt; &gt; 2. I have download Junit from the http://www.j=\r\nunit.org/, however I have not been able to &quot;load&quot; the tool. I am not sure o=\r\nn which file to execute? I am running on Windows XP SP2. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I unders=\r\ntand that these might be newbie questions, however any pointers you might p=\r\nrovide me would be very appericated\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n",
