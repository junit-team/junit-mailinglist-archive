It will also <br/>\nwarn you if you have &#39;void testXXXX()&#39; methods that are not public.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf this is not what you want...<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, if you want to have TestCase classes with no test methods, <br/>\nbecause they&#39;re all disabled for example, then add an artifical test <br/>\nmethod that does nothing but successfully return.  This will prevent <br/>\nJUnit from complaining.  (This is a bad thing to do, but I&#39;ve been <br/>\nknown to do it, from time to time.)<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you want to use some other naming standard for test methods (and <br/>\nlord knows why you would want to do that), declare a &#39;public static <br/>\nTest suite()&#39; method in your TestCase, and build your own TestSuite.  <br/>\nSearch for &quot;Parameterized Test Case&quot; for suggestions.</div>",
