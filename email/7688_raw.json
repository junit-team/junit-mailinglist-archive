Testing our persistence\nlayer is slow because we&#39;re actually testing that it properly reads and\nwrites to the database. Very slow. So slow that we tend to avoid running the\ntests, which can be painful later.\n\nTesting layers above the peristence layers is fast because we mocked out the\npersistence layer. Those tests get run a lot and we can be sure that any\nfailures in these tests are not the fault of the persistence layer. Before\nwe mocked out the persistence layer, database access bugs had a large and\nalarming ripple effect. One code change could cause dozens of seemingly\nunrelated tests to fail.\n\nWe don&#39;t have individual databases, we share a test database. Imagine what\nhappens when two people run the same test at the same time against the same\ndatabase. If your tests aren&#39;t really careful about what data they delete,\nyou&#39;re going to have a lot of frustration.\n\nWe still run functional tests that exercise the complete system. There&#39;s\nalways the odd case where the code does exactly what it&#39;s supposed to do but\nnot what somebody else is expecting.\n\nTerry Wilcox\nterry.wilcox@...\n\n&gt; He wants to include two methods in the JUnit tests: makeTestData() \n&gt; and deleteTestData(). The first method would be called before the \n&gt; testing is started. The second method he wants to call after testing \n&gt; is finished.\n&gt; \n&gt; What he wants is to do in makeTestData() is to write test data into \n&gt; the database for testing purposes. So he thinks we don&#39;t need Mock \n&gt; objects.\n\n",
