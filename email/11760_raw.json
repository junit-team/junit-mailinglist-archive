I would rewrite the private methods to \nbe more amenable to testing. It seems to me that in your case you have \naccess to the source else you would not be able to test those methods no \nmatter what ... if you just had access to the class files.\n\nGoing against my better judgement here&#39;s a nice sloppy solution (you \nhave been forewarned !!). Now assuming you have the source and you are \nabsolutely dead against modifying those private methods, but don&#39;t mind \nadding a few extra public methods. Then you could write a public \naccessor function (gasp) for each private method you needed to test, \nthat would return the array object after the private method did it&#39;s \nwork. That way you could compare the state of the array before and after \neach invocation and see if the desired state was achieved. You could put \nall these public accessor functions into an inner class, and then drop \nthe compiled inner class when you are ready to release your class.\n\nSo if your class is Something.java and you have an inner class Test. You \ncan delete the Something$Test.class &lt;ensure that no other function \nwithin class Something depends on the inner Test class&gt;.\n\nPlease note if you can refactor your private methods, then do that  by \nall means\n\n-george\n\n\nrajeshwari_83 wrote:\n\n&gt; There is a class which has one public method returning an ArrayList.\n&gt; The public method of this class inturn calls several private methods\n&gt; which are void. These private methods only keep adding to the\n&gt; arraylist which is finally returned by the public method. I need to\n&gt; write a JUNIT for this class specifically the private methods of this\n&gt; class. Since these methods are void, how do I write JUNIT test cases\n&gt; for them???\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; *Yahoo!
