They only document the<br/>\n&gt; set of<br/>\n&gt; the API that the authors chose to test, and they only test to the<br/>\n&gt; authors&#39;<br/>\n&gt; degrees of comfortability.  Truth be known, just because JUnit is in use<br/>\n&gt; does<br/>\n&gt; not mean that the code is being tested thoroughly.  Right?  You may be<br/>\n&gt; right<br/>\n&gt; that it could show you what isn&#39;t tested, but not necessarily why.  And<br/>\n&gt; it only<br/>\n&gt; gives you a clue as to what is not tested and what is.  There may not be<br/>\n&gt; a one<br/>\n&gt; to one mapping of the public API to the tests.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Granted.  I was assuming that the set of unit tests theoretically<br/>\nprovided by our imaginary vendor (has anyone ever seen a non-open source<br/>\nvendor do this?) would be reasonably thorough, complete, and<br/>\nrepresentative.  If the unit tests don&#39;t exercise all the documented<br/>\nmethods and boundaries of the API, they&#39;re incomplete anyway.  The hard<br/>\npart comes with testing coupling, interaction, and state changes between<br/>\ncomponents, where the non-trivial bugs often lurk.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOn a more philosophical level, i&#39;d suggest that most unit testing is<br/>\neither very useful, or mostly useless, depending on the confidence of<br/>\nthe programmer in the testing process.  Cowardly testing is a sign of a<br/>\nlack of confidence in the code.  Once a programmer gets in the habit of<br/>\nserious unit testing, the programmer will almost always be more<br/>\nconfident in the code - and thus more likely to test thoroughly.  Good<br/>\nunit testing is a self-reinforcing feedback loop.  And if i were given a<br/>\nset of unit tests from a vendor that clearly did not thoroughly test the<br/>\npublic interface of the software, i would immediately distrust the<br/>\nsoftware in question. <br/>\n-- <br/>\n<br/>\nDavid Stagner<br/>\n<br/>\nNational Marrow Donor Program<br/>\n3001 Broadway Street NE<br/>\nBroadway Ridge Suite 500<br/>\nMinneapolis, MN  55413<br/>\n<br/>\nEmail: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dstagner@...\">dstagner@...</a></div>",
