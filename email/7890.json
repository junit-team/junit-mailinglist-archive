By that <br/>\nI mean that an Ant toplevel project has to be told about its <br/>\nsubprojects to run them, in the same way an AllTests has to be told <br/>\nabout all the test cases to run them. Moreover Ant has to be <br/>\nexplicitly told about the dependency graphs between projects and <br/>\nthis usually involves shell scripts or some other wrapper around Ant <br/>\nand relience on the programmers to state the right build order. On <br/>\nthe other hand, make is very good at resolving project dependencies <br/>\nwith a minimal amount of information.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s not a problem as such since Ant wasn&#39;t designed to be make with <br/>\nangle brackets.<br/>\n<br/>\nBill de hÓra</div>",
