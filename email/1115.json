The one<br/>\nquestion I get a lot is, &quot;How do we test the results of a database query?&quot;<br/>\nThe former method of testing the query, was to manually review the results.<br/>\nThe one solution we&#39;ve come up with is to perform the query, save the<br/>\nresults to a file, then assert that the results from the live query are<br/>\nequivalent to the stored results in the file. This gets a little more tricky<br/>\nwhen the results data contains time-sensitive fields (i.e. date fields).<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, I just wanted to know whether anyone had come up with a simpler<br/>\nand/or better solution.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Mike</div>",
