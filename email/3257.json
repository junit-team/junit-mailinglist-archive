I then compiled <br/>\nTestTest <br/>\n&gt; and ProxyTestSuite using the provided jars and ran TestTest. My <br/>\n&gt; problem is that I don&#39;t seem to be able to get testSharing() to <br/>\n&gt; share. The initial value of sharing is false. Enter the first round <br/>\n&gt; of testSharing(), the assertion is confirmed and sharing is set to <br/>\n&gt; true. Enter the second testSharing(), the value is false again, as <br/>\n&gt; would be expected with the plain vanilla JUnit.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Can someone point me to the correct path?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Regards,<br/>\n&gt; Richard </span></blockquote></div>",
