Given that I have the \nlarge data set handled, do you still feel it is worth tackling this \ntype of testing using JUnit?? I have certain services that return \nobjects that correspond to a collection of API calls. So I compare \nthe two and assert that their states are the same. \nThanks,\nClaudio\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n--- In junit@yahoogroups.com, &quot;J. B.

I have a large app that basically wraps an API. The \ntesting\n&gt; &gt; that has to get setup needs to compare states between the app and \nthe\n&gt; &gt; API to ensure that all business rules comply at every state. Is \nthis\n&gt; &gt; something that JUnit can/should do? The app has many different \nstates\n&gt; &gt; that I would have to setUp() but I&#39;d like to know if using JUnit \nis\n&gt; &gt; the most effective way of testing this way?\n&gt; \n&gt; With JUnit, you simply send your application input and check its \noutput. \n&gt; The advantage to using JUnit is the ability to write the tests in \nJava, \n&gt; rather than some home-grown pseudo-scripting language (such as \nWinRunner \n&gt; provides). If the testing is largely data-driven, though, you may \nwish \n&gt; to consider using Fit/FitNesse (fitnesse.org). Here, &quot;data-driven&quot; \n&gt; means, for example, that you have one test algorithm to run with \n100 \n&gt; different rows of test input/expected output. Fit is much better at \nthat \n&gt; than JUnit is.\n&gt; -- \n&gt; J. B.
