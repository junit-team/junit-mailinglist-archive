It is a symbol of\n&gt;&gt; my commitment to this minmium level of professional ethics.  I WILL\n&gt;&gt; TEST MY CODE.\n&gt;\n&gt; Bob,\n&gt;\n&gt; While I don&#39;t agree with you 100% on Test First being THE solution, or\n&gt; THE right approach in ALL cases, I am definitely more in your camp\n&gt; than not.\n\nI am quite convinced that test-first is a good approach to a huge  \nmajority of software situations.  It is my default position.  When,  \nas very rarely happens, this approach leads to an apparent impasse, I  \nwill expend significant energy to find a way through before  \nabandoning the test-first approach.\n&gt;\n&gt; When Roongko and I were at SunLabs, we headed a research project\n&gt; called ADL (Assertion Definition Language) that was close in spirit to\n&gt; test first:\n\n&lt;&lt;description of test-first-like process elided&gt;&gt;\n\n&gt; The system worked just fine, but there was a big problem.  Most\n&gt; developers did not want to write specs first.  Let me be more\n&gt; specific: some of them did not want to, others could not do it. Some\n&gt; developers, including some very good ones, are not wired to think test\n&gt; first.  They could do it, but they would not be very effective at it -\n&gt; like asking a left-handed person to write with their write hand.\n\nI hear this objection a lot, in many different contexts:\n  - I know very good developers who aren&#39;t wired for OO.\n  - I know very good developers who aren&#39;t wired for clean code.\n  - I know very good developers who aren&#39;t wired for short iterations.\n\nMy reaction: These are not very good developers.  Why?  Because the  \nwiring argument is bogus.  A developer who &quot;isn&#39;t wired for X&quot; is  \nreally a developer who has decided that X doesn&#39;t suit him or her for  \none reason or another.  A developer who isn&#39;t &quot;wired&quot; for X is a  \ndeveloper who has decided not to learn.  And THAT DEFINES a poor  \ndeveloper.\n\nNote that I am not talking about agreement.  I know a very good  \ndeveloper who took the trouble to learn TDD and still remains  \nskeptical of the benfits.  And just so you understand where my  \nparticular values lie, I hired this person.  I value informed  \nskepticism.\n\nHowever, if someone can learn to write code, they can learn to write  \ntests, and they can learn to write tests first.  Yes, it requires a  \nchange in thinking process; but the ability to change thinking  \nprocess is critical to being a good developer.  The one thing a good  \ndeveloper can never do is get caught in a rut.  This industry changes  \ntoo quickly for that.\n\n&gt; Now, we could fire all people who refuse to, or are not good at test\n&gt; first, but I don&#39;t think that will work.\n\nActually I don&#39;t think we have to fire them.  They&#39;ll be gone into  \nother jobs soon enough.\n\n&gt; Over the years, and by\n&gt; looking at the way the world works (which I know is far from ideal), I\n&gt; have come to the conclusion that trying to globally change some\n&gt; behaviors (even when the new behavior is so obviously best for\n&gt; everyone (think smoking, eating junk, ..., not writing tests before\n&gt; writing your code)) is a noble, but pointless pursuit.\n\nI disagree.  We don&#39;t allow doctors to perform surgery before washing  \ntheir hands.  It took a lot of effort and angst to get doctors to  \nagree to this procedure when it was first discovered as beneficial.   \nI think the effort was noble, and certainly not pointless.\n\nI look at TDD in exactly the same way.  It is a minimum standard of  \nprofessionalism.  You wash your hands before you cut, or you don&#39;t  \ncut.  Period.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Let me attempt a simple analogy...\n\n&lt;&lt;cholesterol and exercise example elided&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Similarly, when it comes to developing code I agree with you 100% that\n&gt; developers should take responsibility for unit testing their own code\n&gt; (although I don&#39;t feel as strong as you do about test *first*, testing\n&gt; and testing well is what&#39;s most important to me).\n\nThere are two aspects of testing that deserve scrutiny.  First there  \nis test coverage.  There is no excuse for not achieving a test  \ncoverage number in the high 80s or 90s.  I use TDD to achieve that  \ngoal; but must respect any technique that can achieve it by another  \nmeans.\n\nThe second aspect is dual-entry-bookkeeping.  Accountants ensure the  \nreliability of their transactions by (among other things) entering  \nthem in two places.  Every transaction goes once on the credit books,  \nand once on the debit books.  The two books should eventually deliver  \nequal but opposite sums.\n\nTDD also provides this dual-entry nature.  Thought must be given to  \neach action of the software TWICE.  Once on the test side, and once  \non the production code side.  I find this to be a powerful error  \nelimination scheme.  In short, we don&#39;t depend on the production code  \nto tell us how to write the tests. We employ serious thought on both  \nsides.\n\n&gt; And I believe that the most effective way to get developers to test\n&gt; their code is to give them tools (JUnit is one, Agitator is another)\n&gt; to make them as efficient and as effective as possible.  To me, the\n&gt; desirable end result is well designed, well tested, well understood\n&gt; code using whatever methodology, technology, and tools are available\n&gt; and work best for the code and the people in question.\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; My problem is that I just don&#39;t know if the\n&gt;&gt; Agitation features of Agitar are really particularly useful.\n&gt;\n&gt; I don&#39;t know how to respond to that except to, perhaps, schedule a\n&gt; couple of days working *together* on real code to show you all the\n&gt; benefits that you get from agitation.\n\nI&#39;d love that.\n\n&gt; For example, do you know that\n&gt; you can use Agitator in a test-first way?\n\nI have tried this on a couple of occasions.  The experiences have not  \nresolved my questions.  But I&#39;d love to try again.\n\n&gt; Again, we did not wake  up\n&gt; one morning looking for a problem to solve with our technology.  I\n&gt; believe that the core ideas behind agitation are not only useful, but\n&gt; indispensable.\n\nThat&#39;s the puzzling thing for me.  I look at what Agitar does and I  \nthink it&#39;s very cool.  I love the random input generation, and the  \nclever way you hunt for likely input values.  I can&#39;t remember if you  \nguys do automatic mock generation, or whether that was JTest, but  \nthat&#39;s cool too.  JTest generates junit tests instead of  \nobservations. I find that interesting also.  But having used both  \nAgitar and JTest I am still left wondering when I would actually use  \nthe tool in anger.  The things that the tool has observed in my code  \nhave not (yet) been convincing.\n\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Moreover I fear a tool that can figure out tests for you may give\n&gt;&gt; developers an excuse not to write their own tests;\n&gt;\n&gt; Ah, you are missing one VERY CRITICAL point here.  Unlike other test\n&gt; automation products, Agitator does not &quot;figure out&quot; tests for you.\n\nYes, I know, it makes observations.  And you can then select those  \nobservations that you deem to be important and ignore those that aren&#39;t.\n\nActually, that&#39;s part of my confusion.  I&#39;ve looked at the long list  \nof observations, many of which are trivial, and wondered how much  \neffort it would take to understand each and decide whether or not  \nthey should be promoted to assertions.  And, then I noted that the  \nmost interesting things about my functions, the things I REALLY want  \nasserted, weren&#39;t observed.\n\n&lt;&lt;description of observation and assertion elided&gt;&gt;\n\n----\nRobert C.
