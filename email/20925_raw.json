Out goes a\nrequest, then if no money comes in out go a series of reminders. When the\nmoney comes in it has to be matched to the original request. If the amount\nis wrong, someone needs to figure out how to reconcile the situation. The\nbusiness logic in such situations can be incredibly complicated, primarily\nbecause of the wide range of scenarios that happen in real life. Part of the\nchallenge is automating as much processing as possible, but balance this by\nasking for manual assistance any time the business or the relationship with\nthe customer might be put at risk.\n \n&quot;Stability&quot; means how stable the API is that is being tested. An interface\nthat changes daily (not just accretion, but actual changes) probably\nshouldn&#39;t have automated tests--they are just a pain.\n \n&quot;Reliability&quot; means how likely the programmer is to make a mistake while\nprogramming. Code that is dead simple doesn&#39;t benefit much from tests, while\nwriting code with lots of logic and interactions can be helped by tests.\n \nRegards,\n \nKent Beck\nThree Rivers Institute\n\n  _____  \n\nFrom: junit@yahoogroups.com [mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com] On Behalf Of\ntoalexsmail\nSent: Tuesday, September 23, 2008 12:28 PM\nTo: junit@yahoogroups.com\nSubject: [junit] Re: Where to test?\n\n\n\nHi, Kent!\nYour example with Chart API is good. However, your example with\npayment processing is completely nightmare for me. I didn&#39;t understand\nwhat does the application, what client thought and what what problem\nyou strike with. I also didn&#39;t understand your Stability and\nReliability aspect. I guess this is because I didn&#39;t understand your\npayment processing example. \n\n--- In junit@yahoogroups. &lt;mailto:junit%40yahoogroups.com&gt; com, &quot;kentb&quot;\n&lt;kentb@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; All,\n&gt; \n&gt; Last week on succeeding days I encountered two situations, one where\n&gt; system-level tests were valuable and unit tests would have been\nuseless and\n&gt; one where the reverse was true. Since simply the level of the tests\nis not\n&gt; sufficient to decide where to test, I thought a bit more about how I\nshould\n&gt; decide where to test. I came to three criteria:\n&gt; * The cost of writing and running the test\n&gt; * The stability of the interface the test is, errr..., testing\n&gt; * The reliability of the code satisfying the test\n&gt; \n&gt; I wrote this up in a little paper:\n&gt; www.threeriversinstitute.org/WhereToTest.html. Comments welcome.\n&gt; \n&gt; Kent Beck\n&gt; Three Rivers Institute\n&gt;\n\n\n\n \n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n",
