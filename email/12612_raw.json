Now you want to test the clients of that \ninterface.\n\nIn production code, give your clients the real implementation of that \ninterface, that actually talks to the native code.\n\nIn tests, give your clients a &quot;fake&quot; implementation that simulates the \nnative code. Write a test for each different kind of response the \ninterface can give your clients to see how your clients respond.\n\nAlso in tests, give your clients a &quot;mock&quot; implementation that verifies \nhow clients use the native code: do they invoke the right methods with \nthe right parameters, and so on.\n\nFor more information on &quot;mock&quot; and &quot;fake&quot; (fakes are also called stubs), \nsearch the web and read _JUnit Recipes_, _Test Driven Development: A \nPractical Guide_, _JUnit in Action_ and other fine books and articles.\n-- \nJ.
