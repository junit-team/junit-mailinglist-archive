I run these test cases by firing off a\ntestRunner on the machine where my testCase code is located (locally).\n\nThe software I am testing is &quot;supposed&quot; to run on differnt OS&#39;s and\ndifferent versions of the JVM, and various combinations of the two.\n\nSo my question is this: is there some app I can use to kick off my\nregression suite (ideally form a web-browser) on many machines of\nvarying combinations of OS/JVMs remotely, BUT HAVE THE TESTS RUN ON\nTHE REMOTE MACHINE&#39;S OWN JVM??? Then the app should harvest all the\nresults and put them ideally in HTML/XML format?\n\nI understand JUnitEE does most of this already, however from my\nunderstanding, JUnitEE will run the tests from the JVM where the\nJUnitEE is installed, thus NOT testing the regression suites on\ndifferent JVMs.\n\nHas anyone ever tried to modify JUnitEE to do something like this?? Is\nther another tool I should look at instead??\n\nI&#39;m sure I could just write something like this myself, but if there\nis something out there I could drop in, I could spend more of my time\nwriting new test cases and less time writing tools to make my\nregression output &quot;manager freiendly&quot;.\n\n\nTIA,\n/mn\n\n\n\n",
