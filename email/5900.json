Of course I have worked on small to medium<br/>\nprojects that tried to incorporate almost every pattern under the<br/>\nsun--many times causing more bulk than necessary.  That is why I<br/>\ntermed it &quot;overuse&quot;, although &quot;inappropreate use&quot; applies better.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;The TestCase is taken, and by reflection is turned into a TestSuite.  So<br/>\n&gt;&gt;is it a TestCase or a TestSuite?  That is an important distinction.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;The Model is not readily apparent.  A stable and predictable model is<br/>\n&gt;&gt;essential to good design--esp. in this case.  I have no problem with<br/>\n&gt;&gt;saying that a TestCollector dynamically creates a TestSuite from a<br/>\n&gt;&gt;collection of TestCases.  That is understandable.  I do have a problem<br/>\n&gt;&gt;with the TestCase being treated as a TestSuite though.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; OK, I&#39;ll try to address this one.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; TestCase is a mechanism to allow fixture reuse.  An instance of a<br/>\n&gt; TestCase builds a fixture, runs a single test, and tears down the<br/>\n&gt; fixture. By allowing TestCase to contain multiple tests (i.e. public<br/>\n&gt; void testXXX() methods) you can share a fixture definition.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Put another way, TestCase is NOT a way to conceptually group tests. <br/>\n&gt; Each TestCase subclass represents a fixture, and contains a group of<br/>\n&gt; tests that run in the context of that fixture. Once you realize this,<br/>\n&gt; you&#39;ll find yourself switching (as I did some time ago) from having a<br/>\n&gt; TestCase for each class you are testing (with a overly generic fixture<br/>\n&gt; of which pieces were used by the different tests) to organizing tests<br/>\n&gt; around the fixtures, with less regard for the classes being tested by<br/>\n&gt; each TestCase.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I tend to test interfaces.  As such, with the current implementation of<br/>\nJUinit, I have one Abstract testcase to excersize the interface&#39;s<br/>\ncontracts.  I have concrete classes that extend that abstract test case<br/>\nfor the individual classes.  If there are specific issues or features<br/>\nof an implementation that need to be tested (i.e. consequences that<br/>\nare outside of the scope of the interface like ensuring temporary files<br/>\nare in the right place) I add new methods to the concrete test to ensure<br/>\nthat things are done properly.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs to what you are referring to as a Fixture, I am not exactly sure.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; TestSuite is a mechanism for grouping a collection of TestCase instances<br/>\n&gt; and running them sequentially.  So, TestCase has the ability to create a<br/>\n&gt; TestSuite containing all instances of itself (using reflection to create<br/>\n&gt; an instance for each constituent test).  Also, you have the ability to<br/>\n&gt; create explicit TestSuites by subclassing TestSuite and writing a custom<br/>\n&gt; suite() method.  This is useful for collecting together groups of<br/>\n&gt; smaller TestSuites which can be other custom TestSuites, or TestSuites<br/>\n&gt; generated by TestCases.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>That&#39;s the thing.  The TestSuite, while theorhetically a nice feature,<br/>\nadds too much.  You also run the risk/temptation to write tests that<br/>\nrequire to be run in a specific order to pass.  If the order is changed,<br/>\nor unpredictable, you have to write more robust tests.<br/>\n<br/>\nNine times out of ten, all you really need is a TestCollector.  The<br/>\ncollector finds all your tests, and runs them.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Both TestSuite and TestCase implement the Test interface. The<br/>\n&gt; TestRunners work with things that are Tests, hence we can point at any<br/>\n&gt; Test (ie TestSuite or TestCase) and recursively run all the contained<br/>\n&gt; tests.  The internal nodes are TestSuites and the leaves are TestCases.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yes, but what happens if you don&#39;t want to extend either TestCase or<br/>\nTestSuite?  What happens if you want to access Assert from TestSuite?<br/>\nThe contracts are with the *implementations* of the Test interface,<br/>\nand not with the Test interface itself.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I hope that makes things clearer.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>What about the other points I had?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;They that give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary safety<br/>\n  deserve neither liberty nor safety.&quot;<br/>\n                 - Benjamin Franklin</div>",
