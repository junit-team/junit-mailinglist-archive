Its been about 5yrs since I made a =\r\nsignificant part\n&gt; of my living from writing code. Instead I spend most of =\r\nmy time and effort\n&gt; coaching and training clients on the basic Agile ideas=\r\n. In the past few\n&gt; weeks I&#39;ve spent a lot of time with a client that build=\r\ns Java applications.\n&gt; This has brought me back to JUnit.\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;m in shock,=\r\n you&#39;re discussing how to use Lambda&#39;s well when some of the\n&gt; basic elemen=\r\nts are hard to use correctly. Examples Categories - require a\n&gt; special run=\r\nner and the use of suites; Parameterized Data - requires a\n&gt; special runner=\r\n etc.\n&gt;\n&gt; The Categories is the worst one. The client had some slow tests t=\r\nhat should\n&gt; be removed from their main unit test suite and run only on nig=\r\nhtly builds.\n&gt; Over time they want to revisit the tests, speed them up (usi=\r\nng Fake DB and\n&gt; In Memory streams etc). In the world of Nunit no problem w=\r\ne would just mark\n&gt; them as members of the category slow and run them separ=\r\nately on the build\n&gt; server. In JUnit the requirement to use suites for thi=\r\ns capability was so\n&gt; painful that we just migrated the tests to a separate=\r\n eclipse project.\n&gt; Their parameterized tests several were missing the anno=\r\ntations for the\n&gt; special test runner. There are a number of other small de=\r\ntails where JUnit\n&gt; makes it a little harder than necessary to do the work.=\r\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Suggestion before debating an attractive Lambda syntax, make the exist=\r\ning\n&gt; features easy to use. In addition take NUnit for spin you might find =\r\nsome\n&gt; good ideas on how to handle many of these details.\n&gt;\n&gt; --\n&gt; Cheers\n&gt;=\r\n Mark Levison\n&gt; Agile Pain Relief Consulting http://agilepainrelief.com/not=\r\nesfromatooluser\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; | Writing http://agilepainrelief.com/notesfromatoolus=\r\ner/&gt;\n&gt; Proud Sponsor of Agile Tour Gatineau Ottawa http://goagiletour.ca/&gt; =\r\nNov\n&gt; 28, Toronto http://www.torontoagilecommunity.org/display/PUBLIC/Home&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; 26 and Montreal http://agilemontreal.ca/agile-tour-2012/&gt; 24\n&gt;\n&gt; [Non-te=\r\nxt portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\n\n\n-- \nMaybe she awo=\r\nke to see the roommate&#39;s boyfriend swinging from the\nchandelier wearing a b=\r\noar&#39;s head.\n\nSomething which you, I, and everyone else would call &quot;Tuesday&quot;=\r\n, of course.\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n",
