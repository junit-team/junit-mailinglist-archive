Running each test method\n&gt;&gt; in its own\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; instance shields you from any problem.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; e.g. static class members are not safely initialized if you share\n&gt;&gt;&gt; instances.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I&#39;m not sure what you mean. Perhaps you could clarify? The static\n&gt;&gt; variables will be initialized once when the class is first &quot;actively&quot;\n&gt;&gt; used, not when each instance is created.\n&gt;\n&gt; You said exactly what I meant:\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; If you&#39;re using\n&gt;&gt; JUnit&#39;s Swing\n&gt;&gt; runner and reloading classes each time, the static members will be\n&gt;&gt; initialized once per run.\n&gt;\n&gt; So, why does the text runner not use the class reloading?\n&gt; Does the swing runner use class-reloading &quot;only&quot; for that it can be\n&gt; used from within an IDE?\n&gt;\nI believe the text runner does in effect reload classes each time by \nexiting the app after each run. Each time you run with the text runner, \nyou get a new VM, which reloads classes anew. I believe this is the \ncase. It has been a while since I used the text runner.\n\nbv\n--\nBill Venners\nArtima Software, Inc.\nhttp://www.artima.com\n\n\n\n",
