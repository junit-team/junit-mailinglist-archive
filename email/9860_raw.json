B. Rainsberger wrote:\n&gt; Really? I thought AOP is best for weaving the same code into multiple \n&gt; locations without duplicating it. Extending the TestRunner looks to be \n&gt; much simpler, since one only needs to decorate the TestListener to log \n&gt; the start and end times.\n&gt; \n&gt; I do think it&#39;s very neat, though, to log all that stuff transparently \n&gt; and review it over time.\n\nYep you are right. I figured there was a way to do it through the \nframework, but I was just throwing out a suggestion.  I expected someone \nwith more knowledge on the JUnit framework would give a better solution \n(which you did).\n\nUse the simplest tool that is appropriate for the job :).\n\n-- Chad\n\n\n",
