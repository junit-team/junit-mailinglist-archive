If<br/>\n&gt; all you test is public/protected methods, you will miss an<br/>\n&gt; opportunity to catch a bug in a very fundamental piece of<br/>\n&gt; your code and you will be wasting time looking for it.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>What this comes down to is that it&#39;s &quot;different strokes for<br/>\ndifferent folks&quot;. Some people hate testing private methods,<br/>\nothers don&#39;t mind it. Personally, I don&#39;t have a problem<br/>\ntesting package-level methods, but wouldn&#39;t jump through<br/>\nhoops to test truly-private methods. (Indeed, as I often<br/>\nhave classes with extensive interaction within the package,<br/>\nthis is pretty important)<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, one very good piece of advice is: if you feel a<br/>\ndriving need to test a non-public method, it&#39;s a _possible_<br/>\nsign that you have a new class trying to emerge out of the<br/>\ncurrent one.<br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; For example, imagine you are writing a file manager that<br/>\n&gt; can list your files in several orders (by date, by name,<br/>\n&gt; etc...) and therefore, makes use of several types of<br/>\n&gt; algorithms, all private.  One day, the program starts<br/>\n&gt; showing the files in the wrong order.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The sort algorithm is not exposed to anyone, but if you<br/>\n&gt; unit-test it, you will catch the error much earlier<br/>\n&gt; instead of starting to investigate, say, your list widget.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Here&#39;s an excellent example. :) The sort algorithims are<br/>\nprobably a fairly generic sort of beast that could be made<br/>\ninto seperate classes without any loss of abstraction.<br/>\nIndeed, that&#39;s what the java.util.Comparator interface is<br/>\nfor. So you could then write tests for the comparators<br/>\ndirectly.<br/>\n<br/>\nAgain, however, this comes more down to personal preference<br/>\nthan any solid rule. The basics are: unit tests should try<br/>\nto be very fine grained. This may have the side effect of<br/>\nincreasing visibility of methods as you look closer at the<br/>\ndetails. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Don&#39;t be dogmatic about testing:  test whatever you think<br/>\n&gt; can break.  And it&#39;s okay if it includes private methods.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>&quot;Wot &#39;e said&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nRobert.</div>",
