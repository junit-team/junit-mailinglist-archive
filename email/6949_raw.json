I&#39;m not sure how to fix it. I just got used to\nit.\n\nI didn&#39;t know that test case objects were being pooled. That&#39;s\ninteresting. What were you doing in a test case object that caused\nproblems with pooling? Maybe we can learn something about your design.\n\nYou can see, though, why there is a setUp() method rather than doing\nthat initialization in a constructor. In fact, I think the docs say\nthat explicitly somewhere, and if they don&#39;t, then they certainly\nshould.\n\nSo said  Eric Armstrong  on  2/12/2003 --------------------\n\n&gt;Somehow, I was under the impression that each test\n&gt;in a test case started with a &quot;clean slate&quot; -- that the\n&gt;setup code was re-run for each test method.\n&gt;\n&gt;But that doesn&#39;t appear to be the case. The test object\n&gt;created during setup turned out to be reused for\n&gt;subsequent tests in the test case, which caused problems\n&gt;arising from old state, until I figured it out.\n&gt;\n&gt;Now, for performance, it only makes sense that a fixture\n&gt;would be reused for each test in a test case class. So I&#39;m\n&gt;not suggesting that the implementation is wrong.\n&gt;\n&gt;But I read the docs at the main site, and I&#39;ve been following\n&gt;these threads for quite a while, and still I had a dead-wrong\n&gt;impression of what&#39;s going on.\n&gt;\n&gt;For example, in the FAQ, q2 &quot;How do I use a text fixture?&quot;\n&gt;says:\n&gt;   &quot;Each test runs in its own test fixture to isolate tests from the\n&gt;   changes made by other tests. Because the tests are isolated,\n&gt;   they can be run in any order.... The JUnit framework\n&gt;   automatically invokes the setUp() method before each test is\n&gt;   run and the tearDown() method after each test is run.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;Now for &quot;test&quot;, I was reading &quot;test *method*&quot;. As in testX(),\n&gt;testY(). But my recent epiphany suggests that I should have\n&gt;been reading it as &quot;test *case*&quot;, as in &quot;test-case class&quot;. And\n&gt;since the example shows a single test case class, with multiple\n&gt;test methods in it, it was easy to make that assumption.\n&gt;\n&gt;Note:\n&gt;In general, I&#39;m not much fond of the name, &quot;TestCase&quot;, because\n&gt;to me that represents a single test. Since a TestCase class can\n&gt;actually have multiple test methods, the name &quot;TestFixture&quot; is\n&gt;probably more appropriate. But be that as it may...\n&gt;\n&gt;It appears to me that the word &quot;test&quot; is badly overloaded in the\n&gt;docs, meaning at various times, test method, test case, and\n&gt;potentially even test suite.\n&gt;\n&gt;The best way to eliminate confusion that I can see is to do a\n&gt;global search on &quot;test &quot;, and replace with one of the hyphenated\n&gt;words &quot;test-method&quot;, &quot;test-case&quot;, or &quot;test-suite&quot;, as appropriate.\n\nJ.
