In a method the static initializer calls, I add the package\nname onto the class path. But because the class path now had two\nclasspaths separated with a semi colon, the full directory name was\ninvalid. \n\nI have resolved it by splitting the classpath around semicolons and\nlooping through each classpath.\n\n \n\nRegards,\n\nChris\n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n",
