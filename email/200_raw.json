The solution is to use the same package but a different\ndirectory.  As long as your classpath includes both directories when you are testing all the necessary classes will be\nfound and everything should work fine.\n\n/src/java/com/nameless/foo.java\n/src/javatest/com/nameless/fooTest.java\n\n/classes/java/com/nameless/foo.class\n/classes/javatest/com/nameless/fooTest.class\n\nI seem to recall this being suggested somewhere in the JUnit documentation.\n\nI do this from within JBuilder with two projects working in parallel.  The application is configured as a library to the\ntesting project.  JBuilder seems to want to recompile the application classes into the testing class directory structure\nbut this causes no real problems.\n\nScott\n\nYongqing Ye wrote:\n&gt; when i write test case for application, normally i group all the testcases\n&gt; in one package and application in another package. when i write test case\n&gt; for applicaiton method, i encounter one problem:\n&gt; some method is private, so testcase can not access it. i have to make the\n&gt; method public.\n&gt; in C++, we can use friend to solve this problem , but i can not do it in\n&gt; java.\n&gt; any solution?\n\n\n\n",
