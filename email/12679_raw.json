In my opinion, this isn&#39;t something that can break.  Instead I \n&gt; would test\n&gt;  &gt;the super class implementation.  On that same note, why do you even have\n&gt;  &gt;these methods here?  Are you opening up the access level (from default or\n&gt;  &gt;protected to public)?\n&gt; \n&gt; As someone who practises TDD  I would have written the test first, then\n&gt; implemented the derived class.  Then possibly refactored the derive\n&gt; class to call the base class method, then further refactored the derived\n&gt; class to remove the overridden method, seeing as it now does nothing.\n&gt; \n&gt; However, after all of this, I&#39;m still testing the public interface of\n&gt; the derived class.\n\nUnnecessarily so.\n\n&gt; Then if the derived class is refactored again to do something additional\n&gt; to the super class, our existing test will let know if anything is\n&gt; broken. Also, if we refactor the super class because of some need of\n&gt; another derived class, we know whether we have broken any derived\n&gt; classes assumptions of how the super class works.\n\nAre you prepared have n+1 copies of the tests for a given superclass \nmethod, one for the superclass and one for each of the n known \nsubclasses? I&#39;m not.\n\nI change the test to work with the superclass, and when (in the future) \nI change the subclass&#39;s implementation, I would test-drive the new \nbehavior, (re)creating the tests I need.\n-- \nJ.
