I don&#39;t know whether they are all equivalent\nregarding completeness.\n\nThe second aspect is the one is where the most confusion between JTest,\nJUnit and our tool, Test Mentor come in. JTest examines your code a class at\na time and derives a set of inputs that will drive code paths for those\nclasses, for the purpose of detecting unhandled exceptions. The scheme it\nuses does not naturally find logic errors. You need to write tests for this,\nalthough you can capture simple inputs and outputs as &#39;regression&#39; tests.\nThis is certainly useful, but you&#39;re not going to find very many logic\nerrors this way without a lot of work, and validation is fairly primitive.\n\nThe biggest weak points for JTest are:\n1) JTest does not actually execute code in a Java virtual machine. According\nto the Parasoft engineer that I spoke with, JTest simulates execution, but\nyou are not really running your code on any particular Java platform.\n2) JTest tests are very class centric and do not scale up to clusters for\nframeworks. This means that it will be difficult for your to test a class in\nthe context of other collaborating classes.\n3) JTest is rather expensive (around $3500?).\n4) JTest is very slow. In all fairness it is doing a tremendous amount of\ncomputation in parsing code and simulating execution, but it&#39;s not something\nyou&#39;d be able to run every few minutes - more like overnight.\n5) It takes a while to crawl through the output that JTest creates. There\nare usually quite a number of false positives and you have to do a bit of\nmanual work to figure out which output indicates real problems, or spend\nsome time configuring the tool to ignore certain conditions.\n\nIf you have the money, you might want to consider purchasing a single\nlicense to run periodically overnight on a lab machine. If you&#39;re already\ndoing a good job writing real tests with JUnit or a commercial tool like\nTest Mentor, it will probably be redundant.\n\nIf you are at the end of a cycle and have no time or intention to write\ntests, you might consider using JTest to do a massive sweep of your code.\nIt&#39;s bound to find something interesting. Just be careful that if you use\nJTest to find problems and then start fixing them, you may introduce new\nlogic problems in your code that JTest does not find.\n\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\nMike Silverstein\nSilverMark, Inc.\nThe object testing company\nhttp://www.silvermark.com\n\n&gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; From: Marco Pas [mailto:marco.pas@...]\n&gt; Sent: Wednesday, July 11, 2001 5:59 AM\n&gt; To: junit@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Subject: [junit] JUnit or JTest ?\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; We are evaluating products and was wondering about your opinion about\n&gt; which tools to use for unit testing.\n&gt;\n&gt; Criteria are:\n&gt; - fast/flexible development of test cases\n&gt; - usable in a j2ee architecture\n&gt; - support for regression testing.\n&gt;\n&gt; Any opinion from you would be highly appreciated.\n&gt; Kind Regards,\n&gt; Marco Pas\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
