Once\nyou h=\r\nave many tests for all you separate functionality, then think about\nhow to =\r\ntest inside a application server.\n\nGenerally testing inside an application =\r\nserver is more difficult and\nshould not be your first goal for unit testing=\r\n.\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: Alagusundaram Paulraj [mailto:apaulra@q=\r\nwest.com]\nSent: 06 September 2001 20:48\nTo: junit@yahoogroups.com\nSubject: =\r\nRe: [junit] Need help\n\n\nJason\n      Thanks for detailed mail.In my project =\r\nthey have already test\ncases for java programs.Our application have\n4 layer=\r\ns we are using weblogic.\n\nI am struck up with environment setup on Jbuilder=\r\n to test with Junit in\nweblogic server.\n\nI am using Windows NT m/c\n\n\n\nJason=\r\n Rogers wrote:\n\n&gt; A.P.\n&gt;\n&gt; There is a lot of documentation and plenty of ex=\r\namples hanging around\nthat\n&gt; would give you a place to start.  Look at JUni=\r\nt&#39;s tests for instance.\nLook\n&gt; at the sample Money tests that are published=\r\n with JUnit.  Go to\njunit.org,\n&gt; or the junit wiki, or the SourceForge site=\r\n, etc.  I think it would be\na good\n&gt; idea for you to try learning what you =\r\ncan from the documentation and\n&gt; examples that already exist, then, when yo=\r\nu have more specific\nquestions,\n&gt; ask the group.\n&gt;\n&gt; It isn&#39;t that we are u=\r\nnwilling to answer questions, it&#39;s just that I\nthink\n&gt; most people expect t=\r\nhat new comers will put forth some effort in\naddressing\n&gt; the learning curv=\r\ne.  Personaly, I don&#39;t expect you to make yourself\n&gt; completely versed in J=\r\nUnit, I simply expect you to familiarize\nyourself with\n&gt; the product enough=\r\n to be able to ask intelligent questions about it.\n&gt;\n&gt; Try to understand wh=\r\nat an Assert is, what a TestCase is, what a\nTestResult\n&gt; is, what a TestRun=\r\nner is...  These are the basics.  (Actually, you\ncould\n&gt; even skip TestResu=\r\nlt for now.)  Then, if you have a class that you\nalready\n&gt; know you want to=\r\n write tests for (or you are doing test first design\nand\n&gt; have an idea of =\r\nthe class you will be writing) tell us about it.  We\nwill\n&gt; then have a com=\r\nmon language for describing how to write the tests --\nJUnit&#39;s\n&gt; framework!\n=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; I hope you don&#39;t take this email offensively.  I understand that it is\n=\r\n&gt; sometimes overwhelming to learn a new product (JUnit), not to mention\na n=\r\new\n&gt; paradigm (unit testing or testing in general).  I only hope to guide\ny=\r\nou to\n&gt; some possible good starting places.\n&gt;\n&gt; -Jason\n&gt;\n&gt;     &gt; -----Origi=\r\nnal Message-----\n&gt;     &gt; From: Alagusundaram Paulraj [mailto:apaulra@qwest.=\r\ncom]\n&gt;     &gt; Sent: Friday, August 31, 2001 12:31 PM\n&gt;     &gt; To: junit@yahoo=\r\ngroups.com\n&gt;     &gt; Subject: Re: [junit] Need help\n&gt;     &gt;\n&gt;     &gt;\n&gt;     &gt; I=\r\n also need to know how to write test cases in Java using Junit\n&gt;     &gt;\n&gt;   =\r\n  &gt; Pankaj Solanki wrote:\n&gt;     &gt;\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; Hello, I am a newcomer to testi=\r\nng world.I will be using\n&gt;     &gt; JUnit3.7 tool\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; for unit testing. =\r\nAt present my assignment is to write unit\ntest\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; release procedure.=\r\n Will you please help me out in this\n&gt;     &gt; activity such\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; as how=\r\n to proceed, what to include, how the code passes from\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; developers=\r\n to tester or do we have any templates / design\nguides\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; ?
