Static typing is the illusion of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; safety, I choose the former.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Code that uses both will always be safer than code that only uses one of\n&gt; &gt; these.\n&gt; That is a very striking statement. Are you saying that (in your opinion) \n&gt; static languages are inherently safer than dynamic languages?\n\nHere is my experience (although this could probably be derided as &quot;opinion&quot;,\ncouldn&#39;t it?):\n\n* I have written a complete OR mapping (which is in productive use in about\n6 projects of a large retail company) in Java. Java&#39;s (JDK1.2) collections\nhave dynamic typing for their contents. Using quite explicit naming\nconventions so that parameters, instance variables and local variables spell\ntheir type quite directly (childAssocNodes for a collection of\nAbstractAssociationNodes), no single letter names even for local vars etc.,\nI felt quite comfortable with this. A similar experience from a\nsmaller-sized Smalltalk project (about people, about 1 year) about 10 years\nago was the same.\n\n* Still, when I converted a few larger tools to JDK1.5 (up to now, alas, not\nthe large ORMapping) it felt like &quot;finally being there&quot;.\nI have also written a library for bidirectional associations in C#, using\nC#&#39;s generics. The &quot;good feeling&quot; (ok - it&#39;s opinion after all ...) that you\ndo not even need to run the (in that case, extensive and written TDD-style)\nunit tests, because you can be sure that &quot;if it compiles, it is correct&quot;, is\nsomething that helps (me) very much when writing intricate algorithms.\n\nHowever, these experiences may be because I am a &quot;static thinker&quot;: The\nmathematical concepts of static invariants and other static constraints are\na main technique for me when designing algorithms. As far as I know, there\nare many more &quot;execution type people&quot; around who need something that &quot;runs&quot;\nto be &quot;emotionally happy&quot;.\n\nMaybe this explains that (to me sometimes &quot;religious&quot;) discussion on static\nvs. dynamic typing - might it be the old difference between the &quot;let&#39;s\ncompute it!&quot;-type engineer and the &quot;let&#39;s build/try it!&quot;-type engineer? -\nwhere both have their well-founded arsenal of tools to support their\ntechniques - e.g. redundant over-the-thumb-checks against reality in the\ncase of the &quot;static computation&quot; guy, scaffolding/mocks/test runs in the\ncase of the &quot;executing&quot; guy - and are quite happy with it?\n\n... but probably that&#39;s now too much &quot;laymean&#39;s philosophy&quot; or something\nlike that ...\n\nRegards\nHarald M.\n\n-- \n10 GB Mailbox, 100 FreeSMS/Monat http://www.gmx.net/de/go/topmail\n+++ GMX - die erste Adresse f�r Mail, Message, More +++\n\n",
