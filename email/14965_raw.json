When \n&gt; using code coverage tools on test code I&#39;ve found tests that weren&#39;t \n&gt; being executed due to incorrect naming conventions, asserts that\nweren&#39;t \n&gt; reached due to bad logic, and vestigial code I no longer needed that \n&gt; could be deleted. There normally won&#39;t be as much untested code in the \n&gt; test suite as their is in the main body of code. However there&#39;s\nusually \n&gt; some; and, while some of it are fail() statements and the like that you \n&gt; don&#39;t want to be reached, some of it is significant and requires a\nrepair.\n&gt; \n\n\n\n\n",
