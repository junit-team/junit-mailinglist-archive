    "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1334067671\">A while ago I had an email conversation with Bruce Vinchon regarding <br/>\ndatabase testing. I said I&#39;d mention something we discussed on this mailing <br/>\nlist so here goes (and apologies to Bruce if I&#39;ve misrepresented his thoughts).<br/>\n<br/>\nBruce mentioned using the &quot;auto commit off&quot; trick to make database testing <br/>\neasier.   I.e., you do something like turn auto commit off during setUp() <br/>\nand do an rollback/abort in tearDown(), so you can write to a test database <br/>\nand not have to worry about cleaning it up. Something like that.<br/>\n<br/>\nI replied talking about the problems when you have methods which are <br/>\nthemselves transactions (i.e., methods which<br/>\nstart transactions, write to various tables, then commit).  How can you use <br/>\nthe &quot;auto commit off&quot; trick in those situations?<br/>\n<br/>\nBruce suggested that you may be able to get something to work with nested <br/>\ntransactions, perhaps using a transaction service such as JTA/JTS.  Sounds <br/>\ngood to me, but I haven&#39;t had the opportunity to investigate this idea or <br/>\nthe Java Transaction APIs.<br/>\n<br/>\nCan anyone comment on this approach?<br/>\n<br/>\nRegards<br/>\nRichard</div>",
