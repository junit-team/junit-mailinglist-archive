Based on the message returned my\ntestcase will pass or fail.\nAdditionally I have to have multiple testcases that will send messages\nusing the same connection. Note that the server maintains a session\ninformation on the client connection. \nHow do i share this session information(connection + related crap)\nacross testcases, so that i can execute a sequence of testcases which\nwill all use the same connection. One mechanism i thought of was\nextending a testcase that will contain the connection and use it as a\nfixture, all testcases will call that as a fixture but how do i shared\nthe connection from the fixture to other testcases which them selves\nneed to send messages?\nThanks\nAkhil Srinivasan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
