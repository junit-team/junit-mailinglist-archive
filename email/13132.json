(&quot;create&quot; should be enough, but our bought<br/>\nframework requires a longer method name)<br/>\n- updateArticle(...)<br/>\n- deleteArticle(...)<br/>\n- persistArticle(...)<br/>\n- findArticleById(...) (works with EJB QL internally)<br/>\n- findArticleByWhatever(...)<br/>\n- getArticleFactory()<br/>\n<br/>\nThe DAOs are generated by a generator and store and retrieve Transfer<br/>\nObjects. These TOs contain validation rules like maxLength(ID, 5).<br/>\n<br/>\nWe do some pre-initializations in the factory, for example in<br/>\nSupplierFactory. There we initialize a few attributes like<br/>\nmainPurchaser = getCurrentUser().<br/>\n<br/>\nIn our JUnit tests we test a lot:<br/>\n- the instance returned by the factory whether it contains certain<br/>\ninitializations we expect<br/>\n- the finders<br/>\n- the validation rules<br/>\n- the create update and delete methods<br/>\n<br/>\nNow some say that we needn&#39;t do so much testing in the persistance<br/>\nlayer. I am not sure about it.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor example, the create, update and delete methods are generated by<br/>\nthe generator. Would it be better only to test just one DAO instead of<br/>\nall DAOs?<br/>\n<br/>\nLets illustrate it. Article has a many:one relation to<br/>\nMeasurementUnit. In our test we persist a MeasurementUnit, set the<br/>\npersisted MeasurementUnit to Article<br/>\n(newArticle.setMeasurementUnit(persistedMu)) and then persist Article.<br/>\nAfter that we load Article and verify that<br/>\nfoundArticle.getMeasurementUnit() is not null.<br/>\n<br/>\nDo we do too much testing here? How do you test these things? Or don&#39;t<br/>\nyou test them or only some of them? Is there any code example of such<br/>\na test? What about the finders and the validation rules: Do you test them?</div>",
