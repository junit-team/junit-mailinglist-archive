Until a few months ago all our tests were JUnit 3.8 tests org=\r\nanized with AllTests suite.\n\nThen we introduced JUnit 4.5 and we started ha=\r\nving:\n*) 3.8 suites running a mix of 3.8 & 4.5 tests\n*) 4.5 suites running =\r\n4.5 tests\nI don&#39;t think we ever had 4.5 suites running 3.8 tests as well.\n\n=\r\nAt the root of everything there were 3 main 3.8 suites. Let&#39;s call them:\n*)=\r\n AllTestsSuite1 (related to project P1) =3D=3D&gt; ~650 tests (mostly unit tes=\r\nts)\n*) AllTestsSuite2 (related to project P2) =3D=3D&gt; ~350 tests (a mix of =\r\nunit tests and HttpUnit tests)\n*) AllTestsSuite3 (related to project P3) =\r\n=3D=3D&gt; ~500 tests (mostly HttpUnit tests)\nThe 3 suites are merged together=\r\n in a big bang 3.8 suites, called AllSuperMegaHyperTestSuite for evident re=\r\nasons :)\n\nAll the tests run fine with 196 MB of heap until a few days ago.\n=\r\nEvery developer runs typically one of the 3 suites above, not AllSuperMegaH=\r\nyperTestSuite, depending on which area of the system they are working on. \n=\r\nI run AllSuperMegaHyperTestSuite from time to time. Hudson runs it with Clo=\r\nver every day.\n\nSome days ago we noticed an increase in memory consumption,=\r\n noticeable on Hudson only. We thought that this was related more to Clover=\r\n than anything else.\n\nBut when we decided to get rid of 3.8 suites in P1 it=\r\n became very noticeable. The message on the Spring Framework forum confirme=\r\nd my doubts: a memory leak related to 3.8 tests run by 4.5 suites. Implemen=\r\nting the suggested fix didn&#39;t help though.\n\nSo we have proceeded converting=\r\n all 3.8 tests to 4.5 in P1: the situation has improved significantly, but =\r\nstill now the tests run only with 1048 MB of heap (and 128 MB of PermGen sp=\r\nace). Now, I don&#39;t think that the root of the problem is necessarily in JUn=\r\nit, but the way it holds onto instance fields in the tests doesn&#39;t help =3D=\r\n=3D&gt; some of our tests, especially those based on HttpUnit, have a lot of s=\r\ntate in instance fields.\n\nSo I was wondering if this &quot;issue&quot; (well, whateve=\r\nr you wanna call it) is known to you guys, if workarounds are available, et=\r\nc.\nWe think of converting all 3.8 tests to 4.5 in P2 & P3 anyway. That shou=\r\nld help, if I&#39;m not mistaken.\n\n&gt; Is that right? If so, it&#39;s certainly troub=\r\nling. Some questions to\n&gt; help identify a potential JUnit bug:\n\n&gt; 1) Do you=\r\n run out of memory if you use ClasspathSuite, but skip the 4.5 tests?\n\nWell=\r\n, right now I don&#39;t have any 3.8 tests anymore in P1. When I&#39;ll get rid of =\r\nthe suites in P2 I&#39;ll try avoiding 4.5 tests first for sure.\n\n&gt; 2) Do you r=\r\nun out of memory if you replace your AllTests suite with a 4.5-style Suite?=\r\n\n\nHaven&#39;t tried that. I suppose I can give it a shot in P2.\n\nThanks,\nGiulia=\r\nno\n\n\n-- \nPiergiuliano Bossi\nhttp://thinkingbox.wordpress.com/\nhttp://stackt=\r\nrace.it\n\n\n",
