But isn&#39;t it possible to build the application\nonce a day, or make a partial build (e.g. for one platform)?  If your system is\ncomplex, try to isolate the application to test.  For example, if your working\nwith CORBA, don&#39;t test the corba bridge (your tests acting like a CORBA client)\nbut test your CORBA interface (your tests acting like a CORBA bridge).  You&#39;ll\nbe able to test your CORBA code without starting a server.\n\nIf someone forgets to test their code or checks in the wrong code... well\nmistakes happen.  But having 1 (a) or 100 (b) errors while running your tests\ntells you exactly the same thing: you have bugs in your code.  Not to forget\nthat (a) is the same error as the first error of (b).\n\n&gt; everyone was testing their code multiple times a day and builds were a \n&gt; daily occurrence, but some of us are in traditional with the &quot;fragile&quot; \n&gt; way of doing things and are doing the best we can ;-)\n\nso fix it! :-)  Set up a dedicated build server and install a tool to check out\nyour code every day from CVS, compile it, execute the tests and report the\nerrors (like continuous integration on SF).\n\ngood luck\n\n-Vladimir\n\r\n--\nVladimir Bossicard\nwww.bossicard.com\n\n",
