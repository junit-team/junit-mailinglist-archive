As has already been suggested your *Helper may want to<br/>\nhave different names, some may want to be merged, some broken up. And<br/>\naccording to my taste stop being static and then injected to the class<br/>\nyou want to test.<br/>\n<br/>\nA lot of good stuff can be found here:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.objectmentor.com/resources/publishedArticles.html\">http://www.objectmentor.com/resources/publishedArticles.html</a><br/>\n(click on by topic  | design)<br/>\n<br/>\nI would start looking at the single responsibility principle. That is<br/>\nin my experience the principle that had the biggest impact on my<br/>\nunit-testing (together with the depenency inversion principle).<br/>\n<br/>\nb) consider making them package-private or default if you prefer to<br/>\ncall it that (remove the private, protected, public modifier<br/>\nentirely). This is just above private, these methods are only<br/>\naccessible by other classes in the same package. Not even subclasses<br/>\ncan access them if they are in a different package (there is a common<br/>\nmisunderstanding that default  less restricted than protected, it&#39;s<br/>\nreally the other way around.<br/>\n<br/>\nc) perform securitymanager stunts to acces the actual private methods.<br/>\nI would consider this a bit paranoid.<br/>\n<br/>\nI look at both b) and c) as workarounds. Sometimes we need workarounds<br/>\nuntil we figure out how everything should fit.<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course, if you are comfortable with the helper style, by all means<br/>\ncontinue with that. From where I&#39;m standing it looks like it is the<br/>\ndesign part of TDD that wants to be listened to. I am standing quite<br/>\nfar away though so I may be wrong.<br/>\n<br/>\n/J<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On 2/21/07, Ole Ersoy &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ole_ersoy@...\">ole_ersoy@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Yes - I assumed parts of the &quot;All Methods Public&quot;<br/>\n&gt; thread in here.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To summarize:<br/>\n&gt; By putting methods on a Helper and making them public<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m simulating being able to turn off<br/>\n&gt; private/protected checking on methods in the JVM, so<br/>\n&gt; that all methods can be easily tested and receive the<br/>\n&gt; benefits of test driven development, while keeping the<br/>\n&gt; tests tightly linked to the methods they are testing.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Cheers,<br/>\n&gt; - Ole<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --- CÃ(c)dric Beust â™&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:cbeust@...\">cbeust@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; On 2/20/07, Ole Ersoy &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ole_ersoy@...\">ole_ersoy@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Or do it in reverse.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Declare private methods on the Class, and have<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; builder create the ClassHelper.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m a bit confused where this discussion is going.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; If my class needs helper methods that it will be the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; only one using, I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; make them private on that same class (ideally,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; static private if they<br/>\n&gt; &gt; don&#39;t modify any state).<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Only if these helper methods can be useful to other<br/>\n&gt; &gt; classes would I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; consider extracting them in a separate Helper class.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; --<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Cédric<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://testng.org\">http://testng.org</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; __________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; Never miss an email again!<br/>\n&gt; Yahoo!
