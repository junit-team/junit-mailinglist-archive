Looking through the JUnit code, I seem to have propagated another \nurban myth.\n\nThat said, I always believed that the protocol says that setUp() and \nteardown() should be for administration of the test and that the \nbusiness of the test should be done within the test* methods. In the \njMock library, we have a VerifyingTestCase that overrides runBare() to \nsupport this approach.\n\nS.\n\nVincent Massol wrote:\n&gt; What&#39;s wrong with that? (happy to learn a new thing) :-)\n&gt; \n&gt; Steve mentioned in another email that the error do not get reported\n&gt; properly. Strange. It has always worked for me with either easymock or\n&gt; dynamocks.\n&gt; \n&gt; That it is now automatic in jmock is of course much better.\n\n\n",
