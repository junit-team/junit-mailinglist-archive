But in either case the brittle<br/>\nhack remains to do the delegation from SlowSelector.class or<br/>\nGroupSelectionRunner.class as the case may be to the actual runner<br/>\nthat will do the work, when the correct runner isn&#39;t obvious (JUnit3,<br/>\n4, or perhaps it should be ignored, etc.)<br/>\n<br/>\nYou suggestion solves the next problem, of how to segregate the<br/>\nmultiple types of tests, which is certainly appreciated.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a>, Malte Finsterwalder &lt;malte@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I didn&#39;t think it through as much as you did obviously.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I just thought that it might be easier to have a generic Runner-class.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; When I understood you correctly you would do<br/>\n&gt; @RunWith(SlowSelector.class)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; another test class has:<br/>\n&gt; @RunWith(InContainerSelector.class)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; and so on...<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I was thinking of something like:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; @RunWith(GroupSelectionRunner.class)<br/>\n&gt; @Group(&quot;slow&quot;);<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; and another test class would be annotated with<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; @RunWith(GroupSelectionRunner.class)<br/>\n&gt; @Group(&quot;in-container&quot;);<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The GroupSelectionRunner would look for the Group-annotation and look<br/>\n&gt; for the according property in the environment or something like that.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Do you now understand, what I mean?<br/>\n&gt; It&#39;s just off the top of my head.

I suppose we could start looking at a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; custom Request object that returns a runner that is never intended to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; be used with the @RunWith annotation, but rather delegates run<br/>\n&gt; &gt; building on each class. But I&#39;m not sure that IDEA or ant support a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; custom Request object, or how you would get them to use it.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a>, Malte Finsterwalder &lt;malte@&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; yme0987654321 wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; In answer to your second question, basically the slow tests<br/>\nwould run<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; at check in, or during the general build process, whereas the fast<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; test would just be part of the TDD of making sure everything is<br/>\ngreen.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; For point of comparison, the slow tests are currently 1/2 hour for<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; less than 100, and the fast tests are under 60 seconds, even though<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; there are about 700 of them.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; I understand that reasoning.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; But as you said you want to have several categories:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; DB-Tests, In Container Tests, ...<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Maybe you should create a runner hat can be parameterized to<br/>\nhandle all<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; these cases?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; And how do you setup the runtime, so that it does run the tests<br/>\nor does<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; not run the tests on a per run basis?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Setting a system property seams cumbersome to me.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; That&#39;s ok for the server, but sometimes I want to run the slow<br/>\ntests on<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; my desktop too, don&#39;t I?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Maybe we can come up with something better?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Greetings,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;    Malte<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; ------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Yahoo!
