At<br/>\nthat time I suggested some search engine terms that could bring you<br/>\ninformation. Did you try those? I seem to recall quite a few good<br/>\nJUnit tutorials available on the web and I&#39;d be very surprised if<br/>\nthere weren&#39;t good tutorials forHtmlUnit also. As you were very<br/>\ninterested in HtmlUnit, did you try asking questions on their mailing<br/>\nlist? Have you tried the JUnit FAQ?<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://junit.sourceforge.net/doc/faq/faq.htm\">http://junit.sourceforge.net/doc/faq/faq.htm</a><br/>\n<br/>\nIf you have an error that you don&#39;t understand, have you tried<br/>\nreducing the code down to the simplest possible state and seeing if<br/>\nthat works?<br/>\n<br/>\nI suggest that you read Eric Raymond&#39;s guide to asking questions as<br/>\nyou have provided no actual information to help us help you. Trying to<br/>\nsend attached JAR files of JUnit and HtmlUnit won&#39;t help as we most<br/>\nlikely all already have those and the mailing list server will reject<br/>\nthem.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html\">http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\nWhat versions are you trying to use? What version of Java do you have<br/>\ninstalled? What operating system are you using? We now know that you<br/>\nare using Eclipse, but which version? Is the error in your test or is<br/>\nthe error in your code that you are testing, or both? Consider posting<br/>\na fragment of code that is giving you problems and you&#39;ll stand a much<br/>\nbetter chance of receiving help.<br/>\n<br/>\nSimon<br/>\n(One of the JUnit mailing list moderators)<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nsimonpeter.org | simonpeter.com | newlife-upc.org | wisconsindistrictnews.org</div>",
