In our organisation\n&gt; testing is evolving. Additionally there is a common\n&gt; problem of Devlopment Vs Testing arguments. In any\n&gt; regression round if a new bug comes in then the issue\n&gt; raised will be why this bug was not identified in\n&gt; previous round though it will be fixed later.\n\nI have found that determining the reasons why a particular bug made it\nthrough a test cycle need not be complex or formal beyond having a tester\n(be they developer or dedicated tester) consider the cause of the bug and\nadd it to their test suite. As time progresses testing patterns evolve -\nsome may be general patterns that apply to most testing efforts, some may\nonly apply to a specific codebase - but I don&#39;t think to much consideration\nshould be given to post mortems of single bugs. Once a project or at least a\nmilestone is over, then maybe a given set of or class of bugs could be post\nmortemed and both coding practices and test suites updated/adjusted.\n\n&gt; We thought over and looked into the possibility of\n&gt; checking effectiveness of testing.\n\nI think such things as coverage metrics and overall number of bugs (or their\nseverity) will tell you more about test effectiveness than looking at\nindividual bugs that make it past a testing effort.\n\n&gt; As the process is still evolving Testing gets less amount of inputs ...\n&gt; in all sense - time, resource, documents, functional\n&gt; training... !\n\nI am not sure what you are saying here. As processes evolve testing should\nrequire less information input as the requirements become clearer and more\nspecific, but probably more resources (everybody, developers and testers\nalike, underestimate resource allotments).\n\n&gt;\n&gt; My question is, in such constraints how one can\n&gt; measure and control the effectiveness of Testing?\n\nI more or less covered it in my first post.\n\n&gt; This is typically for Manual Testing. The issue of\n&gt; Automated Testing remains apart ... :)\n&gt;\n\nIf you mean automated unit testing, then I don&#39;t think that is very much\ndifferent than manual unit testing in nature; the latter eventually becomes\nthat latter. If you mean system or GUI testing, then that is a different\nissue and probably a bit off-topic for this list, but I have found that the\nearlier you test (TDD and/or unit testing), the more manageable &quot;manual&quot;\ntesting (anything that can&#39;t be automated) becomes.\n\nFWIW,\nLauren\n\n=====\nLooking for an experienced Java/C++ Software Engineer?\nSee: http://developerdude.mystarband.net/resume.html\n\n\n\n",
