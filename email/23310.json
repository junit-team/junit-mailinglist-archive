I tagged<br/>\nthe rest with:<br/>\n- regression bugs (9): there was an implementation of the feature that<br/>\nworked prior to the 4.9 beta (although potentially earlier than<br/>\n4.8.x))<br/>\n- nonregression bugs (15): it is likely the feature has always failed<br/>\nin the documented way.<br/>\n- features (~95): additions to the (implicit) spec, with<br/>\nimplementations to provide the additions.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks to everyone who has been submitting problems, proposals, and<br/>\npatches.  I&#39;m sorry that some of you have been waiting so long for a<br/>\nresponse.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe next part of the development plan, in order:<br/>\n<br/>\n- Fix the regression bugs<br/>\n- Release a 4.9 beta 3<br/>\n- Hopefully 4.9b3 can become the final release.  (I am not planning<br/>\nany nonregression bug fixes or new features to get into the 4.9<br/>\nrelease.  We need to steer this ship back toward frequent releases.)<br/>\n- Create a github project for junit.contrib.<br/>\n- Go through the backlog of pull requests, to see which can be<br/>\naccepted as is, and which either need changes, or should be redirected<br/>\ninto junit.contrib.<br/>\n- Work through non-regression bugs for further releases in the 4.9.x series<br/>\n- Choose a number of highly-rated feature requests to be the scope for<br/>\n4.10, and begin (patch acceptance / implementation)<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m excited to see this project keep moving forward,<br/>\n<br/>\n   David Saff</div>",
