So, I threw =\r\ncaution to the wind and submitted not only\nmethods that did X, but unit tes=\r\nts to ensure that the method really did do\nmy best understanding of X.\n\nTwo=\r\n of my three previous employers had zero unit tests in-house when I\nstepped=\r\n through the door. In both of them, I wrote the first tests and\nstarted try=\r\ning to share the vision of tested code being somewhere that bugs\ncan&#39;t hide=\r\n. It&#39;s hard work.\n\nUnit testing should be a &quot;no-brainer&quot;, but I find that i=\r\nt&#39;s still treated\npoorly within corporations.\n\nSimon\n\n\nOn Wed, May 5, 2010 =\r\nat 6:25 PM, Bradley, Todd &lt;todd.bradley@...&gt;wrote:\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Mike, thi=\r\ns is such a great topic you&#39;ve stumbled on. Where I work, we are\n&gt; doing lo=\r\nts of hiring this year. Every development engineer candidate that\n&gt; comes i=\r\nn gets to do at least two programming problems on the board. For one\n&gt; of t=\r\nhe problems, the question is something like, &quot;Write a function in any\n&gt; lan=\r\nguage you want (except Perl) to do XXX.&quot; And then once they have that, we\n&gt;=\r\n ask them to tell us how they&#39;d unit test what they just wrote.\n&gt;\n&gt; It&#39;s a =\r\nrare individual that says, &quot;Damn, now I realize I should have\n&gt; written the=\r\n unit test FIRST!&quot; And out of probably 100 candidates in the past\n&gt; few yea=\r\nrs of this approach, not a single candidate has ever actually written\n&gt; a J=\r\nUnit/NUnit/whatever test case first. But I hold out hope that person will\n&gt;=\r\n someday grace our interview room.\n&gt;\n&gt; Cheers,\n&gt; Todd.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; -----Origina=\r\nl Message-----\n&gt; From: junit@yahoogroups.com &lt;junit%40yahoogroups.com&gt; [mai=\r\nlto:\n&gt; junit@yahoogroups.com &lt;junit%40yahoogroups.com&gt;] On Behalf Of Mike\n&gt;=\r\n Forsberg\n&gt; Sent: Monday, May 03, 2010 10:24 AM\n&gt; To: junit@yahoogroups.com=\r\n &lt;junit%40yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; Subject: Re: [junit] When it matters most, don=\r\n&#39;t forget your tests.\n&gt;\n&gt; Thank you to all those that responded.\n&gt;\n&gt; I agre=\r\ne that if a candidate spends all their time on the simple error cases\n&gt; the=\r\nn they don&#39;t understand TDD.\n&gt;\n&gt; I think a pair programming environment wou=\r\nld be ideal for an interview.\n&gt; Maybe actually have the candidate solve an =\r\nactual problem you&#39;re solving.\n&gt; This may sound like it may take a lot of t=\r\nime, but I&#39;d rather be part of a\n&gt; team that can spend 1-2 hours writing co=\r\nde in an interview, then waste that\n&gt; time on soft silks. If the candidate =\r\ncomplains that it&#39;s not their\n&gt; IDE/editor of choice, that should send up a=\r\n flag. Granted this is my ideal\n&gt; environment.\n&gt;\n&gt; What about a 2 stage int=\r\nerview? One where they write the tests for a\n&gt; already\n&gt; existing piece of =\r\ncode (maybe to increase the codes functionality), then\n&gt; another where they=\r\n try and write code to get the tests to pass. Granted\n&gt; this is not testing=\r\n if they actually use TDD, but it would show if they\n&gt; have\n&gt; the skill. Ma=\r\nybe forcing the iteration process of test -&gt; functionality -&gt;\n&gt; test -&gt; fun=\r\nctionality will show if they have the skill.\n&gt;\n&gt; I think spending some time=\r\n, 2-3 hours with a machine, later in the\n&gt; interview\n&gt; process, say after a=\r\n phone screen, maybe second round of face to face,\n&gt; might\n&gt; pay dividends =\r\nin the quality of people on a team. Then again it might\n&gt; depend on how ski=\r\nlled you need this individual to be.\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks for the input,\n&gt;\n&gt; Big Mike=\r\n\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt;\n&gt; --=\r\n----------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
