It=\r\n doesn&#39;t have any way of knowing the environment that it&#39;s \n&gt; running in, o=\r\nr the environment that the test needs.\n\nI prefer the idea of well designed =\r\ncode that makes it easy to substitute\nthe /environment/ for a MockObject &lt;w=\r\nww.mockobjects.com&gt; instead.  This,\nIMHO, is the true nature of *unit* test=\r\ns.  What you want to know is that\nyour code responds to the environment in =\r\nthe expected way.\n\nThus you create mock objets for a faulty database: metho=\r\nd call throws\nexception; a normal db call: the method returns a valid respo=\r\nnse; etc.\n\nThis gives you complete control over the responses you expect fr=\r\nom the\nenvironment, and allow you to test your code under expected conditio=\r\nns.\nIt also means that your unit test suite will be a lot faster.\n\nThere is=\r\n also a place for functional or acceptance tests.  These tests,\nlike integr=\r\nations tests, would be used to test that the different\ncomponents work as e=\r\nxpected when put together.  If these tests take\nlonger to run, you could sc=\r\nhedule them to run once every evening, or\nonce a week over the weekend, whi=\r\nle running the quicker performing unit\ntests every time you think of checki=\r\nng some code into Source/Version\ncontrol.\n\nManuel Amago.\nmailto:mamago@bigf=\r\noot.com\n\n\n",
