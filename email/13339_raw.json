The only class that has \na &quot;addListener(TestListener)&quot; method is class TestResult, which in turn \nwill be used by TestCase. Is this means, I have to code JDBC and XML \nparsing (I use XML for grade matching) for every testXXX method? That \nis absolutely not the one I&#39;d like to do. I prefer write a simple, \nusual code for JUnit, and write the complex code for grade matching in \nmy grading tool program (in button ActionListener perhaps). So what \nshould i do? \n\n&gt; \n&gt; Have you looked at the TestListener?\n&gt; \n&gt; -- \n&gt; Jason Rogers\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I,\n&gt; but Christ liveth in me: and the life which I now live in \n&gt; the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved \n&gt; me, and gave himself for me.&quot;\n&gt;     Galatians 2:20\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
