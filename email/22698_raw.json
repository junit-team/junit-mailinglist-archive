This provider uses=\r\n JUnitCore to run the tests and should (probably) support most of the &quot;mode=\r\nrn&quot; junit features.\n\nThe &quot;thing&quot; is that the JunitCore provider can be acti=\r\nvated even for non-parallel tests by adding the following to your configura=\r\ntion:\n\n&lt;parallel&gt;none&lt;/parallel&gt;\n\nThis will force the use of the new provid=\r\ner in serial mode, which is fine if you just want to get access to more mod=\r\nern junit features.\n\nPlease note that right now you need to use 2.6-SNAPSHO=\r\nT of surefire to get the latest version of the JunitCore provider.  Which i=\r\ns really the reason I&#39;m writing this: I&#39;m about to release a bug-fix releas=\r\ne of surefire (which will probably be called 2.5.1). I do not personally ha=\r\nve time to test all the &quot;new&quot; junit features with the new provider, but if =\r\nanyone here has time/interest in this I can get it included in the official=\r\n surefire documentation. \n\n\n\n\n\n",
