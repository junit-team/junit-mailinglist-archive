Couldn&#39;t you just &#39;diff&#39; them (assumin=\r\ng your on a nice *nix system; I guess on Windows you need to resort to WinD=\r\niff) or is there something I don&#39;t understand about the problem\n   diff -bw=\r\n ReportA ReportB \nshould do the trick.  You&#39;ll get differences between them=\r\n if the running times of tests are different but the serious differences sh=\r\nould be obvious.\n\nAre you going to asses the differences visually or is thi=\r\ns going to be in a script; if the latter, the problem is more interesting (=\r\ni.e. harder).\n\nHope this helps\n\njim\n\n--- In junit@yahoogroups.com, &quot;rohitku=\r\nlkarni15&quot; &lt;rohitkulkarni15@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi,\n&gt; \n&gt; Currently, I have a req=\r\nuirement of comparing results of two JUnit reports(with same set of tests).=\r\n\n&gt; The result of this comparison activity should be to generate a diff repo=\r\nrt that mentions only those tests whose status is different as compared to =\r\nthe 1st result\n&gt; \n&gt; i.e. If i have report A and report B, how to get the li=\r\nst of differences between these two reports.\n&gt; \n&gt; Can someone please guide =\r\nme on how to do this?\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt; Rohit\n&gt;\n\n\n\n",
