But what happens whe=\r\nn you may be expecting different\nexceptions in different parts of the test,=\r\n for example let=B4s say you\nwant to connect to a database so first you tes=\r\nt with a bad connection\nstring and you are expecting a SQLException. Then y=\r\nou test with other\nconnection string and you are not expecting that excepti=\r\non but a\nsuccesful connection instead.\n\nThis usually would mean that you ha=\r\nve to write two test cases one for\nthe expected exception and one for the s=\r\nuccessful connection right?\n\nBut what if:\n\ntry\n{\n    connection =3D DriverM=\r\nanager.getConnection(badConnString);\n    fail(&quot;SQLException Expected but wa=\r\ns not thrown&quot;);\n}\ncatch(SQLException sEx) { }\n\ntry\n{\n    connection =3D Dri=\r\nverManager.getConnection(goodConnString);\n}\ncatch(SQLException sEx)\n{\n    f=\r\nail(SQLException was not expected but was thrown&quot;);\n}\n\n----\nIs this a valid=\r\n practice or should be avoided? Would you say that is\nbetter to write separ=\r\nate test cases?\n\n\n",
