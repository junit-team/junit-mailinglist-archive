    "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1721454132\">We did 2 things to address test data and databases.  1.  We extended <br/>\nJunit to be feed runtime parameters and test data variables by an XML <br/>\nfile.  We use this extensively and it really helps so we don&#39;t have <br/>\nto hard code test data into our TestCase classes--we just call <br/>\ngetTestVariable(String name) which is in the parent of all of our <br/>\nTestCases.  And the second thing I just put in, but we are not really <br/>\nusing much yet--I added variables to the XML file to set a SQL script <br/>\nand refresh flag to run the script against the database either once <br/>\nfor the entire TestSuite or before each Test in the Suite.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am new to the group if anybody is interested in the code let me <br/>\nknow how to post it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\nPete Gordon<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In junit@y..., Jim Cheesman &lt;jchees@m...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; At 07:02 PM 4/25/2001, you wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;I have played with junit and also written crude testing frameworks.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;I am currently working with a project that interfaces with PVCS <br/>\nVersion<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Manager.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;When I run my test, I try to checkout/check in files, but whenever <br/>\nI run my<br/>\n&gt; &gt;test suite<br/>\n&gt; &gt;I need to delete all the subfolders and copy them from a backup so <br/>\nI can be<br/>\n&gt; &gt;in a known state<br/>\n&gt; &gt;I also have to have the user check in version manager if the file <br/>\nactually<br/>\n&gt; &gt;got checkedin/checkout<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; You could use ant (http://jakarta.apache.org) to do the check <br/>\nin/out <br/>\n&gt; procedure - one of its built-in tasks is Cvs. As for setting up the <br/>\ndata, <br/>\n&gt; simple tasks like copying test data to/from directories, cleaning <br/>\n&gt; directories etc. is also easy to setup. (I haven&#39;t used the cvs <br/>\ntask - we <br/>\n&gt; have Source Safe here, but I don&#39;t suppose that it&#39;s too difficult <br/>\nto set up.)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; If you&#39;re using a database, as you almost certainly are, things get <br/>\nmore <br/>\n&gt; complicated ;) Some possible options:<br/>\n&gt; * Someone here (I forget who) posted a &quot;MockResultSet&quot; class that <br/>\ncan be <br/>\n&gt; used to fake database results - I think it&#39;s available on the Yahoo <br/>\ngroups <br/>\n&gt; web page somewhere.<br/>\n&gt; * You could set up a script (also executed by ant?) that creates <br/>\nsome fake <br/>\n&gt; tables in your database and populates them with data, which you <br/>\ncould then <br/>\n&gt; test against. (You have got a test database, right?) Once the tests <br/>\nhave <br/>\n&gt; been run, you could then execute a seperate script to clean up.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; If anyone has any other suggestions I&#39;d love to hear them - this is <br/>\na <br/>\n&gt; problem that I&#39;ve come up against more than once...<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; (If you decide to use ant, and are not sure how to use it, feel <br/>\nfree to <br/>\n&gt; mail me).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; HTH,<br/>\n&gt; Jim<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;                            *   Jim Cheesman   *<br/>\n&gt;              Trabajo: <br/>\n&gt; jchees@m... - (34)(91) 724 9200 x 2360<br/>\n&gt;                Personal: <br/>\n&gt; mogrim@a...
