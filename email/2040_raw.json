We believe this will make the session more generally\ninteresting to a larger group of the attendees.\n\nAlong with the topic change, we have opened up the panel to include\nother folks from the industry with XP adoption experience, in\naddition to the original panelists from Escrow.com.  We believe this\nwill provide the session attendees with access to a wider range of\nopinions and experiences.\n\nWe&#39;d love to have you attend.  We believe there will be some great\ndiscussions of the challenges and successes of adopting XP.  If\nyou&#39;re considering adopting XP, you can pick up some tips from folks\nwho have been through it.  If you&#39;ve adopted XP, it&#39;s a chance to\nshare your experiences as well as compare your experiences to others.\n\nIf you&#39;re interested in participating as a panelist, please contact\nme directly.\n\n-Paul Hodgetts\nprh@...\n\n\n",
