In those cases my *first* look would be at wether the design can\nbenefit from moving the method. I didn&#39;t even say that I&#39;d always do it,\njust that I can&#39;t remember an instance where there design didn&#39;t improve\nwhen I did.\n\nHope this explains my view a little bit better...\n\nCheers, Ilja\n\n\n",
