You \nmight as well read tea leaves.\n\n&gt; And it also blows up the size of the compiled code without use.\n\nAre you guessing again?\n\n&gt; At\n&gt;  least for code to be transmitted over the Internet (e.g. by Java Web\n&gt;  Start or in Applets) this should be avoided too.\n\nWho cares after compression if it&#39;s 10k or 12k? Or 100k or 110k?\n \n&gt; Without conditional compilation there is no other way than commenting\n&gt;  out the hundreds of assertions manually - not really realistic. This\n&gt;  keeps me from using standard test frameworks in my own projects.\n\nDo you mean you prefer performance over correctness?\n \n&gt; In my own logger I have such a global boolean flag to disable test code\n&gt;  generation.  But this also can not stop those message String\n&gt;  concatenations because these are done before passing the resulting\n&gt;  String to the internally disabled assertTrue(message, ok) method.\n\nThat sends up a bunch of red flags:\n- your own logger -- nothing else is good enough, you have to write your \nown?\n- disable test code -- do you mix test code and production code?\n- you&#39;re worried about test performance but didn&#39;t profile?\n\n&gt; Would it be technically impossible to solve this through an annotation\n&gt;  like e.g. @EnableTestCodeGeneration? Annotations are recognized at\n&gt;  compile time.\n\nSince you already wrote your own logger, why not write your own \npreprocessor?\nPlease let us know how many nano seconds of performance you could squeeze \nout of your production tests.\n\nRobert\n\n",
