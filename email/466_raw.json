I want to use JUnit to test a function which operates on the\ninput, and compare the output of the function with the expected output\nfor each test data pair.\n\nI can easily write a test method which will iterate over the test data,\nbut as soon as one piece of test data causes a test failure the test\nwill terminate.  I wish to have a separate JUnit test executed for each\nline of test data, which will generate information on the proportion of\ntest data instances passed and failed (instead of the current situation,\nwhere I only know whether the entire test data set has passed or\nfailed).  In other words, whenever the function fails on a line of test\ndata, I want to increment the failure count, while continuing on to\ncheck all the other lines of test data.\n\nThe only idea that has occurred to me is to write a small program that\nwill generate a JUnit test class based on the test data: that is, it\nwill generate one test function per line of input.  This seems\ninefficient in terms of code size (I have many thousands of test\ninstances already, and may have several million in the longer term).\n\nJUnit is being used throughout the project, so I want to use JUnit for\nthis testing if possible.\n\nCan anyone suggest a way to get this working?\n\nThanks,\nLyndon\n\n\n\nTo unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\njunit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n\n\n",
