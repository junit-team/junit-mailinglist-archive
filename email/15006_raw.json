The developers add methods to these classes continuously. All\n&gt; test classes are combined in a testsuite, which runs with\n&gt; junit.textui.TestRunner in a batch script.\n&gt; \n&gt; What I would need to see in the output of that script is the name of\n&gt; each test method which was executed. I want to avoid, that each method\n&gt; should printout its name, but solve it automatically.\n&gt; \n&gt; What could I do here?\n\n_JUnit Recipes_ has a specific recipe on this topic, which I have \nuploaded to the file section of this list. If the recipe helps you, then \nbuy the book!\n\nTake care.\n-- \nJ. B.
