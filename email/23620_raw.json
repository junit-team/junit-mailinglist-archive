This is a pain for me, as well.\n\nSourceforge.net is purely vestigial.=\r\n  The moment there&#39;s a great,\nauthoritative master location to link to, I&#39;l=\r\nl do what it takes to\nkill sourceforge and point it there.\n\njunit.org is an=\r\n oddity.  For reasons that predate me and I only dimly\nunderstand, junit.or=\r\ng was registered back in 2000 by Object Mentor.\nTo my knowledge, it has nev=\r\ner been actively maintained by any of the\nactive maintainers of the JUnit s=\r\nource.  The site currently there\n(developed by Ben Rady and a merry crew ro=\r\nughly four years ago) is one\nof the better incarnations of the site.  Howev=\r\ner, its design\npresupposed that the junit.org site itself would serve as an=\r\n active\ncommunity, and I think that never fully materialized, with this\nmai=\r\nling list and, now, github, being the main points of vibrancy.\n\nTo me, I th=\r\nink the ultimate solution would be a site accessible at\nhttp://junit.org, b=\r\nacked by github pages at\nhttp://junit-team.github.com/, making available a =\r\nsuperset of the\ninformation available at the current junit.org site.  I&#39;d h=\r\nave to talk\nto a couple of stakeholders to see if this can be made to happe=\r\nn.\n\n   David Saff\n\nOn Thu, Sep 8, 2011 at 5:43 PM, Stefan Birkner &lt;mail@ste=\r\nfan-birkner.de&gt; wrote:\n&gt; The information about JUnit is across three differ=\r\nent places: junit.org, junit.sourceforge.net and github.

IMHO the github pages are a good place for t=\r\nhe JUnit documentation, because we can use all the git(hub) features for cr=\r\neating the documentation.\n&gt;\n&gt; What do you think?\n&gt;\n&gt; Stefan Birkner\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
