What if I have a class that has a =\r\nsmall section of code that is repeated constantly in the class. The way I w=\r\nas taught back in the day was to pull that section code out and make it a p=\r\nrivate member to enhance code readability and security (singular updates).\n=\r\n\tThis code snipped is not really suitable for an interface. Likewise it sho=\r\nuld not be made a public class simply because it is only a bit of code redu=\r\nction. We have a section of code that assembles a filepath string based upo=\r\nn some parameters given and its own given values. Its not a big method, but=\r\n it does a bit of simple logic and string concats. However, we put it in it=\r\ns own method so that when changes occur (and they have over time) that we o=\r\nnly need to update one spot; thus avoiding the problems with changes not be=\r\ning carried through to all applicable sections.\n\n\nclass foo {\n\n\tpublic meth=\r\nod_1(String param1) {\n\t\t// some tasks\n\t\tString value =3D repeatMethod(newVa=\r\nri);\n\t\t// some tasks\n\t}\n\n\tpublic method_2(String param1) {\n\t\t// some tasks\n=\r\n\t\tString value =3D repeatMethod(newVari);\n\t\t// some tasks\t}\n\n\t...&lt;snip&gt;...\n=\r\n\n\tpublic method_n(String param1) {\n\t\t// some tasks\n\t\tString value =3D repea=\r\ntMethod(newVari);\n\t\t// some tasks\n\t}\n\n\tprivate String repeatMethod(String n=\r\newVari) {\n\t\t// some tasks\n\t\treturn anotherVari;\n\t}\n\n\n}\n\n\nChip\n-----\n&quot;I&#39;m su=\r\nre looters don&#39;t call it looting.

It is defined like\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; class xmlInfo{\n&gt;  =\r\n&gt; &gt; //\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; //\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; }.\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; When I try running the test, it gives me =\r\nerror that I cannot\n&gt; access\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; the class. I think something is related=\r\n to packge protection.. I\n&gt; was\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; wondering if this problem could be s=\r\nolved too..\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; Yes. Make the class public.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Hey..\n&gt; Thanks a =\r\nlot.. I appreciate the help. I am not the developer of the\n&gt; xmlInfo.. I am=\r\n just the tester of the entire application and the\n&gt; developers have made t=\r\nhat it in such a way that no one can access\n&gt; it. So, I think the only way =\r\nthat can be tested is if i put my\n&gt; testclass is the samepackage with xmlin=\r\nfo.. Is that right?.. I\n&gt; cannot make the class xmlInfo public. It is out o=\r\nf my reach..\n\nThe usual assumption is that you&#39;re testing code you can chan=\r\nge, so the \nusual advice will be to change to code to make it easier to tes=\r\nt.\n\nAsk the developers what their concern is about client code being able t=\r\no \naccess their classes. Maybe they have nothing to worry about. Beyond \nth=\r\nat, they ought to consider using Interface Segregation instead of the \ndrea=\r\nded visibility keywords.\n\nIf the class is package-visible, then placing the=\r\n tests in the same \npackage -- even if in a different source tree -- will d=\r\no. It&#39;s not my \nfavorite solution, but it will do.\n-- \nJ. B.
