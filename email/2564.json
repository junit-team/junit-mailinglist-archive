In my environment, running each test is very <br/>\nexpensive, so I want to get the most out of it as possible.  If the <br/>\nassertion failure means the rest of my assertions aren&#39;t run, I&#39;m <br/>\nmissing a lot of information.  Initially, I broke them all up into <br/>\nseparate tests, but that proved to be clumsy, so I modified the code to <br/>\nallow for multiple failures (basically, a failed assertion wouldn&#39;t <br/>\nthrow an exception, it would simply be added to the TestResults <br/>\nfailures), and writing the tests proved much easier and provided much <br/>\nmore information than previously available.<br/>\n<br/>\n-shane<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Monday, September 3, 2001, at 12:14  PM, Laurent Duperval wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; On  1 Sep, J.

What&#39;s the diff?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; I&#39;d like a way to make<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; the test fail for every parameter that is missing and consider each <br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; of the<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; iterations as one test.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Silly question: why? Does it matter whether one, two or ten parameters <br/>\n&gt;&gt; are<br/>\n&gt;&gt; not handled correctly? I think it matters more whether they are all<br/>\n&gt;&gt; handled correctly, or not.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; It does but the fact that one parameter fails may have nothing to do <br/>\n&gt; with<br/>\n&gt; the fact that another fails since validation may be occuring in <br/>\n&gt; different<br/>\n&gt; parts of the code. By failing once per invalid parameter, you are<br/>\n&gt; immediately pointed to the proper place to debug. And if the test lists <br/>\n&gt; all<br/>\n&gt; the parameters that failed, a developer could possibly see a pattern, <br/>\n&gt; which<br/>\n&gt; also helps in debugging.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Also, who cares how many tests there are? Do you? Your manager? I don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt;&gt; want to get into the discussion again about counting tests, but I have<br/>\n&gt;&gt; never really cared how many tests I have, as long as I&#39;m happy with the<br/>\n&gt;&gt; quality of the tests.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; No, counting tests wasn&#39;t the motive behind my question.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Since JUnit counts test methods by default, you&#39;d need one method per<br/>\n&gt;&gt; parameter. Do you really think that&#39;s a useful thing to do? I don&#39;t.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; No, that&#39;s why I asked if there was a better method than what I&#39;m doing <br/>\n&gt; now:<br/>\n&gt; I have a StringBuffer to which I add all the parameters that failed and <br/>\n&gt; then<br/>\n&gt; use the StringBuffer in fail().<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; L<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --<br/>\n&gt; Laurent Duperval &lt;mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lduperval@...\">lduperval@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Why do we drive on parkways and park on driveways?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\">junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
