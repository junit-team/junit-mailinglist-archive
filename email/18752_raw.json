While the groups that are practicing Scrum are fairly\nadvanced and=\r\n use unit testing (some even do TDD), there is still a\nbroad community with=\r\nin our organisation that has never even considered\nUnit Testing/TDD (some e=\r\nven at the bottom of services stack).\n\nI&#39;m going to organize a series of lu=\r\nnch and learn sessions to workshop\nJ.B.&#39;s book and help make unit testing p=\r\nart of the everyday culture.\nTo kick this off I need a kick ass presentatio=\r\nn that will demonstrate\nthe value of TDD and Unit testing. The goal of the =\r\npresentation: sell\npeople on TDD and motivate people to spend 10-12 weeks w=\r\norkshopping\nthe book at lunch. I was wondering is anyone aware of any\nprese=\r\nntations that would make a good starting point? Or will I have to\nwrite my =\r\nown scratch?\n\nMy rough plan\n  - Discuss the benefits of Unit testing\n  - Wo=\r\nrk through a body of existing code, writing tests and\nrefactoring as we go =\r\n- demonstrating how unit tests can force us to\nsimplify our code.\n\nIn addit=\r\nion any pointers on how people organise sessions like this\nwould also help =\r\n- however I will try to make this as participant\ndriven as possible.\n\nWhat =\r\nare your favorite presentations? How have you organized lunch and\nlearn ses=\r\nsions?\n\nBTW I have googled on the subject and haven&#39;t found anything of gre=\r\nat\nquality. Before I sink several days of effort I thought I would ask you.=\r\n\n\nThanks\nMark Levison\nhttp://www.notesfromatooluser.com/\n\n\n",
