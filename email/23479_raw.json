Will be following your progress with interest. Regarding\nSB=\r\nT, there is the ~test-quick action that attempts to run only the tests\nrele=\r\nvant for what you have changed (my interpretation from using it, don&#39;t\nknow=\r\n /exactly/ how it optimizes). It seems SBT has quite excellent\ndependency a=\r\nnalysis that allows for these kinds of features.\n\nAlso, SBT&#39;s console reall=\r\ny is such an obvious thing to do given hot spot\noptimizers etc so it&#39;s almo=\r\nst weird that maven, ant et al did not do this.\nWhy wouldn&#39;t one keep the b=\r\nuild/test-tool running? (given how long it takes\nto start a JVM and how muc=\r\nh things can accelerate once the hotspot kicks in\nand does it&#39;s magic; usua=\r\nlly several seconds into execution if I understand\nthings correctly). I\ns t=\r\nhis what you are after with class loader caching? to be able to keep a\nJVM-=\r\ninstance running over time and just swap in changed classes?\n\n\n------------=\r\n-----------------------------------------\nJoakim Ohlrogge\nAgical AB\nV=E4ste=\r\nrl=E5nggatan 79, 2 tr\n111 29 Stockholm, SWEDEN\n\nMobile: +46-708-754004\nBlog=\r\n: johlrogge.wordpress.com\nTwitter: @johlrogge\nE-mail: joakim.ohlrogge@agica=\r\nl.se\n\n\nOn Thu, Jun 23, 2011 at 1:36 PM, Esko Luontola &lt;esko.luontola@gmail.=\r\ncom&gt;wrote:\n\n&gt; **\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Joakim Ohlrogge wrote on 23.6.2011 11:48:\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; I th=\r\nink this is where my idea was different. I planned to delegate the\n&gt; &gt; runn=\r\ning completely to other frameworks and just be flexible about what\n&gt; they\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; can report back. So it becomes more of a presentation-issue (it seems to=\r\n\n&gt; me\n&gt; &gt; that you are also focusing on running the tests, especially being=\r\n clever\n&gt; &gt; about ordering the run sequence for high probability of catchin=\r\ng failing\n&gt; &gt; tests fast).\n&gt;\n&gt; Yes, I&#39;m focusing on running the tests. From=\r\n a testing framework&#39;s point\n&gt; of view, Jumi provides a similar interface a=\r\ns JUnit&#39;s @RunWith\n&gt; annotation and the related APIs.\n&gt;\n&gt; Jumi will also in=\r\nclude things such as test discovery and starting up the\n&gt; JVM instance, whi=\r\nch previously have been taken care of build tools and\n&gt; IDEs. There will al=\r\nso be a graphical UI, so that it would be usable even\n&gt; without IDE integra=\r\ntion. My goal is to solve some cross-cutting concerns\n&gt; which affect the fu=\r\nll tool chain of running tests. It will also try to\n&gt; minimize the small di=\r\nfferences between running tests in a build tool vs\n&gt; IDE, and protect from =\r\nthe effects of bugs in IDEs&#39; support for running\n&gt; tests (I&#39;ve encountered =\r\nmany such issues).\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; It also looks very promising with focus on perfo=\r\nrmance. Have you looked\n&gt; into\n&gt; &gt; incremental running al=E1 SBT or is that=\r\n left to tools like SBT?\n&gt;\n&gt; I know about SBT&#39;s incremental compiler. Does =\r\nit also do something smart\n&gt; related running tests?\n&gt;\n&gt; SBT and FSC were my=\r\n inspirations for class loader caching: Jumi will use\n&gt; a separate class lo=\r\nader for library JARs and cache it, so that when\n&gt; running tests there woul=\r\nd not be the overhead of loading a large\n&gt; library&#39;s classes (for example o=\r\nn my C2Q6600 it takes over 200ms to load\n&gt; Guice the first time). With Java=\r\n 6 and before, class loading is single\n&gt; threaded (Java 7 will have paralle=\r\nl classloading), so that has been a\n&gt; bottleneck for running tests in paral=\r\nlel.\n&gt;\n&gt; JUnit Max&#39;s way of reordering tests, so that those which fail the =\r\nmost\n&gt; likely are run first, is also one thing that I&#39;ll include. I have a\n=\r\n&gt; habit of waiting for the tests to finish executing before typing more,\n&gt; =\r\nso the UI will also give some feedback about when the\n&gt; most-likely-to-fail=\r\n tests have been run, so that I could resume typing\n&gt; faster. And running t=\r\nests in parallel is of course a must - finally some\n&gt; use for my 4 CPU core=\r\ns. :)\n&gt;\n&gt; The above optimizations are especially aimed for speeding up test=\r\n suites\n&gt; which run in a matter of seconds. If it takes 3 seconds to run al=\r\nl\n&gt; tests, a speedup of 0.5 seconds is big.\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;ll also provide something=\r\n for big companies which are full of mediocre\n&gt; developers writing slow tes=\r\nts. Running tests in a cluster is outside the\n&gt; scope of Jumi&#39;s core functi=\r\nonality, but I&#39;ll create a commercial plugin\n&gt; for that. (Who wouldn&#39;t want=\r\n to get a living from writing open source?\n&gt; ;) I&#39;m not sure how much runni=\r\nng tests in a cluster would speed up\n&gt; already fast test suites, because of=\r\n network latency, but I&#39;ll try and\n&gt; see what I can do about it.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; --\n&gt;=\r\n Esko Luontola\n&gt; www.orfjackal.net\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this mes=\r\nsage have been removed]\n\n\n",
