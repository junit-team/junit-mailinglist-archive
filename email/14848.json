Here&#39;s some of my <br/>\nthoughts on your thoughts:<br/>\n<br/>\nMariano Cortesi (Cono) wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; what if the parameters are not that easy to construct...?<br/>\n&gt; they are not plain type, but more complex classes...<br/>\n&gt; i could mock them or just populate them in some way.<br/>\n&gt; For example, one parameter could be a collection of things...<br/>\n&gt; so i would need to create and populate the collection<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>In this case, one might be better off not using the parameterized <br/>\nsyntax, but writing the tests individually.  Currently, there&#39;s nothing <br/>\nto stop you writing<br/>\n<br/>\n@Parameters public static int[][] data= computeComplicatedParameters();<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, the little IDE developer sitting on my other shoulder advises <br/>\nthat you think twice about not doing that, since it would mean having to <br/>\ndo a lot of computation before even knowing how many tests are too be run.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Another thing i see, is that...<br/>\n&gt; in one way, i like being able to see the test data with the test.<br/>\n&gt; but, i may have the necessity to have it outside (i.e. if i have many<br/>\n&gt; sets of test)<br/>\n&gt; so, i would be nice to have an alternative way to set the parameters.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Do you mean outside as in defined in another class, or outside as in <br/>\ndefined in a data file?  Have you written such a test in JUnit 3.x?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; One last though. Having all the parameters in an array could make me<br/>\n&gt; in some cases to forgot what that parameter is....they are not named <br/>\n&gt; after all..<br/>\n&gt; I don&#39;t know this is a real problem, it&#39;s simpler the way it is...<br/>\n&gt; but maybe if you have 5 o 6 parameters per testcase,<br/>\n&gt; then you could easily forgot which is which... (is this expression<br/>\n&gt; alright!??? :S)<br/>\n&gt; But, i repeat, this may not be a problem of the parameter test...<br/>\n&gt; maybe is the test that shouldn&#39;t need so many arguments...<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I lean toward your own response; it may be that a parameterized test <br/>\nthat needs 6 parameters could actually be several smaller tests.  <br/>\nMostly, there&#39;s no strong mechanism for named parameter passing in Java, <br/>\nso this scheme is no better and no worse than many consecutive calls to <br/>\nthe same method.  If you can think of an alternate syntax that solves <br/>\nthis issue, I&#39;m certainly interested.  Thanks,<br/>\n<br/>\n    David Saff</div>",
