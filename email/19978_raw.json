In my @BeforeClass I&#39;m\nstarting the RMI server as a Thread and=\r\n then my tests are calling\nmethods from the RMI server. The problem is comi=\r\nng from my server\ninitialization which check its config using the following=\r\n code:\n\nMyClass.class.class.getResource(&quot;resources/myConfig.conf&quot;);\n\nIt wor=\r\nks well when I don&#39;t Run the RMI server through Junit but when I\nrun it thr=\r\nough Junit (I call the Constructor of the RMI server in my\nJunit @BeforeCla=\r\nss), getResource returns null. I tried different ways\nbut all of them are r=\r\neturning null even if my sources and classes are\nin the classpath:\n-Thread.=\r\ncurrentThread().getContextClassLoader().getResource(&quot;resources/myConfig.con=\r\nf&quot;)\n-ClassLoader.getSystemClassLoader().getResource(&quot;resources/myConfig.con=\r\nf&quot;)\n\n\nOnce I read that when a ClassLoader was executing class done on the\nf=\r\nly (not a concrete class with a main, but like the Eclipse Junit\nclass wher=\r\ne Junit methods are linked to the Junit Test) it was not\npossible to get a =\r\nresource path to this class. Maybe it is the cause\nof my issue ?\n\nAny sugge=\r\nstion is welcome !\n\nThanks in advance and best regards.\n\nJo=EBl \n\n\n",
