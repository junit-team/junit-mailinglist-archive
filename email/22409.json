    "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-509972465\">Just to supplement myself somewhat;<br/>\n<br/>\nThe &quot;Computer&quot; architecture in Junit 4.7+ is open to extension, and the<br/>\nConfigurableParallelComputer provides the ability to run with a limited<br/>\nnumber of threads, as well<br/>\nas more efficient thread handling than the junit 4.7+<br/>\n&quot;ParallelComputer&quot;. Especially users of multi-module maven builds will<br/>\nfind the threading models in junit 4.7 ParallelComputer to be quite<br/>\nslow.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is a fairly decent unit test within<br/>\n&lt;http://%28http://github.com/krosenvold/configurable-parallel-computer/b&#92;<br/>\nlob/master/src/test/java/org/jdogma/junit/JUnitCorePerformanceTest.java#&#92;<br/>\nL83&gt;   ConfigurableParallelComputer that verifies the threading<br/>\nbehaviour of JunitCore combined with ConfigurableParallelComputer . I am<br/>\nnot sure if the same kind of test exists for ParallelComputer within<br/>\nJunit, but his test case could easily be extended to cover that as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nRemember that both surefire and ConfigurableParallelComputer contain<br/>\ndemultiplexing run listeners that make output appear in &quot;correct order&quot;<br/>\n(the one in ConfigurableParallelComputer being somewhat better than the<br/>\none in Surefire ATM)<br/>\n<br/>\nI always found in my own testing that the problem with &quot;methods&quot; is that<br/>\nthe run-time of the individual test methods is fairly small part of the<br/>\nentire test run-time (classloading and setup taking most of the time),<br/>\nand I have never been able to get much of a speed improvement out of<br/>\n&quot;methods&quot;. &quot;classes&quot; is also usually a lot safer & easier to get<br/>\nrunning. I  am reasonably sure that &quot;methods&quot; works in the<br/>\nsurefire-2.5+junit4.8.1+ConfigurableParallelComputer combination, but<br/>\nI&#39;ll definitiely accept surprises. Any specific issues should be filed<br/>\neither with ConfigurableParallelComputer at github or the apache<br/>\nsurefire issue tracker.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",
