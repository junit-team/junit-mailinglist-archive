I actually favour 100% code coverage, but I&#39;m going to put<br/>\nmy pragmatic hat on for now.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I&#39;m writing library or core system code, then it is vitally<br/>\nimportant that the code coverage be as close to 100% as possible.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I start at a new client and they have very few unit tests, I<br/>\nswitch into damage limitation/teaching mode and begin evangelising TDD<br/>\nand unit testing, even though the code coverage might be so low that<br/>\nit&#39;s laughable.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; In reality, we need to make compromises all the time and decide what part of<br/>\n&gt; our code we&#39;re not going to write tests for, so in effect, there *is* code<br/>\n&gt; that is too simple to be tested.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Pass-through methods are too simple to be tested on their own, but I<br/>\nbet if you really tried hard, it could be done. It&#39;s all about the<br/>\n&quot;want to&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; More specifically in this article, I&#39;m recommending that when you<br/>\n&gt; &gt; find a bug, you write a test for it first, even if the fix is obvious.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; The class in question had 100% code coverage before the bug was noticed.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   100% code coverage is practically a necessary but not sufficient<br/>\n&gt; &gt; condition for bug free code.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 100% code coverage is not just impossible to obtain and maintain, it&#39;s also<br/>\n&gt; deceptive and can make you think you are exercising your code in all<br/>\n&gt; possible ways.  Which is, of course, never true.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Never say never. You have dismissed an absolute statement with an<br/>\nabsolute statement. That only works in political ad campaigns. (and<br/>\nrebuttals to absolute statements :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n100% code-coverage _is_ possible and is _always_ a worthy goal. Are<br/>\nyou always going to hit it? No, but that doesn&#39;t mean that you don&#39;t<br/>\ntry. It&#39;s about trying.<br/>\n<br/>\nAn example from one of my hobbies: target shooting with a .22 rifle. I<br/>\nfind that when I use large targets (1 inch diameter bulls eye) I shoot<br/>\nat about upper 80&#39;s% accuracy. When I shoot with smaller targets (half<br/>\ninch bulls eye), I shoot with lower 90&#39;s% accuracy. This seems<br/>\ncounter-intuitive, but I&#39;ve done it often enough to know that it&#39;s<br/>\nconsistently true for me. The lesson that I have learned from this is<br/>\nthat the small target seems more difficult and so I try harder and<br/>\nsubsequently get a better result. The bigger target seems less of a<br/>\nchallenge, so I relax a little and my scores drop.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s a test you can try at home, even without a rifle: take a one<br/>\ninch orange circle and place it somewhere at about chest height and<br/>\nthen walk 100 yards away from it, turn around and see how it looks. I<br/>\nshoot with iron sights (that means no scope) and I get quite a few<br/>\n9&#39;s, 10&#39;s and bulls eyes at 100 yards. Just because the target looks<br/>\nvery difficult, doesn&#39;t mean that you can&#39;t hit it (pun intended)!<br/>\n<br/>\nIn big or difficult systems, 100% code-coverage may seem impossible on<br/>\nfirst consideration, but I&#39;d bet that if you applied yourself, you&#39;d<br/>\nget closer than if you just tell yourself it&#39;s impossible and not even<br/>\ntry for it.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Shoot for the moon ... land on the roof!&quot; to quote a former co-worker of mine.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; If I have to choose between bumping my code coverage from 90% to 91% and<br/>\n&gt; writing a test that will exercise a documented feature, I will pick the<br/>\n&gt; latter any day.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Any test is better than none. Some code _deserves_ more tests. See<br/>\nabove comment about libraries and core code.<br/>\n<br/>\nSimon<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nwww.simonpeter.org</div>",
