However, there *seems* to be an assumption in this thread <br/>\n&gt; that multilpe asserts per test are somehow related to each other, such <br/>\n&gt; that if one fails and I fix it then the other possibly failing asserts <br/>\n&gt; would be fixed at the same time.  That is not always, and perhaps <br/>\n&gt; generally, not the case.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I believe it is, if the test is focused on a small bit of functionality.<br/>\n\t<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Following is a simple, very contrived, example of applying a CreditMemo <br/>\n&gt; to a Sale and its associated RecurringSale.  This is merely an example <br/>\n&gt; to show that multiple asserts within a test are not related to each <br/>\n&gt; other such that fixing one would fix others, but the asserts are related <br/>\n&gt; to the general action of applying a CreditMemo to an Sale.<br/>\n\t<br/>\n </span></blockquote>(Example deleted for brevity)<br/>\n<br/>\nIs it necessary (or even desirable) to test both these things in the same<br/>\ntest?  Could you perhaps do one test to show applying the CreditMemo to a<br/>\nSale does the right thing, and a second to show applying it to a<br/>\nRecurringSale is correct?  If these two actions happen in different classes,<br/>\nwhy would you need to test them at the same time?<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJim McMaster<br/>\nmailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jim.mcmaster@...\">jim.mcmaster@...</a></div>",
