For\n&gt; example having\n&gt; a detailed log of the invoked methods (with parameters) should enable\n&gt; you to reproduce what happened.\n\nTo my knowledge, Exploratory Testing is performed at the GUI level, so\nthe tester would have to log widget events. Anyway, I once proposed this\nexact thing to some ET proponents.
