The user presses\nbuttons on the UI corresponding to methods on the component to see how the\nthreads interact with each other and with some blocking structure.\n\nA code snippet pane auto-highlights the relevant code as the threads do\ntheir thing.\n\nThe animations are written in Java and each animation is actually controlled\nby the underlying concurrent component it is illustrating. Therefore it\ndepicts the true run-time behavior of the component.\n\nI invite you to download the application, which is now hosted on SourceForge\nas an Open Source project.\nhttp://sourceforge.net/projects/javaconcurrenta/*&lt;\nhttp://sourceforge.net/projects/javaconcurrenta/&gt;\n\n\nI would greatly welcome any feedback from this list.\n\nMuch thanks\nVictor Grazi\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n",
