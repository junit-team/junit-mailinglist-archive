I don&#39;t have the energy to list all<br/>\n&gt; the problems with it, but I will point out that someone on this list<br/>\n&gt; wrote about 300 pages on bringing Java legacy code under test, including<br/>\n&gt; dozens of examples that cover the core of a J2EE application. What more<br/>\n&gt; do you need?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I never said it was not possible, I was just complaining about the way Agile<br/>\ndevelopers try to convince their audience.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for the &quot;sloppiest&quot; part, about forty people have commented on my post so<br/>\nfar, and a lot of them with experiences confirming my observations.  Maybe<br/>\nyou find it sloppy, but I suggest you look beyond the form, because there<br/>\nare obviously some real points in there...<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nCédric<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://testng.org\">http://testng.org</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",
