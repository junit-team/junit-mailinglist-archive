Usually, there is\n&gt; &gt; decomposition of the algorithm in the production class.\n&gt; &gt; Sometimes, I simply expose what might be thought of\n&gt; &gt; as private details. Sometimes, I can think of a better way\n&gt; &gt; to structure the problem, and am not worried about exposing\n&gt; &gt; the internals.  But sometimes, I really don&#39;t want to expose\n&gt; &gt; the internals to other production classes, but still want\n&gt; &gt; to be able to get at those points for testing.\n&gt;\n&gt; Would you not extract that functionality into another class and test it\n&gt; there?  And pass that (unit tested) code into your primary class?\n&gt;  That way\n&gt; do you not get the best of both worlds - and also the ability to plug in a\n&gt; new implementation as/when required?\n&gt;\n&gt; Jonathan\n&gt;\n\nAbsolutely, it comes back to the original class having more than one\nresponsibility.  That responsibility was hidden inside a private method, by\npulling it out into its own class we can UnitTest it directly, without the\nneed to break encapsulation, and we have a better class design.\n\n\n",
