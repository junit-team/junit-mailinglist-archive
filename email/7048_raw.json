It currently includes a runpath, a set of Suites and/or\n&gt; TestCases to run, and a list of Reporters ... you can save recipes in\n&gt; files, put shortcuts to those files as icons on your desktop, then\n&gt; double click on the icons to run the tests.\n&gt;\n&gt; By next week, though, I expect to add the notion of context properties\n&gt; to the recipe...\n\nCool. Might context properties include a pointer to test data, as well?\n\n&gt; There&#39;s also a testdrivendevelopment Yahoo group:\n&gt;\n&gt; http://groups.yahoo.com/group/testdrivendevelopment/\n\nI&#39;m on it, and still looking for the light bulb to go on.

(That concept\npretty well sold me on the concept of testability in the first place --\nboth to allow such laboratories, and to provide pre-defined\n&quot;experiments&quot; that show how things work.)\n\n\n\n\n",
