I would either use your method of a loop or generate a method that\ntakes parameters and then make tests that call this method depending on\nthe number of tests I need to do.  Another thing I do in the loops\napproach is write a more detailed label for the assertEquals.  Where you\nhave &quot;diff&quot;, you could write &quot;element &quot;+i+&quot; diff&quot; to help you pinpoint\neasier at what point in the array the error occured.  Basically the\ndifference is that the separate tests approach below will run all the\ntests if it encounters errors but the loop way will stop at the first\nfailure.\n\nCheers,\nRob.\n\ntestA()\n{\n  testXX(5,7);\n}\n\ntestB()\n{\n  testXX(7,4);\n}\n\ntestXX(int exp,int in){\n  out=myFunction(in);\n  assertEquals(&quot;diff&quot;,exp, out);\n}\n\nNagy Andrea wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; Hi All!\n&gt; \n&gt;         We are trying to set up JUnit for functional testing in our project.\n&gt; \n&gt;         Could you suggest some solutions for the following problem or refer\n&gt; me to some earlier postings.\n&gt; \n&gt;         I would like to do the following:\n&gt;         I have a function that I want to call with different parameters.\n&gt;         How is it possible to get the result of each run separately\n&gt; \n&gt;         1.\n&gt;         testXX(){\n&gt; \n&gt;                 out1=myFunction(in1);\n&gt;                 assertEquals(&quot;diff&quot;,expectedout1, out1);\n&gt;         }\n&gt;         2.\n&gt;         And I have a list of theses in1 and expectedout1 things.\n&gt; \n&gt;         how could  I combine both these features into a testcase?\n&gt;         Does it make sense at all?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;         All I could imagine was the following thing, but it seems to\n&gt; contradict the paradigm to keep your tests simple and small.\n&gt; \n&gt;         testXX(){\n&gt;                 for (i=0;i&lt; out.size(i);i++){\n&gt;                         out[i]=myFunction(in[i]);\n&gt;                         assertEquals(&quot;diff&quot;,expectedout[i], out[i]);\n&gt;                 }\n&gt;         }\n&gt; \n&gt;         Any comments will be much appretiated.\n&gt;                 Nagy Andrea\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
