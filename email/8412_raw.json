I tried searching the archives, but found \n&gt; nothing applicable. If this is an old topic, I would \n&gt; appreciate a pointer to the thread...\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; Background:\n&gt; \n&gt; I have written several derivatives of java.io.InputStream and \n&gt; test cases that go along with them. However, during a recent \n&gt; peer review of the code, we discovered an inconsistency \n&gt; between the contract of one of the methods in \n&gt; java.io.InputStream and my implementation of that same method \n&gt; in the specialized subclass.\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; Problem:\n&gt; \n&gt; I would like to have a set of functional tests (black-box \n&gt; style) that enforce the behaviors of the super class, \n&gt; java.io.InputStream. Then use that same set of tests to \n&gt; ensure that the basic contracts for each of the classes I \n&gt; write follow that contract (i.e. pass those generic tests). \n&gt; Does anyone have a suggestion for doing this? While this \n&gt; specific example pertains to java.io.InputStream the same \n&gt; scenario may occur with any class hierarchy.\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; Environment:\n&gt; \n&gt; I use Ant to compile and run my tests, so ideally any \n&gt; solution will be compatible with the &lt;batchtest&gt; mechanism or \n&gt; otherwise allow for the dynamic (read, &quot;automatic&quot;) addition \n&gt; of new tests.\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; Josh\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ------------------------ Yahoo!
