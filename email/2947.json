It appears that many people think there are<br/>\n&gt; &quot;magic formulas&quot; for working with JUnit. As a result, they ask silly<br/>\n&gt; questions like, &quot;How do I test an EJB with JUnit????&quot; The people who know<br/>\n&gt; the answer get so tired of writing, &quot;Search this list. Try it. What are you<br/>\n&gt; having trouble testing?&quot; that they simply stop responding. As a result,<br/>\n&gt; questions are not being answered.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I would like to ask everyone on this list to ask specific, pointed<br/>\n&gt; questions, with sample code, if at all possible. Instead of &quot;How to I test<br/>\n&gt; an EJB????&quot;, how about, &quot;I did X, Y and Z to test EJBs using JUnit, but it&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; too slow. Any tips for increasing speed? Here is a sample EJB tets case...&quot;?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; If you really don&#39;t know how to do X, try searching the web first. Try<br/>\n&gt; searching this list&#39;s archives next. If that does not get you going, then by<br/>\n&gt; all means, ask a specific, pointed question.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Please, folks! I don&#39;t want to start ignoring this list because its readers<br/>\n&gt; show no initiative.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; JBR.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; _________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; Get your FREE download of MSN Explorer at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://explorer.msn.com/intl.asp\">http://explorer.msn.com/intl.asp</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\">junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
