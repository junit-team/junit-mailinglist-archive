A feature without a <br/>\nJUnit test case doesnt&#39; exist, as far as I&#39;m concerned.<br/>\n--<br/>\nStephen Smith, MEng (Wales).<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.stephen-smith.co.uk/\">http://www.stephen-smith.co.uk/</a><br/>\n<br/>\ndavek725 wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; My company is currently doing TDD and using JUnit for our unit <br/>\n&gt; testing - both persistence testing and business logic testing.  We <br/>\n&gt; are now looking at Agitator and trying to determine if, and how, it <br/>\n&gt; fits into our current practices.  I was wondering how others have <br/>\n&gt; decided to use Agitator (or not use it).  Some of the issues we are <br/>\n&gt; struggling with:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 1.  Agitator looks like it can eliminate the need to write most JUnit <br/>\n&gt; tests (except true persistence testing).  The downside is that we <br/>\n&gt; would be left with only Agitator config files that contain our <br/>\n&gt; business logic assertions.  This seems like a big leap to take, given <br/>\n&gt; that if Agitar goes away, we have no JUnit.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 2.  Agitator mocks and factories look easy to create, but look like <br/>\n&gt; they are only useful in the context of Agitator.  I couldn&#39;t use them <br/>\n&gt; for other purposes (e.g. Fitnesse, JUnit).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 3.  Having my business logic tests in JUnit means they are in an <br/>\n&gt; understood format and things such as inputs and expected results are <br/>\n&gt; clearly visible and grouped with each test.  My impression of <br/>\n&gt; Agitator is that this wouldn&#39;t be as clear.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; Yahoo!
