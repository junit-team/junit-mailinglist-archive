I run the xp-jobs group. It got hit hard with spam (not<br/>\ntoo long after Windows XP came out... hmm...). The xp-jobs list has one or two<br/>\nposts a month, so having a few spams a day means a horrible signal-to-noise<br/>\nratio.<br/>\n<br/>\nI restricted posting to members only, but that didn&#39;t help. So now what I do<br/>\nis manually approve new members only if they reply correctly to the welcome<br/>\nmessage that gets sent when they try to sign up. There is no more spam, but it<br/>\nrequires a couple minutes a day of manual work.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nErik</div>",
