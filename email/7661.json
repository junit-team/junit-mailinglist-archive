To some extent, this depends on how  <br/>\nsmart the compiler/dependency tracker is. If you have a class which is  <br/>\nreasonably central to your project and you change a separate test file,  <br/>\nthen the test file is the only thing that gets rebuilt. If the tests  <br/>\nare in the java file, then other dependent classes may get rebuilt even  <br/>\nif you are only changing the tests (e.g. adding a new testcase). With  <br/>\nthe tests in separate files, I can refactor tests without having to  <br/>\nrebuild or even touch the code itself. When I am refactoring tests, I  <br/>\nwant to be able to recompile/rerun after every tiny change and  <br/>\nturn-around time is important.<br/>\n<br/>\nSimilarly,  version control logs are more clear. I can readily separate  <br/>\ncode changes from test changes. Pure refactoring should not change  <br/>\ntests. Test refactoring or coverage improvement should not change code.  <br/>\nAll other changes should touch both.<br/>\n<br/>\nI find that the hit is even larger for documentation generation than  <br/>\nfor compiling the code. I prefer to have the docs automatically update  <br/>\nafter every code change.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thanks in advance.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------ Yahoo!
