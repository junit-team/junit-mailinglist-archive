If so, you&#39;re a better\n&gt; coder than me :)\n\nI got bit by exactly that recently... i didn&#39;t test a setter-getter i \nhad written. And i *cut and pasted* it from another setter-getter pair \nwith the same return type.\n\nA while later, i had to resort to printf() to debug some other, \nrelatively simple code that kept failing its unit test. Of course, it \nwas reading the wrong value out of the getter. Sure, it didn&#39;t take THAT \nlong to debug, but it certainly took an order of magnitude more time \nthan the minute or two it would have required to write and run a \nsetter-getter unit test. And it broke my rhythm, as last-resort \ndebugging is prone to do.\n\nWhich reminds me of another thing i&#39;ve found i like about JUnit... when \ni do printf() debugging now, i almost always do it in the unit tests \nrather than the code itself. With more complex classes, i sometimes \ndefine toString() to dump the object&#39;s internal state, so i can just \nprint out objects from JUnit tests. This is way better than the piles of \nprintf() statements that used to litter my code.\n\n-- \n\nDavid Stagner\n\nNational Marrow Donor Program\n3001 Broadway Street NE\nBroadway Ridge Suite 500\nMinneapolis, MN  55413\n\nEmail: dstagner@...\n\n\n\n",
