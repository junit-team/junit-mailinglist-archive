Presumably the stack<br/>\n&gt; is unwound as an<br/>\n&gt; exception handler is hunted for, freeing up stack<br/>\n&gt; space.  It is the<br/>\n&gt; second stack overflow in the same suite that causes<br/>\n&gt; the problem. If the<br/>\n&gt; suite only has one error, then that suite can be run<br/>\n&gt; multiple times.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; The JVM should never crash though, in the sense of<br/>\n&gt; a core dump.  If it<br/>\n&gt; &gt; does, it&#39;s likely a JVM bug.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Thanks for the suggestion. This turned out to be<br/>\n&gt; correct. The<br/>\n&gt; JVM in question is JDK 1.3.1 for Windows.  Turning<br/>\n&gt; off compilation<br/>\n&gt; (option -Xint) eliminated the problem, as did using<br/>\n&gt; jview; JUnit<br/>\n&gt; correctly reported both errors under those<br/>\n&gt; circumstances.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; On Thu, 14 Mar 2002, Eric Heikkila wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Kind of sounds like a non-issue.  Fix the stack<br/>\n&gt; &gt; overflows. ;)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; If I didn&#39;t have bugs, I wouldn&#39;t need JUnit. :-)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; More seriously, using JUnit did reveal the bug; it<br/>\n&gt; just did so in the<br/>\n&gt; rather abrupt manner of crashing.  I&#39;d prefer to see<br/>\n&gt; a red-line and a<br/>\n&gt; message.  However, you are right, it is not an issue<br/>\n&gt; for me.  At first I<br/>\n&gt; thought that the problem might be in the custom<br/>\n&gt; implementation of the Test<br/>\n&gt; interface that I was using to bridge between JUnit<br/>\n&gt; and a test framework I<br/>\n&gt; am developing.  Had that been the case, I would have<br/>\n&gt; had an issue.  Once I<br/>\n&gt; was able to duplicate the problem with a standard<br/>\n&gt; TestCase, it was clear<br/>\n&gt; that the problem wasn&#39;t in my code, and thus not a<br/>\n&gt; problem for me.<br/>\n&gt; However the strange behaviour did suggest a bug in<br/>\n&gt; JUnit, which might be<br/>\n&gt; an issue of interest to those who develop JUnit. <br/>\n&gt; But I should have<br/>\n&gt; thought of the possibility that it was the JVM at<br/>\n&gt; fault.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Cheers,<br/>\n&gt; Theodore Norvell<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Point taken ;)<br/>\n<br/>\n-Eric<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!
