I prefer starting from what is _really_ needed, and then <br/>\n&gt; think about what is the best way to fulfill those concrete needs.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Sometimes to instant start working is good, but sometimes start thinking<br/>\nfirst is mutch better ;-) Try to make a &#39;big step&#39; can lead you make<br/>\nbecome to wallow.<br/>\n<br/>\nI prefer to start step-by-step (feature-by-feature) and if we have a<br/>\nsignificant count of features we should release it as next version. The<br/>\nremaining feature request are then the job for the version 3 of that<br/>\nspecification. I do not want the community to wait for 2 more years for<br/>\nrelease 2.0. So a combined workflow would be good.<br/>\n<br/>\nA good process can be to collect the ideas (for not more than 14 days).<br/>\nThen review and summarize it. And start a voting to collect what feature<br/>\nis most desired by the community.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter voting we should define, how the xml should look like to handle<br/>\nthat feature. This can happen while you are creating the reference<br/>\nimplementation.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen a feature is finished we should loop with the next &#39;most voted&#39;<br/>\nfeature.<br/>\n<br/>\nAre you agree?<br/>\n<br/>\nBest regards<br/>\nDaniela Waranie</div>",
