If your codebase is dozens of 1000 line files of\n&gt; &gt; function-less sp=\r\naghetti code maintained by mulitple programmers\nacross\n&gt; &gt; multiple teams i=\r\nn various geographical locations... You (and your\n&gt; &gt; organization) have a =\r\nlot of work ahead of you before you can push\nTDD.\n&gt; &gt;...\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi Gabriel.\n&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; Just to be clear, I was not restricting my argument to TDD infection.\n&gt; I=\r\n believe that the TDD1 gene, let&#39;s call it that, is considerably more\n&gt; rar=\r\ne than the T1 gene. At this point in time I&#39;d be thrilled to see\n&gt; the majo=\r\nrity of developers writing and running unit tests on a regular\n&gt; basis; whe=\r\nther they write them before, during, or after the code is\n&gt; done. At this s=\r\ntage of the game test-first is less important than\n&gt; having the tests in th=\r\ne first place - gotta walk before you run.\n&gt;\n&gt; I agree that most projects o=\r\nut there consist of 1,000s of classes with\n&gt; no tests.  I love Michael Feat=\r\nhers&#39;s definition: code without tests =3D=3D\n&gt; legacy code.  This definitio=\r\nn makes 95%+ of Java code legacy code.\n&gt; &quot;Legacy code, is not just COBOL an=\r\nymore&quot; :-).\n&gt;\n&gt; Seriously, I can, and do, sympathize that sometimes the tas=\r\nk looks\n&gt; &quot;monumental and even prohibitive&quot;. But only if you think that you=\r\n have\n&gt; to go from zero tests to 1,000s of tests right away.  I don&#39;t know =\r\nwhy\n&gt; many people think in terms of all-or-nothing when it comes to testing=\r\n.\n&gt; You have to start somewhere, and something is better than nothing.\n&gt; 10=\r\n,000 Java classes and 1 JUnit test is better than 10,000 Java\n&gt; classes and=\r\n 0 JUnit tests.  2 tests are better than 1, and so\n&gt; forth.  And look at th=\r\ne bright side, at least those 2 tests will run\n&gt; quickly.\n&gt;\n&gt; If you are st=\r\nuck in a project like the one you describe, it&#39;s probably\n&gt; counter-motivat=\r\ning to even look at metrics like\n&gt; numberOfTests/numberOfClasses, or code c=\r\noverage: &quot;Hey, we achieved 5%\n&gt; code coverage. Where&#39;s the Champagne?&quot;.  In=\r\nstead focus on the absolute\n&gt; number of tests (a simple, positive, monotoni=\r\ncally growing test\nmetric).\n&gt;\n&gt; While the &quot;monumental pile of untested spag=\r\nhetti code&quot; does not help,\n&gt; I believe a lot of people just use that as an =\r\nexcuse to not get\n&gt; started. I have seen developers rejecting regular unit =\r\ntesting even in\n&gt; greenfield projects, so there is something more fundament=\r\nal at play.\n&gt;\n&gt; Alberto\n&gt;\n&gt; http://www.junitfactory.com\n&gt; Generate JUnit te=\r\nsts. Free.\n&gt; Send us Java. Get back JUnit.\n&gt;\nAlberto,\nIt does seem that uni=\r\nt testing is still in the &#39;early adopter&#39; stage.  \nDevelopers and managers =\r\nthat I talk to and work with  understand the\nbenefits to unit testing, metr=\r\nics, coverage, CI, ... but do not adopt\nthem consistently on their projects=\r\n.\n\nI do believe that unit testing is very much a market-driven event and I\n=\r\nsay that because of all the opinions I have heard. Most of the people I\nhav=\r\ne talked to completely agree with the benefits of unit testing and\nTDD *in =\r\ntheory*, but do not implement a solution because of pressure\nfrom investors=\r\n, customers or other market factors.  After all, isn&#39;t all\nsoftware buggy?\n=\r\n\nThere are enough studies to show people the value of a good unit testing\np=\r\nrogram (TDD or not). There are also studies that show high risk may\nresult =\r\nin high reward, which unit testing can possibly hinder.\n\nI may be reaching =\r\nhere, but the question in my mind revolves around the\n&#39;event&#39; that will cha=\r\nnge people&#39;s mind.  The plublicized class action\nlawsuit against a software=\r\n company because of a major defect (security,\nlogic, whatever) will open th=\r\ne floodgates especially since membership in\nthe ABA Law Group has experienc=\r\ned exponential growth.  Lawyers have to\ndo something, right :)\n\nYou started=\r\n an interesting thread, and I look forward to the other\nresponses.\n\nJoe\n\nww=\r\nw.codign.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
