I understand you are<br/>\n&gt;  currently doing this as an exercise, so it&#39;s healthy to take it to<br/>\n&gt;  extremes and do everything by the book in order to learn, but in your<br/>\n&gt;  real work, use your judgment and decide for yourself when you are<br/>\n&gt;  indeed writing too much code, in which case it&#39;s probably safer to go<br/>\n&gt;  the usual route (get your code to work, then write tests for it).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  The downside of TDD is that you can end up writing a lot of tests for<br/>\n&gt;  business code that you quickly throw away and rewrite, so the amount<br/>\n&gt;  of churn can be quite high.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI disagree. When I&#39;ve found something difficult to write test first<br/>\nI&#39;ve always done a spike, then delete the code and rewrote it test<br/>\nfirst. I&#39;ve always found the result to be a lot more cleaner,<br/>\nespecially since I wind up cleaning up the code anyway when I used to<br/>\nwrite tests around them.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d rather have my business code tested rather than not test it under<br/>\nthe assumption it will one day be thrown away. ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\nJames </span></blockquote></div>",
