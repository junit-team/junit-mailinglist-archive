If the log is important, I have to go through it, or I mis=\r\ns\n&gt;&gt; &gt; something important. If it is not important (and I don&#39;t have to go\n=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; through it) I can skip it altogether. So what do you mean when you\n&gt;&gt; =\r\nsay I\n&gt;&gt; &gt; don&#39;t have to go through it?\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I have read carefully al=\r\nl the posts so far and I tend to agree with\n&gt;&gt; Robert. I am wonder whether =\r\nI miss something important too.\n&gt;&gt; I want to be clear, so I will take one s=\r\ntep backward. What is the MAIN\n&gt;&gt; purpose of JUnit? The answer is to be abl=\r\ne to write AUTOMATIC unit\n&gt;&gt; test. Unit test should be written is the corre=\r\nct way, that is\n&gt;&gt; correctly design. This has nothing to do with logging. M=\r\naking unit\n&gt;&gt; test AUTOMATIC contradict using logging.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &lt;you can skip =\r\nthe this paragraph&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I want to step aside for a while. Let assume that yo=\r\nu&#39;re not using\n&gt;&gt; JUnit at all and write small main function to test. I don=\r\n&#39;t want to\n&gt;&gt; counter why you shouldn&#39;t do this, let focus on what tools yo=\r\nu do use\n&gt;&gt; in this approach. In the most cases you will add System.out bot=\r\nh to\n&gt;&gt; the code and to the main. If you&#39;re using C++, for instance, you wi=\r\nll\n&gt;&gt; use preprocessor to switch on or off these output to the console. Mor=\r\ne\n&gt;&gt; advance option will be to use logging mechanism and to change it\n&gt;&gt; co=\r\nnfiguration depends on the environment your program run (that is to\n&gt;&gt; turn=\r\n on many of your log statement only in development). Everything is\n&gt;&gt; great=\r\n until your program is actually fails. Again, from the experience\n&gt;&gt; it is =\r\nalmost always the case that existing System.outs are not enough,\n&gt;&gt; that yo=\r\nu need more information or you should add some more output\n&gt;&gt; early in the =\r\ncode. So, in this point you have to option to run your\n&gt;&gt; program AGAIN wit=\r\nh debugger or to add more System.outs and to run it\n&gt;&gt; as is. In both cases=\r\n it can be the case that you should rerun your\n&gt;&gt; program again (if you use=\r\n debugger you could simply not pointed out\n&gt;&gt; when some data changed and in=\r\n the System.out case you can figure out\n&gt;&gt; that you need more System.outs).=\r\n\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; From the paragraph above one should conclude that when one write uni=\r\nt\n&gt;&gt; test there is 2 different phases. First is to write them down in the\n&gt;=\r\n&gt; hope that everything will be ok (it doesn&#39;t mean, that you design\n&gt;&gt; shou=\r\nld be poor or you shouldn&#39;t supply appropriate messages to assert\n&gt;&gt; statem=\r\nents etc) and the second phase is to rerun your test if your\n&gt;&gt; test fails.=\r\n Lets see how logging will help you.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; In the first phase I see the onl=\r\ny purpose using logs is for &#39;sanity\n&gt;&gt; check&#39; that is to ensure that you ac=\r\ntually test what your think is you\n&gt;&gt; test. If you want to make something m=\r\nore than just &#39;sanity check&#39; you\n&gt;&gt; should write unit test to your unit tes=\r\nt, that is pretty silly.\n&gt;&gt; Moreover, you need to make such &#39;sanity check&#39; =\r\nonly when you actually\n&gt;&gt; write this test. =A0For this purpose logging is a=\r\nppropriate approach, IMHO.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; In the second phase, when you rerun your u=\r\nnit test when it fails, you\n&gt;&gt; should consider to add more assert statement=\r\n and more clearly\n&gt;&gt; diagnostic messages first. When you done and you don&#39;t=\r\n see how to\n&gt;&gt; improve the design (recall I consider that design is correct=\r\n) you can\n&gt;&gt; add log statement manually. But in this case they will not be =\r\npart of\n&gt;&gt; new mechanism, because no more asserts will be added. So this ne=\r\nw\n&gt;&gt; feature will not be in use!\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Using logging in the assert statemen=\r\nt ONLY for &#39;sanity check&#39; is\n&gt;&gt; overkill, I think. As for me I make such &#39;s=\r\nanity check&#39; in the\n&gt;&gt; following way. First of all, I use log4j MANUALLY th=\r\nat is as addition\n&gt;&gt; to JUnit asserts. They don&#39;t duplicate what asserts do=\r\nes they supply\n&gt;&gt; additional information, such as what assertion was alread=\r\ny done. In\n&gt;&gt; this case when assertion will fail afterwards I can look on t=\r\nhe log to\n&gt;&gt; see in what part of unit test it happened and what tests passe=\r\nd. I go\n&gt;&gt; even further and use JDK 1.4 assert statement to document\n&gt;&gt; pre=\r\ncondition, postcondition and invariants both in the code and in the\n&gt;&gt; unit=\r\n test.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; The bottom line is that I see the sense using logs as a COMPLE=\r\nTION to\n&gt;&gt; the JUnit and only for &#39;sanity check&#39;. This use is not duplicate=\r\ns\n&gt;&gt; JUnit assert statements and could be written manually.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; --=\r\n----------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
