I&#39;d be leery of a class that generates HTML and sorts. If the\n&gt;  &gt;&gt;sort is an another class, it can be public and far easier to test.\n&gt;  &gt;&gt;\n&gt;  &gt;&gt;\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt;I&#39;ve always wondered why most developers are highly offended by making\n&gt;  &gt;things more public for purposes of testing, yet they have no problem\n&gt;  &gt;consistently and willingly violating cohesion. I suspect that it&#39;s the\n&gt;  &gt;same reason most developers worry about performance more than good\n&gt;  &gt;design: it&#39;s easier to quantify.\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt; I think that lack of protection is just easier to see. Lack of cohesion\n&gt; requires trained eyes. I have to admit that every time I teach the\n&gt; &#39;Single Responsibility Principle&#39; I feel a little odd. It&#39;s not like\n&gt; you can use a check list which tells you whether you&#39;re violating it or\n&gt; not, you just have to show people enough examples for them to &#39;get it.&#39;\n&gt; \n&gt; It reminds me of the Supreme Court of the US. There was a time when\n&gt; obscenity cases were all the rage. Producers of movies, pictures, and\n&gt; stories were prosecuted all the way up to the Supreme Court on obscenity\n&gt; grounds, and the Court was unable to articulate a definition of\n&gt; obscenity which drew a line between pornography and free speech. Some\n&gt; Saturdays the Justices would get together to view the films in evidence\n&gt; and make their decision. Justice Potter Stewart said (paraphrasing) &quot;I\n&gt; may not be able to define obscenity, but I know it when I see it.&quot;\n\nIt&#39;s similar to the Polgar method to learn to play chess well. Look at \nPolgar&#39;s book &quot;Chess&quot;: nothing but thousands of diagrams, categorized by \ntheme (&quot;mate in 1&quot;, &quot;mate in 2&quot;, &quot;double attack&quot;...) with no \nexplanation, but rather just solutions in the back. At some point, after \nlearning the basic principles and goals, you just need to be drilled \nwith examples. Playing good tactical chess is certainly related to good \ntactical design, just as reading the board and reading code are related. \nThey&#39;re languages, and we seem to acquire them effectively by seeing \nlarge numbers of examples and detecting patterns.\n-- \nJ.
