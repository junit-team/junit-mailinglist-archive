However, the test case needs to<br/>\nrecursively run against, say, the names of all the files in a folder<br/>\nand its subfolders.<br/>\n<br/>\nEach file is a different test case, but the number, type and content<br/>\nof files during each run will differ.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t want to pass all the files into my testXXX method in one shot<br/>\nbecause that would mean the following:<br/>\n- Semantically, it would be the equivalent of a single test case, not<br/>\nmultiple, and<br/>\n- The test case would abort the moment it failed on a single file<br/>\ninstead of running through all the files (like I want it to)<br/>\n<br/>\nI haven&#39;t seen this addressed anywhere. How do I achieve this? What is<br/>\nthe best/recommended way to write/execute a single JUnit test case<br/>\nwith a sequence of multiple, varying inputs?</div>",
