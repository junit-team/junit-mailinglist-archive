The reason could be a crash in<br/>\nyour VM (like an OutOfMemoryError) or something in your code calling<br/>\nSystem.exit - for example.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Someone said it is fixed bug in Ant 1.7.1.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It is not too likely that the problem is within Ant (Ant&#39;s user list<br/>\nwould have been the better forum to ask this question, BTW) but rather<br/>\nwithin your tests.  1.7.1 may have fixed a bunch of things, and so has<br/>\nAnt 1.8.0 and 1.8.1 which have been released later.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; It caused the multiple version of Ant or JUnit.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This may lead to all sorts of problems but shouldn&#39;t make your forked VM<br/>\ncrash.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Do you have any idea on that?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;d add a formatter that is pretty verbose (&quot;plain&quot; will do) and make<br/>\nsure the output goes to Ant&#39;s logging system as well as to a file.  With<br/>\nthis you should be able to at least pinpoint the test suite that crashes<br/>\nyour VM.<br/>\n<br/>\nStefan</div>",
