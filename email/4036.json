This idea comes from a path  breaking production <br/>\ntechnique called pokayoke in which you purposefully introduce a small <br/>\ndesign change so that the product can pass over the assembly line <br/>\nonly if it is 100% free of defects.<br/>\n<br/>\nPassing over assembly line is equivalent of compiling the branch for <br/>\nour code. I will try to think over and implement this idea where I <br/>\nwork.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Nils</div>",
