(If some test for the lower layers failed the test<br/>\nfor higher layers failed also). But this need faded away and<br/>\ndid not appear again, so I forgot about it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI only followed your discussion roughly, but I guess my need <br/>\nfor test hierarchies disappeared because my unit tests <br/>\nare independent from each other. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis is your example from another mail from you:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Ok, another example. I have a class that walks a classpath and generates<br/>\n&gt; listener events on things found, I test that. I have a class that listens<br/>\n </span></blockquote>to<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; such events to &quot;find&quot; things that match a certain criterion, I test that.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>If<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; the first class fails to send events, then I ought not blame (or dig into)<br/>\n&gt; the second for not finding anything. The tests are (I believe) unit tests<br/>\n </span></blockquote>of<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; each, without duplication.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>How would you blame the second for not finding anything?<br/>\nDo you run this as one or two tests?<br/>\n<br/>\nThe first test could be: are the expected events thrown for<br/>\na given classpath? Do not use the second class in this test.<br/>\n(I guess you have some listener interface: have the test-class<br/>\nimplement this listener interface: &quot;self-shunt&quot;)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe second test could be: does the second class react correctly on a given<br/>\nevent?<br/>\nIn this test the event(s) is/are created by the test code and not by the<br/>\nfirst class: Do not use the first class to create events in this test.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou do not have test code duplication here but you can run theese test<br/>\nindependently.<br/>\n<br/>\nBernd</div>",
