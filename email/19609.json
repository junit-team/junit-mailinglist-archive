Setup all three projects in <br/>\nCruise Control.  Then set Project1 and Project2 to look at the build <br/>\nstatus file for APIProject.  In the Cruise Control main config.xml <br/>\nfiles, it looks like this:<br/>\n<br/>\n     &lt;project name=&quot;Project1&quot; &gt;<br/>\n         &lt;modificationset&gt;<br/>\n             &lt;buildstatus logdir=&quot;${cc.logs.dir}/apiproject&quot; /&gt;<br/>\n             &lt;cvs /&gt;<br/>\n         &lt;/modificationset&gt;<br/>\n          ...<br/>\n     &lt;/project&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThe &lt;cvs&gt; tag checks CVS for changes in Project1, the buildstatus tag <br/>\nchecks for changes in the build status of apiproject.  This creates a <br/>\nbuild trigger based on source code changes to Project1 as well as a <br/>\ndependency on apiproject changes.<br/>\n<br/>\nNote: the cvs and project tags are somewhat abbreviated due to what <br/>\nCruise Control calls &quot;plugins&quot; which are just common setup in the <br/>\nbeginning of the config.xml file so the project description themselves <br/>\ndo not have so much redundant setup.<br/>\n<br/>\nRobert Kuropkat<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\ntripdavid wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; *This message was transferred with a trial version of CommuniGate(tm) Pro*<br/>\n&gt; What is the best approach for handing a situation where a project<br/>\n&gt; exists that represents an API to other projects? <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; For example: Project1 and Project2 are separate projects which depend<br/>\n&gt; on apiproject. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Changes are made to apiproject, such that the tests within apiproject<br/>\n&gt; pass. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; But, those changes would now break project1 and project2. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Would the solution be:<br/>\n&gt; a) when changes are made to apiproject, automatically fire off the<br/>\n&gt; tests for dependent projects (in this case Project1 and Project2)?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; b) Plan to run tests at periodic intervals of Project1 and Project2,<br/>\n&gt; so that eventually, the break will become apparent? <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; We plan to use CruiseControl to do automated builds and tests. Just<br/>\n&gt; not sure how we can know when code in an api (subproject?) will break<br/>\n&gt; the dependent projects. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Thanks!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; Yahoo!
