Simply because it depends.  Sometimes you want to \n&gt; test protected methods, sometimes you don&#39;t.\n&gt; \n&gt; My point is: placing tests classes so that it is _impossible_ to test \n&gt; protected methods is a &quot;bad&quot; decision because you restrict your \n&gt; flexibility.  By placing test classes in the same package, you still \n&gt; have that flexibility, but you don&#39;t have to use it if you don&#39;t want to.\n\nWell said. Here&#39;s my own phrasing of it... even if *in general* you only \ntest the public interface, there will be times when public bugs are \ncaused by protected/private methods. In that case, you want to write \nunit tests for the protected methods, in order to isolate the problem \nfrom the complexities and potential side effects of the public \ninterface. If you put your test classes off where they *can&#39;t* test \nprotected methods, then you have prevented yourself from using JUnit to \ntest protected methods *ever*. What&#39;s the benefit of that? Intellectual \npurity? Falling back on seat-of-the-pants debugging?\n\nPutting test classes with the main classes to enable testing protected \nmethods does not *require* that protected methods be tested. Putting \nthem in a separate package, however, makes it impossible (or at least \npossible only through a public interface redirection kludge).\n\n-- \n\nDavid Stagner\n\nNational Marrow Donor Program\n3001 Broadway Street NE\nBroadway Ridge Suite 500\nMinneapolis, MN  55413\n\nEmail: dstagner@...\n\n\n\n",
