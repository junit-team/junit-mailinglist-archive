If we use TestCase subclassing to do\n&gt;  &gt; that in JUnit, then that would mean three test case classes:\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; 1. TestXAsA extends ATests\n&gt;  &gt; 2. TestXAsB extends BTests\n&gt;  &gt; 3. TestXAsC extends CTests\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; This might bother some people, but it doesn&#39;t bother me: I don&#39;t need\n&gt;  &gt; one test case class per production code class.\n&gt; \n&gt; One test per class makes it easy to find tests that may be affected by a\n&gt; feature change. This makes it easy to run localised tests.\n\nIn my experience, it doesn&#39;t. It does, however, make it /look/ like it&#39;s \neasy to find tests that may be affected by a feature change. You really \ndon&#39;t know until you run the tests, anyway.\n\n&gt; Having tests scattered all over the place means that you tend to need to\n&gt; run all tests to make sure that a change hasn&#39;t introduced a bug. If your\n&gt; tests take a long time to run, you won&#39;t be inclined to do this.\n\nThat&#39;s just plain lazy. To anyone who says &quot;I don&#39;t want to run all \nthese tests,&quot; I have to ask, &quot;Then why did you write them?!&quot;\n\n&gt; So... the need to keep test code in one class is proportional to the length\n&gt; of time it takes your tests to run. Hmmm - another reason to try to keep\n&gt; tests running fast. :)\n\nIndeed. On the other hand, there are strong reasons to let test fixtures \norganize themselves along different lines, but that gets back to the \nquestion of the value of setUp()/tearDown(), so I won&#39;t bother going \nthere. :)\n\n&gt; (I use the TextXsomesuffix pattern as well... e.g. TestXDB for database\n&gt; dependent tests)\n\nAllow me, M. Beust !\n\n&quot;That&#39;s just another great reason for test groups....&quot;\n\n:)\n-- \nJ. B.
