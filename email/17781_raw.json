They are two different techniques, and you need \n&gt;both.\n&gt;\n&gt;Tests are written by the provider to verify that the *provider*&#39;s code \n&gt;is correct. DBC is written by the provider to verify that the *client*&#39;s \n&gt;code is correct. This is a critical distinction. The provider can rely \n&gt;on their own tests, but they cannot rely on the clients&#39;.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nI think the line is fuzzier than that.  Postconditions don&#39;t verify the \nclient. \n\nTo me, the difference is like the difference between an endoskeleton \n(checked DbC) and an exoskeleton (UTs).  Both provide support for motion \nin different ways.\n\nThe sneaky thing about DbC is that if you want to use its assertions \nessentially as tests you have to exercise your code.  It&#39;s not just a \nmatter of writing the assertions.  When you test, the code that you \nwrite is the exercising code, and you can test both clients and \nproviders.  Not saying that DbC is bad, just that I wouldn&#39;t want to \nrely on its assertion mechanism rather than tests.  On the other hand, I \nfeel oddly comfortable writing code with lots of tests and no embedded \nDbC constructs.\n\nMichael Feathers\nwww.objectmentor.com\n\n\n\n",
