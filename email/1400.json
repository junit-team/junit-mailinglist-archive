    "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1194918715\">I looked at java.awt.robot.  Robot could drive the GUI.  However, <br/>\nI&#39;ve use other robot like products (WinRunner) and found the test <br/>\ncases become very hard to maintain.  Problems arrise whenever widgets <br/>\non the screen change position.  The Robot is still trying to perform <br/>\nmouse clicks and other actions on the old location.  Since GUI are <br/>\ngooey (i.e. change shape a lot while being developed), the testing <br/>\nscript shouldn&#39;t depend on screen locations.<br/>\n<br/>\nInstead, I think the best approach is using some tools that access <br/>\nthe GUI components directly, no matter where they are placed on the <br/>\nscreen.  This can test the functionality of the GUI.  A human will <br/>\nstill have to perform &quot;Usability&quot; testing.<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope to automate the more mundane and time consuming tasks of <br/>\ntesting valid and invalid input, and checking the general function of <br/>\nthe system.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Greg<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In junit@y..., Joseph Vaughan &lt;jvaughan@o...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; Greg - Have you (or anyone else) looked at using java.awt.robot for <br/>\nGUI<br/>\n&gt; automation?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I don&#39;t know if its any good or not, but I&#39;ll be at least <br/>\nevaluating it for<br/>\n&gt; my next project in a month or so.  I&#39;d be curious what others think <br/>\nof it.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; One big hurdle in this kind of testing is timing.  You often have <br/>\nto make<br/>\n&gt; sure that event A has finished before you invoke event B.  This can <br/>\nbe<br/>\n&gt; tricky when you are dealing with networked systems and suchwhat.  <br/>\nRobot&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; waitForIdle() might help with that ... but like I said I haven&#39;t <br/>\nreally had<br/>\n&gt; a chance to peer too deep. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Its described here:<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://developer.java.sun.com/developer/TechTips/2000/tt0711.html\">http://developer.java.sun.com/developer/TechTips/2000/tt0711.html</a> <br/>\n(second<br/>\n&gt; article down).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;  - joe<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Vladimir Bossicard [mailto:vladimir@b...]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Monday, June 04, 2001 12:30 PM<br/>\n&gt; To: junit@y...<br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: [junit] Functional Testing with JUnit<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Hi Matt,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; could you please send me your code?
