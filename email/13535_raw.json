I would be very interested to hear of\nanything better, but I do find it =\r\ndifficult to imagine anything that\nwould be capable of replacing the value =\r\nof even a poor set of\nhand-written tests.\n\n If you just like the idea of to=\r\nols as rewarding toys, then I like\nJester (http://jester.sourceforge.net/),=\r\n although it isn&#39;t exactly\nsimple to integrate into a development environme=\r\nnt.\n\n I think Kevin Klinemeier caught the more approachable issue, which is=\r\n\nhow to encourage a team to develop their own tests. In addition to his\nadv=\r\nice I can only suggest that you:\n\n 1. Ask them to create tests as part of n=\r\normal development tasks.\n 2. Give them time to create the tests (although y=\r\nou will eventually\nfind the tests save time, they will need more time up-fr=\r\nont).\n 3. Support them in creating the tests and don&#39;t place great pressure=\r\n on\nthem over it, especially if the underlying development is pressurised\na=\r\nlready.\n 4. Evaluate tests together, perhaps have a group task where each p=\r\nerson\ncreates a test for a class or method and then you compare and discuss=\r\n\n(this is where jester can be quite valuable in exposing test\nblind-spots).=\r\n\n 5. Link bug-fixing to test creation -- assuming that you have a\nbug-datab=\r\nase, this is an effective way of adding tests of value to\nexisting code.\n 6=\r\n. If you feel they won&#39;t react badly to it, consider writing seed\ntests you=\r\nrself.\n\n\n Although we&#39;re meant to be rational, technical people, this is on=\r\ne of\nthe many issues that is more problematic on an emotional level than it=\r\n\nis in any practical sense. Only you know your team and how they work and\ni=\r\nt could be that none of the above would be useful for you. I can&#39;t\nclaim to=\r\n have cracked the problem myself, but there&#39;s always hope. \n\n Best of luck =\r\nwith it,\n \n\n Damian Sinclair\n\n=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=\r\n=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=\r\n=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=\r\n=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D\nThis email may contain confidential and privileged infor=\r\nmation and is intended for the named or\nauthorised recipients only.
