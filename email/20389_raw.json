There are also one-time setUp and tearDown methods\nthat was i=\r\nn TestSetup object in JUnit 3.8. See code examples above.\n\n \n \n&gt; - For 120 =\r\ndifferent test case, if it has same format and  is in text\n&gt; file, I recomm=\r\nend writing another class to process reading it and\n&gt; return turn each pair=\r\n. \n&gt; \n&gt; Let test case use this class to load those test cases, this will sa=\r\nve\n&gt; amount of time instead of doing them all by hand.\nYou can do it using =\r\n@Parametrized method. You can write separate class\nand use in @Parametrized=\r\n method or you can write an actual code their.  \n\n&gt; - Another issue, I thin=\r\nk  it&#39;s better to divide those 120  cases into\n&gt; different catagories (ie. =\r\nsimple selection, selection with where\n&gt; clause etc...) . Write a test case=\r\n for each catagory.  So that when\n&gt; your code break you can analyse which k=\r\nind of sql query is the reason.\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m quite new to JUnit too, so if some=\r\n expert see any mistakes or any\n&gt; recommends.  \n&gt; \n&gt; Hope it helps\n&gt;\nThis i=\r\ns very deep point. When you write your tests with parametrized\nmethod, that=\r\n is when your test your class with different inputs, you\nshould divide your=\r\n input in to EQUIVALENCE CLASSES. \nLet me explain this in more simple examp=\r\nle. Suppose, you want to check\nMath.sqrt(double a) methods. What values sho=\r\nuld you check? First of\nall, you have to notice, that valid input is only [=\r\n0, +Inf). So, all\nvalues are spitted down at least to (-Inf, 0), [0, +Inf).=\r\n This are\nyour equivalence class in first approximation. You should try, sa=\r\ny -7\nfrom (-Inf, ), +20 from [0, +Inf). You should also try value that is\ni=\r\nn boundary of your interval, that is 0. Sometimes, it is reasonable\nto test=\r\n also value that are &quot;near&quot; boundary, for example 1 and -1. It\ncan be the c=\r\nase, that this separation is not enough. First of all,\nwhat about special d=\r\nouble values such as NaN? What about -Inf and\n+Inf? And if you test them, p=\r\nerhaps it is worth to test\nDouble.MAX_VALUE and Double.MIN_VALUE as &quot;neares=\r\nt&quot; values? It can be\nalso reasonable to test the quadratic integer numbers =\r\nseparately.\n(Quadratic number is number that is exact square, that is a is\n=\r\nQuadratic number iff exist number x such that x*x=3Da) (Run\nSystem.out.prin=\r\ntln(Math.pow(Math.sqrt(15), 2)); to see why this can be\nimportant). So, you=\r\nr equivalence class will be (-Inf, 0), {0},\n(0,1,2,4,9, 16,... all quadrati=\r\nc numbers}=3DQI, (0, +Inf)&#92;quadratic\nnumbers QI, {NaN}, {-Inf}, {+Inf}.\nIn =\r\nyour case is up to your to decide how to divide to equivalence\nclasses. Par=\r\ntition to simple selection, selection with where clause\netc can be or can b=\r\ne not useful just as in the example with\nMath.sqrt() and quadratic numbers.=\r\n\n\n\n\n",
