If that&#39;s not the case for some reason,\nthen I think you&#39;d also want to think about why that&#39;s the case before\njust going with examining serialization files.\n\n&gt; &gt; Even in\n&gt; &gt; that case, though, testing that stuff saved with saveLicense can be\n&gt; &gt; loaded with loadLicense isn&#39;t a bad thing to do.\n&gt; \n&gt; Yes.  Agreed.  But try to avoid using a file to do it.\n\nDefinitely.  Another poster (was it you, Dave?) suggested that String\nstreams are the way to go, and I agree with that.  If you need to share\nthese things between tests, make them fixtures and share them that way.\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nThe New Yahoo! Search - Faster. Easier.
