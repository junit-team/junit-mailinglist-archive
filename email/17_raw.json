I think that one could do it by e=\r\nxamining\n&gt;&gt; the classpath (available via System.getProperty()) for .class f=\r\niles and\n&gt;&gt; using reflection to determine whether they were TestCases, but =\r\nI haven&#39;t yet\n&gt;&gt; tried it.  Anybody have anything that does this?\n&gt; \n&gt; I wi=\r\nll support that in some of the next JUnitX versions although there\n&gt; is a\n&gt;=\r\n drawback. If somebody manually removes a test from a suite() method\n&gt; beca=\r\nuse\n&gt; it is broken and no longer maintained for some reason, it would be\n&gt; =\r\ncollected\n&gt; by an automated search.\n&gt; Using a special marker interface migh=\r\nt be a rough solution, but there is\n&gt; more\n&gt; to it than just working around=\r\n Java=B4s restrictions in traversing the\n&gt; tree\n&gt; of avail classes.\n\nI supp=\r\nose that&#39;s true.  On the other hand, traversal might be a nice first\ncut.\n\n=\r\nEach package could have a &quot;restrictions.txt&quot; file or something similar that=\r\n\nlisted cases not to run.  Another idea might be to enhance the TestRunner =\r\nto\nallow you to disable certain found tests, especially if not running a gi=\r\nven\ntest were a temporary thing.  In my development, this would probably be=\r\n OK,\nsince I might remove or otherwise disable more permanently a test that=\r\n I\nwasn&#39;t maintaining at the moment.\n\nIf the test finder looked for a suite=\r\n() method in each TestCase class before\nusing its methods via reflection, o=\r\nne could disable an entire TestCase by\nsimply returning an empty TestSuite =\r\nfrom that method.  (I&#39;m not sure if the\n&quot;new TestSuite(SomeTest.class)&quot; alr=\r\neady looks for suite methods or not.)\n\nAnother issue might be use of native=\r\n code in some tests: our team has\n&quot;AllTests&quot; and &quot;ReallyAllTests&quot; to exclud=\r\ne some classes that we haven&#39;t been\nable to make work well under the loadin=\r\ng runner.  (For the curious: we get a\nsecurity exception of some kind.  We =\r\nmight be able to work around this,\nespecially with Java 2, but haven&#39;t yet =\r\nwith 1.1.)\n\nI might play around with some of this using JUnit 3.2 if possib=\r\nle, but I&#39;m\nnot sure that I&#39;ll find time.\n\nBy the way, what are some of the=\r\n forces that led you to start JUnitX?  I\nhaven&#39;t had a chance to really pla=\r\ny with it, but might -- it looks like it\ncould have some nice stuff.  (I&#39;m =\r\nnot sure whether I&#39;d use the major\nfunctionality of access to restricted cl=\r\nasses and members or not, though.)\nDoes it work with JDK 1.1?\n\n---\nBen Schr=\r\noeder\nschroeder@...\n\n\n",
