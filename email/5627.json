    "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1433692380\"><blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">&gt; I was thinking more along the lines of a weekly build type of<br/>\n&gt; process, where everyone puts their updated code into a central <br/>\n&gt; location and the buildmaster compiles and tests everything. <br/>\n&gt; I can easily envision a case where someone either forgets to <br/>\n&gt; test their code or checks in the wrong code.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I can understand the frustration of builing the application once a week and<br/>\nseeing that it&#39;s not working.  But isn&#39;t it possible to build the application<br/>\nonce a day, or make a partial build (e.g. for one platform)?  If your system is<br/>\ncomplex, try to isolate the application to test.  For example, if your working<br/>\nwith CORBA, don&#39;t test the corba bridge (your tests acting like a CORBA client)<br/>\nbut test your CORBA interface (your tests acting like a CORBA bridge).  You&#39;ll<br/>\nbe able to test your CORBA code without starting a server.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf someone forgets to test their code or checks in the wrong code... well<br/>\nmistakes happen.  But having 1 (a) or 100 (b) errors while running your tests<br/>\ntells you exactly the same thing: you have bugs in your code.  Not to forget<br/>\nthat (a) is the same error as the first error of (b).<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; everyone was testing their code multiple times a day and builds were a <br/>\n&gt; daily occurrence, but some of us are in traditional with the &quot;fragile&quot; <br/>\n&gt; way of doing things and are doing the best we can ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>so fix it! :-)  Set up a dedicated build server and install a tool to check out<br/>\nyour code every day from CVS, compile it, execute the tests and report the<br/>\nerrors (like continuous integration on SF).<br/>\n<br/>\ngood luck<br/>\n<br/>\n-Vladimir<br/>\n\r<br/>\n--<br/>\nVladimir Bossicard<br/>\nwww.bossicard.com</div>",
