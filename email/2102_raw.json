You don&#39;t \ngive the types of the arrays nor their expected lengths (do they hold \na few simple elements, dozens of complicated ones, millions, ...).  \nPerhaps you&#39;d be better off constructing a vector of differences and \nasserting the vector as empty.  Adding the differences to a string \nand asserting it as equal to &quot;&quot;.  Or counting the differences and \nassertEquals(0, count).\n\nJust as assertEquals(0, count) logs more information than assertTrue\n(count == 0), you can write your own assert method to log what&#39;s \nimportant in your test.\n\n&gt; Another example:\n&gt; \n&gt;   // For two arrays: expected, actual\n&gt;   assertEquals(expected.length, actual.length);\n&gt;   for (int i = Math.min(expected.length-1, actual.length-1); i &gt;= 0;\n&gt; i--) \n&gt;   {\n&gt;     assertEquals(expected[i], actual[i]);\n&gt;   }\n&gt; \n&gt; This would log a complete list of incorrect elements in addition to \nthe\n&gt; size being wrong. So, this example just goes to show that multiple\n&gt; reporting might be helpful in some circumstances. Obviously not all,\n&gt; and quite possibly not useful enough for the sizeable and \nchallenging\n&gt; framework change required to support it.\n&gt; \n&gt; Regards,\n&gt; \n&gt; Rob\n\n\n\n",
