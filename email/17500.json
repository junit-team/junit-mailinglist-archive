Doing so I often discover bugs that aren&#39;t at<br/>\n&gt; all what I expected and that would have been missed by mock testing. The<br/>\n&gt; thorniest bugs are often at the intersections between classes rather<br/>\n&gt; than in the classes themselves.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I gather your test suites run quickly enough to get enough feedback to <br/>\nkeep you happy. Mine don&#39;t, so I want faster feedback, and more stuff <br/>\nrunning in memory makes that happen.<br/>\n<br/>\nA question: when you test business logic that touches a relational <br/>\ndatabase, do you just put up with how slow those tests are? If not, what <br/>\ndo you do? HSQLDB? Something else?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Like interfaces, mocks have their place; but also like interfaces, that<br/>\n&gt; place is often seen to be broader than it really is.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This is certainly the case for those learning to use these techniques. <br/>\nIf you don&#39;t first underdo it, then overdo it, how do you do know how <br/>\nmuch is enough?<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJ.
