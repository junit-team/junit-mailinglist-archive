What I am finding is that \nthere are a many compile cases to be tested but not so many as that they \nwould need to be generated automatically.  So, unless Java could execute \nthe good code and only throw an exception when it hits bad code, it \nseems that the code snippets need to be encapsulated somehow and \ncompiled and executed at runtime.\n\nI haven&#39;t looked at java 1.6 or at sun&#39;s Main.  I&#39;ll add these to my \nlist, but it seems that whatever the solution, the context of the test \ncase would have to be included, with each test case including a copy of \nall the supporting code.  This would require some manner of automation \nto take a line of code, embed it in an automatically generated program \nwith all of its contextual code, and then try and compile each test case.\n\nHmmmmm.  Another approach would be to isolate the test case method \ncontaining the questionable code snippets, enclosing each code snippet \nto be tested for compile errors in some JUnit call, perhaps with the \nline to be tested passed as a String.  Then one at a time, JUnit would \nexclude all but one of these code snippets while trying to compile the \nwhole test method.  In this manner, the compile assertion test would \n(hopefully) appear and work much like ordinary dynamic testing using JUnit.\n\nBeing a consumer of JUnit, not a developer, please forgive me if my \n&quot;solution&quot; fails to make any sense.\n\n--jon\n\n&gt; Message: 5 Date: Wed May 31, 2006 12:51 pm (PDT) From: &quot;Mark Salter&quot; marksalter@... Subject: Re: testing for compile Jon Barrilleaux wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; How do you test to make sure that what you think should happen actually \n&gt;&gt;&gt; happens at compile time?  Don&#39;t forget that JUnit is about regression \n&gt;&gt;&gt; testing.  If you make some change in the type hierarchies or \n&gt;&gt;&gt; implementations, how do you make sure you haven&#39;t broken the \n&gt;&gt;&gt; compile-time enforcement of what should and should not be allowed...\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Without actually compiling all of the code, I&#39;m not sure you can precisely.\n&gt; Perhaps the trick is to compile just the code you can predict the \n&gt; expected outcome for and check it conforms.\n&gt; \n&gt; Could\n&gt;      sun.tools.javac.Main (JDK 1.5)\n&gt; or\n&gt;      javax.tools.JavaCompilerTool (JDK 1.6+)\n&gt; \n&gt; help in your aim?  These appear to be two ways of invoking javac directly.\n&gt; \n&gt; If you could invoke the compiler in this way - perhaps once for each \n&gt; test source element, you could use JUnit to assertTrue/False on the return.\n&gt; \n&gt; The run method of JavaCompilerTool returns a boolean :-\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;\n&gt; true if and only all the files compiled without errors; false otherwise\n&gt; &quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; DelegatorA.getNodeOut().connectTo(DelegatorB.getNodeIn()); // no error\n&gt; \n&gt; [snip]\n&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; SubDelegA.getNodeIn().connectTo(SubDelegB.getNodeOut()); // no error\n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; etc, etc, etc....\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Will you be attempting to generate the possible combinations, if so, can \n&gt; you predict within the generation what should and shouldn&#39;t compile?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; So, is there any way for JUnit to include an assertion for a compile \n&gt;&gt;&gt; time error?  Earlier attempts on my part, and suggestions by others, \n&gt;&gt;&gt; have been unsuccessful.  Is this something that is currently impossible \n&gt;&gt;&gt; in Java?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; I admit, I have not looked through your other threads, so if this \n&gt; suggestion has been made and rejected already, please forgive my laziness!\n&gt; \n&gt; -- Mark\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
