Basically, we have a bunch of JUnit tests that check SQL<br/>\n&gt; &quot;SELECT&quot; statements that are generated by a framework.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; These tests are currently a little painful to maintain, because if you<br/>\n&gt; modify the framework so that the order of the tables, columns, or where<br/>\n&gt; clause statements changes somehow, every test has to change.  That got<br/>\n&gt; me wondering about how to do an <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   assertSemanticEquals(expectedSQL, actualSQL)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; where the order of things within each brance of the select is<br/>\n&gt; irrelevant.  For example,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   select foo.col1, bar.col2<br/>\n&gt;       from bar, foo <br/>\n&gt;       where bar.id = foo.id and bar.id &gt; 4<br/>\n&gt;       order by bar.col2<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; is semantically equivalent to<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   select bar.col2, foo.col1<br/>\n&gt;       from foo, bar <br/>\n&gt;       where bar.id &gt; 4 and foo.id = bar.id<br/>\n&gt;       order by bar.col2<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>My colleague and I are working on a research project that is<br/>\ntangentially related to this question, so I thought that I would<br/>\nprovide a few pointers and see if the JUnit community has some<br/>\ncomments or insights.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe are focusing on the testing and analysis of database-driven<br/>\napplications by testing the program, the database, and the program&#39;s<br/>\ninteraction with the database.  Our initial work has focused on the<br/>\ncreation of algorithms that can produce a representation of a program<br/>\nand its interaction with a database and then enumerate the<br/>\ndatabase-interaction associations for a new family of data flow-based<br/>\ntest adequacy criteria.<br/>\n<br/>\nOur initial goal is to determine how well tests ensure that the<br/>\nprogram does not violate the completeness and validity of the database<br/>\nthat it defines and uses with embedded SQL statements.  In the future,<br/>\nwe will be developing testing tools that aid test data generation,<br/>\ntest execution, and regression testing.  Since I frequently use tools<br/>\nlike JUnit, DBUnit, etc. for my own development, my personal goal is<br/>\nto construct a complete tool suite, based upon these existing tools,<br/>\nto handle many of these issues.<br/>\n<br/>\nMore information about the Database drIven Application Testing tOol<br/>\nModuleS!

We also value your insights about some of the practical testing<br/>\nissues that you would encounter during the application of such test<br/>\nadequacy criteria and/or other issues related to testing database-driven<br/>\napplications.<br/>\n<br/>\nKind Regards,<br/>\n<br/>\ngreg<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nGregory M.
