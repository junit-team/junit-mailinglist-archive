I approved it.  Being <br/>\na moderator is always a little tricky.  If I err, it&#39;s on the side of <br/>\nnot censoring enough.  In this case, I had been traveling and behind on <br/>\nreading the list, so I didn&#39;t have a history of recent postings.  I also <br/>\nfigured that any responses would be similar to a response from J.B., and <br/>\nI wanted the original poster (and this list) to experience that.  As <br/>\nsuch, I chose not to censor it and rather let it run its course.  In <br/>\nhindsight, here&#39;s the response I should have made earlier...<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d highly recommend that everyone listen to what J.B. has to say here. <br/>\n His advice comes from practical experience and far exceeds the amount <br/>\nyou pay for it.  If you don&#39;t want replies from him, then I suggest you <br/>\neither don&#39;t post questions here or learn to ignore his replies.  In any <br/>\nevent, be prepared for a response because he&#39;s here to help like <br/>\neveryone else.  If you don&#39;t agree with something he says, then I&#39;d <br/>\nencourage you to challenge him in a professional manner.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI, for one, consider this community very fortunate to have J.B. as a <br/>\nvolunteer.  Indeed, I place a high value on his insights and <br/>\ncontributions.  My actions as a moderator in this case should in no way <br/>\nbe taken as a reflection of my opinions of J.B.  My sincere apologies <br/>\nfor any confusion this may have caused.       <br/>\n<br/>\nIn the meantime, I&#39;m putting myself on notice...<br/>\n<br/>\nMike<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nMike Clark<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://clarkware.com\">http://clarkware.com</a><br/>\n(720) 851-2014<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",
