This way you could enrich the test-run by declaratively<br/>\nhooking into the execution. Having global rules you could for instance,<br/>\ngiven a match-criteria selects points in the run to hook into.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow about &quot;declaratively enhance&quot; as a meaning?<br/>\n<br/>\nWhatever implementation you choose I have the following wishes based on<br/>\nworking with bumblebee and trying to do these kind of global enhancements:<br/>\n<br/>\n* That I do not /have to/ run the tests via a specific suite to have my<br/>\nglobal rules applied. The reason is that it&#39;s sometimes desirable to run<br/>\nonly one test and it would be nice if that test is enhanced in the same way<br/>\nit would be if run via the suite.<br/>\n<br/>\n* That I would not have to add anymore information than can be found on the<br/>\nclass path. The reason is that needing specific configuration such as system<br/>\nproperties or environment variables would make my tests harder to run.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have often wanted to make this kind of global rules and I think that<br/>\nhaving the possibility would open up for a host of new ways to creatively<br/>\nenhance JUnit. Tools such as bumblebee being one   of many things that would<br/>\nbe simple to do given such a feature. I hooked into a suite to capture<br/>\nSystem.out for bumblebee documentation and it works well given that I run<br/>\nvia that suite. If I don&#39;t run via that suite I have experienced hard to<br/>\ndebug problems.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----------------------------------------------------<br/>\nJoakim Ohlrogge<br/>\nAgical AB<br/>\nVästerlånggatan 79, 2 tr<br/>\n111 29 Stockholm, SWEDEN<br/>\n<br/>\nMobile: +46-708-754004<br/>\nBlog: johlrogge.wordpress.com<br/>\nE-mail: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:joakim.ohlrogge@...\">joakim.ohlrogge@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Sat, Dec 5, 2009 at 7:43 PM, Kent Beck &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kentb@...\">kentb@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; All,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I understand global rules operationally not denotationally.

To have the rule working in several tests,<br/>\n&gt; you have to place the Rule in each test.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; However, I am searching for a way to activate a Rule for all the tests<br/>\n&gt; that are executed, without needing to add the rule to each test. Perhaps by<br/>\n&gt; specifying a Java property parameter when running the tests (I could also<br/>\n&gt; set this as a global Java option, therefore being used upon each execution<br/>\n&gt; of the JVM).<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Do you know if this is possible?<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; The reason why I need this, is: I am making the plans and gathering the<br/>\n&gt; ideas for creating a simple Swing application that will display the results<br/>\n&gt; of the executed tests (just like the JUnit view in Eclipse/Idea/Netbeans,<br/>\n&gt; but perhaps with more details, and also available for anyone, not just IDE<br/>\n&gt; users). Currently I developed a small agent rule, that you can place in your<br/>\n&gt; test, and it will report to the console the status of your tests (the Swing<br/>\n&gt; console runs remotely).<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; This is ok, but it means that you will have to add this rule to each<br/>\n&gt; and every test that you have. It also means that will not be an easy task to<br/>\n&gt; disable this rule, if you don&#39;t want it anymore.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Therefore a possibility to enable Rules globally for all tests I think<br/>\n&gt; is the best solution for my case, and also a good tool to have for various<br/>\n&gt; other tasks.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; What do you think? Also, what do you think about the Swing console<br/>\n&gt; idea?<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Cheers,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Bogdan<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Yahoo!
