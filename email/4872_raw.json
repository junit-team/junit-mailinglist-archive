He \n&gt; states &quot;that a test suite that covers one implementation of a \n&gt; specification does not necessarily cover a different \n&gt; implementation of the same specification&quot;.\n&gt; \n&gt; I interpret &quot;not necessarily&quot; as &quot;there&#39;s no such thing in \n&gt; the general case&quot;. One short example which is hopefully \n&gt; obvious enough this time. Consider a function for sorting an \n&gt; array of String objects:\n\n[Snipping a bunch of stuff]\n\nIn reality, you *can* have the best of both worlds.  The\nissue at hand is that a general test case excercises all the\ncontracts that the public interface has.  A contract is a\nguarantee that the class must satisfy.\n\nI start my tests at the general case.  If someone reports\na bug to me where a particular implementation goofs up\ninternally, I add a testcase that reproduces the problem.\nI am careful to make sure that the testcase does not\nintroduce additional &quot;undocumented&quot; contracts to how the\nclass is used.  In practice, it&#39;s not that hard.  A bug is\nwhen the class fails to live up to its contracts anyway.\n\nWhen I am done, I have the benefit of the general testcase\nplus the new regression test that is added due to the bug.\nThe regression test has the added benefit of ensuring the\nparticular circumstance that caused the bug in the first\nimplementation doesn&#39;t creep back in.\n\nIf what you are talking about is different than what I just\ndescribed, perhaps it is because we&#39;re not speaking the same\nlanguage?\n\n\n",
