We \nare having some issues whereby the static variables in the mock \nobjects are being held in the class loader.  This appears to be \ncreating nasty confusion and giving us errors in our tests depending \non the granularity by which they are run. Our utlimate aim was to \nexecute our application test classes through a master TestAll \nhowever this seems like its not going to work.  Our proposed work \naround is to use ant to identify each test case and run them \nindependently.  \n\nHas anyone seen this issue before and are there any suggested work \narounds ?\n\nThanks\nMatthew.\n\n\n\n",
