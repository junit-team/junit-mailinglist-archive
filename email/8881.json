Bertrand said &quot;hypothesis is false, so all conclusions are provable&quot;.<br/>\nThat doesn&#39;t make them all false, nor mine meaningless, just not certain.<br/>\nMine might&#39;ve been right however I started, perhaps plain luck. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;snip/&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n          Like hell. I&#39;ve proposed a solution to you a number of times.<br/>\n     Why don&#39;t       you  listen to it?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI listened, I totally absorbed what you said, I just didn&#39;t buy it. Heck,<br/>\nwho knows ... maybe you weren&#39;t right.<br/>\n<br/>\nI write code, I test my code, I debug my code when tests fail by trying to<br/>\nanalyse the output. I was hoping for it to be easier to analyse, w/o a lot<br/>\nof manual effort, but I don&#39;t have an itch big enough to attempt to write<br/>\nsuch a tool -- especially when it&#39;d be cheap/clean to do it in the<br/>\nframework. Also, much as I could craft some sort of add on (perhaps leverage<br/>\nmy own sub-class from TestCase) I think it needs too much of what is in the<br/>\nframework in order to work well, and I don&#39;t fancy re-writing the thing.<br/>\n<br/>\nI use eclipse, I use ant -- I like the integration into those tools more<br/>\nthan I like my idea. If I can&#39;t get you to contemplate the concept, then I<br/>\nprobably have little chance of persuading them. If they don&#39;t use it, I<br/>\nwon&#39;t benefit. Another reason not to start.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis was my first topic on this mailing list, and much as you were pretty<br/>\nmeasured/polite (at least at the start) I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll be back for more.<br/>\nOpen Source is (IMHO) about open minded discussion of ideas, and I don&#39;t<br/>\nthink I found that here. No worries, have fun w/ what you do.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for your time.<br/>\n<br/>\nregards,<br/>\n<br/>\nAdam<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",
