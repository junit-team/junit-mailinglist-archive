As you become more and more familiar with <br/>\nwriting tests your estimates will get better.  It&#39;s just a matter of <br/>\npractice.  I doubt anyone can come up with a generic scheme.  An estimate of <br/>\nwriting tests is dependent on many variables:<br/>\n  1. whether its being written TestFirst<br/>\n  2. if it&#39;s pre-existing code, how easy is it to test<br/>\n  3. how familiar you are with testing strategies<br/>\n  4. how much test coverage you are looking for<br/>\n  5. etc., etc., etc.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJason Rogers<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I,<br/>\nbut Christ liveth in me: and the life which I now live in <br/>\nthe flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved <br/>\nme, and gave himself for me.&quot;<br/>\n    Galatians 2:20</div>",
