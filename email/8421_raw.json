Units are generally the atomic elements of an application (single classes, for instance), while components may be composed of one or more units. \n\n\nIntegration testing \n   Integration tests assess the integration and communication between the components and systems that compose an application.\n    \n\nso as you can see Unit testing is a preface to Integration testing. \nWhen we test, we execute the functions of an application with the intent of exposing defects. A good test is one that is likely to uncover a flaw that was previously unknown.\n \n\n&quot;Carlson, Dave&quot; &lt;dave.carlson@...&gt; wrote:\nMike,\n\nThis is a great question.  I come at the subject from almost the opposite\ndirection.  I have done a lot of unit testing, but very little integration\ntesting (integration testing was done by a different group). My thoughts\nhave been that writing unit tests rather than integration tests allow me to\ndevelop faster because I do not need to rely on the entire system being up\nand running before I can test my code.  Also, I never have to wait for\nanother team to post their fix before moving on.  My tests are local, and\ntell me if _my_ code is working as intended.\n\nI agree that unit testing does not remove the need for integration\ntesting(they test different things). I would argue that having a full suite\nof unit tests makes it much more likely the integration tests will pass the\nfirst time as long as the system design was correct.  Also, bugs found\nduring unit testing are usually much quicker to find and squash.\n\n\n--Dave\n\n&gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; From: Mike Bresnahan [mailto:java-junit@...]\n&gt; Sent: Friday, June 20, 2003 9:54 AM\n&gt; To: junit@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Subject: [junit] Unit Testing vs Integration Testing\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; I have experience with integration testing but not much with \n&gt; unit testing.\n&gt; I&#39;ve been reading up on unit testing  (e.g. mock objects, test first\n&gt; development).  However, I have not found an article that explains the\n&gt; advantages of unit testing vs integration testing.  My \n&gt; perhaps naive hunch\n&gt; is that the cost-per-bug-eliminated of unit testing is higher \n&gt; than that of\n&gt; integration testing.  It appears this way because a single \n&gt; integration test\n&gt; tests a lot more code than a single unit test and takes about the same\n&gt; amount of time to construct.  Plus it seems to me that a \n&gt; whole suite of unit\n&gt; tests with 100% code coverage cannot guarantee that even the \n&gt; simplest system\n&gt; wide behavior is correct (e.g. the web page appears).  Am I \n&gt; wrong about\n&gt; this?  Can someone refer me information about this topic.  A \n&gt; scientific\n&gt; study paper with real numbers would be welcome.\n&gt; \n&gt; Mike Bresnahan\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ------------------------ Yahoo!
