As part of the testing, I want to keep a log of the responses from the code for debugging purposes.  It would be really helpful to have some simple process to print out the tests name and other properties into the log.  Since there are hundreds of tests, I would like to make this a common step (ie call a method) to do this.  Problem is finding the name of the test itself (without having to pass it into the logging method or hacking the stack).<br/>\n<br/>\nI see there is a Description class in the runner.  Is there any way to access the runner (i.e. a singleton or static getter) from the test case?</div>",
