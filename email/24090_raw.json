That site has been\noperated and maintained by 8thlight.com for several years, and by Object\nMentor before that.  But it recently had a rather nasty failure, and it&#39;s\nnot clear when the content that had been hosted only there will come back.\n\nRather than spend a lot of effort recreating the old situation, I&#39;d like to\nmove us to a new situation, in which the team that develops JUnit is the\nsame one that develops the primary information sources about JUnit.  Along\nthose lines, I&#39;d like to get the github pages for JUnit ready to be a good\nnew home for junit.org.  These pages are hosted at\nhttp://kentbeck.github.com/junit.  They&#39;re currently pretty sad, but they\ncan be edited by opening pull requests against\nhttps://github.com/KentBeck/junit/tree/gh-pages.  Ideally, it would be a\nvisually clean single page, with a short description of what JUnit is, and\nlinks to downloads, javadoc, mailing list, and the wiki (\nhttp://github.com/kentbeck/junit/wiki), which is itself incomplete, but\ngetting better day by day as a source of user documentation.\n\nIf anyone feels like rolling up their sleeves and give this a try, it would\nbe a great step forward.  I&#39;m out of the office all next week, but am happy\nto move quickly getting the pieces in place upon my return.\n\nThanks, all,\n\n   David Saff\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n",
