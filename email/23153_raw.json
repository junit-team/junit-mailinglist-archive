Because the EPL h=\r\nas superseded the CPL as its new version, it is not necessary to seek the a=\r\npproval of past contributors. You can simply re-license the code under the =\r\nEPL as other projects such as Mondrian and olap4j[1] have done.\n\nObviously,=\r\n the license is your decision. I just want to clarify that the burden of mo=\r\nving to the EPL is relatively low.\n\nSee the second last paragraph of Sectio=\r\nn 7 of the CPL and EPL.\n\nMike Milinkovich\nExecutive Director,\nEclipse Found=\r\nation\n\n[1] http://forums.pentaho.com/showthread.php?69944-License-upgrade-f=\r\nrom-CPL-to-EPL \n\n--- In junit@yahoogroups.com, Kent Beck &lt;kentb@...&gt; wrote:=\r\n\n&gt; Thank you for the message. It is not practical to change the \n&gt; license =\r\nfor JUnit because of the difficult of identifying and \n&gt; notifying contribu=\r\ntors. Commercial licenses are available and have\n&gt; been sold through Three =\r\nRivers Consulting, Inc. with terms crafted\n&gt; to meet your needs. Please hav=\r\ne your lawyers contact me for details.\n&gt; \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; \n&gt; Kent Beck\n&gt; =\r\nThree Rivers Consulting, Inc.\n\n\n",
