The test\n&gt; needs to express=\r\n how the object calls out through the interface, not\n&gt; how the object and o=\r\nne specific implementation  work.\n\nSeems sound, because that&#39;s the definiti=\r\non of the interface, anyway,\nif that&#39;s what is used there. An interface mus=\r\ntn&#39;t have anything to do\nwith implementation, at all.\n\nSo how and where do =\r\nthe tests express how the object calls out through\nthe interface?\nMaybe in =\r\nthe mock implementation by doing some assertions on the\narguments of the in=\r\nterface-method? So are you allowed to put part of\nyour assertions other tha=\r\nn the test method-body in JUnit?\n\nThanks for sharing your experiences, Nat!=\r\n\nCsaba\n\n\n",
