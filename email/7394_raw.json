Using assert statements would be a compromise.\n&gt;\n&gt; I think I could use assert statements at the beginning of a method\n&gt; and at the end, checking preconditions and postconditions.\n&gt;\n\nAs already stated, such asserts do not test code - they only check for\nproblems in pre and postconditions. There is a lot more to testing than just\nthat.\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Besides all this problems whis JUnit is another one: Successful\n&gt; JUnits tests are no guarantee that there are no bugs in the code I\n&gt; read. This has to do with data chains. But I didn&#39;t understand this.\n&gt;\n&gt; And I read that it is extremely time consuming to create test cases\n&gt; for all possible cases.\n\nA few axioms that any tester worth their salt knows by heart:\n\n1) There is no way to guarantee there are no bugs in any code no matter what\nyou do.\n\n2) You can never test all code for all possible cases - a fairly simple\nexample is often quoted of a small snippet of code that adds two integers\ntogether taking several millenia just to test the obvious cases - and that\nis with the computer doing the testing.\n\nWhat you can do is test the cases that are most likely to find a bug - the\nnumber of cases and amount of time necessary to find bugs and properly test\nthe code drops by several orders of magnitude.\n\n&gt; The synchronisation between test cases and methods to be tested would\n&gt; is time consuming. And what happens if you change a method so that\n&gt; preconditions or postconditions will become different? Will you\n&gt; remember to change the JUnit to fit these changes? Or will you\n&gt; sometimes forget? Error detecting is then twice as hard, since it can\n&gt; originate in the test class or in the class to be tested. Thats a\n&gt; point where assert statements are better in my eyes compared to JUnit.\n\nYour production code and test code should not be so tightly coupled that\nthese are real problems - especially the problem of where you need to find\nthe error.\n\nThe alternatives? Finding bugs in your code later (asserts don&#39;t really test\nyour code and don&#39;t show bugs near as often as unit tests). It is always\ncheaper to find bugs/errors early on. You can test early, find your bugs\nearly and fix them early when the cost is low, or you can test later and fix\nyour bugs when it is much more costly. This doesn&#39;t even address the\nbenefits you get from TDD which are numerous and somewhat separate.\n\nFWIW,\nLauren\n\n=====\nhttp://developerdude.mystarband.net\n\n\n\n",
