You can try to argue that &quot;it ought\nto be, or rewrite your code!&quot; but, as before, I think you&#39;re straying\ntoo close to the &quot;Java code is self-documenting&quot; argument, which I\nfind ... dubious at best.\n\nIt makes your test reports clearer when failures occur  I prefer to\nsee &quot;Wrong number of Login attempts recorded ...&quot; rather than\n&quot;testValidLogin.assertEquals failed ... &quot;  As a result I often don&#39;t\neven have to look at the test code to fix the problem.  Without\nmessages, I have to at the very least go and look to see what the\nassertion&#39;s variables are named before I can begin fixing the problem.\n\nIt&#39;s also easier to write a short sentence about what&#39;s being asserted\nthan it is to be sure that you&#39;ve chosen values and variable names\nsuch that future readers can divine their purpose.  That&#39;s a valuable\ntask as well, but for the time involved, there&#39;s no reason you can&#39;t\nwrite a little text as well.  Or to put it pithily:\n\nI feel that I&#39;m proficient with Java, but when I want to explain\nsomething, especially *why* something, I generally prefer English.\n\n-Kevin\n\nOn Tue, 01 Mar 2005 22:24:06 -0600, J.
