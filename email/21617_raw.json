The\n&gt; tradeoff was that if we dropped getName(), programmers would be f=\r\nree to\n&gt; subclass from anything for their test classes. I haven&#39;t subsequen=\r\ntly used\n&gt; this freedom to any good effect, but it seemed like a good idea =\r\nat the time.\n&gt;  \n&gt; With 4.7 (available from GitHub or the 4.7 snapshot on S=\r\nourceForge), you can\n&gt; use interceptors to capture the test&#39;s name. It&#39;s ea=\r\nsy, if you already know\n&gt; about interceptors that is and you don&#39;t waste 15=\r\n minutes remembering that\n&gt; interceptors have to be public and that you sti=\r\nll have to run with the\n&gt; Interceptors runner. They say that memory is the =\r\nsecond thing to go...\n&gt;  \n&gt; @RunWith(Interceptors.class)\n&gt; public class Nam=\r\neTest {\n&gt;   String name;\n&gt;   @Interceptor \n&gt;   public StatementInterceptor =\r\nnamer=3D new StatementInterceptor(){\n&gt;     @Override\n&gt;     public Statement=\r\n intercept(Statement base, FrameworkMethod method) {\n&gt;       name=3D method=\r\n.getName();\n&gt;       return base;\n&gt;     }\n&gt;   };\n&gt;   @Test\n&gt;   public void f=\r\nunnyName() {\n&gt;     assertEquals(&quot;funnyName&quot;, name);\n&gt;   } \n&gt; }\n&gt; \n&gt; This su=\r\nffers from cleverness, but it doesn&#39;t get the problem solved without\n&gt; an e=\r\nntire new runner, which was the point of interceptors in the first\n&gt; place.=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; Regards,\n&gt; \n&gt; Kent\n&gt; ________________________________\n&gt; \n&gt; From: juni=\r\nt@yahoogroups.com [mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com] On Behalf Of chaz\n&gt; Sent: =\r\nFriday, May 08, 2009 8:51 AM\n&gt; To: junit@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Subject: [junit]=\r\n What happened to getName()?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Hi, \n&gt; I was wondering, is th=\r\nere a particularly good reason why the most useful\n&gt; method getName() was r=\r\nemoved in junit 4.x? Is there another method or way\n&gt; for me to get the cur=\r\nrent name of the method executing for reporting\n&gt; purposes?\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; chaz\n&gt;\n\n\n\n",
