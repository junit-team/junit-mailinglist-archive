But we never used that term.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe most effective and common form of automation is one in which the<br/>\nmachine (or computer) and the human each perform the tasks that they<br/>\ndo best or more effectively.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnless it&#39;s misused, automation is a good thing - a VERY good thing.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe first benefit of automation is that it frees human beings from<br/>\nperforming aspects of a given task that don&#39;t require their<br/>\nintelligence, creativity, and insight and allows them to focus on the<br/>\naspects that do.<br/>\n<br/>\nA second benefit of automation is that it allows you to do things that<br/>\n would be impossible or impractical to do manually and allows human<br/>\nbeings to reach well beyond what they could do on their own.  Some<br/>\npeople call this IA (Intelligence Amplification).<br/>\n<br/>\nWe designed Agitator to automate the aspects of testing that would<br/>\nbenefit from automation and, VERY intentionally, did NOT automate the<br/>\nparts that REQUIRE human intelligence, creativity, and understanding<br/>\nto have any meaning (e.g. the creation of test assertions).<br/>\n<br/>\nDifferent people prefer different levels of automation for different<br/>\ntasks (e.g. my mother still likes to make home-made fettuccine without<br/>\na pasta maker - mixing them and cutting them by hand.  Enjoying the<br/>\nprocess and liking the fact that each strand is a little different.<br/>\nTakes ~2hrs though. Other use a Cuisinart and a pasta machine.  Others<br/>\nbuy them at Safeway :-)).<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen it comes to testing, including test creation, my belief and<br/>\nexperience is that the *right* *level* of automation is not only<br/>\nacceptable and desirable, but necessary.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlberto</div>",
