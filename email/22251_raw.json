In this case, Test A is &quot;less \n&gt; than&quot; Test=\r\n B. You might want to run Test B first as a result.\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;ve seen two reas=\r\nons for test ordering:\n&gt;   * Optimization--getting the whole suite to run m=\r\nore quickly \n&gt; by not running tests that are guaranteed to fail\n&gt;   * Preci=\r\nse feedback--getting the most specific test failure \n&gt; possible and not be =\r\noverwhelmed by the failure of a whole \n&gt; bunch of dependent tests\n&gt; \n&gt; I as=\r\nsume that only a few tests will fail on any given run \n&gt; (I&#39;ve measured tha=\r\nt failure counts follow a power law \n&gt; distribution). Because of this I pre=\r\nfer the JUnit Max-style \n&gt; optimization through test ordering and ignore th=\r\ne precision problem.\n\nThis makes a certain amount of sense to me. I&#39;ve rare=\r\nly been in\nthe position of being overwhelmed by a lot of test failures myse=\r\nlf.\nWhen it happens (as it just did this AM) it&#39;s usually when I run\nthe te=\r\nsts on all platforms after doing a bit of development on\na single platform.=\r\n Even then, the confusion is only momentary.\n\nAnd yet, I get reports of oth=\r\ner folks having this interpretation\nproblem all the time. It may be that th=\r\ne problem lies in how they\nare doing their development.\n\nIn any case, the m=\r\nention of JUnit Max leads me to think that \n*policies* for ordering are per=\r\nhaps better done outside the test\nrunning framework itself. Hmmm...\n\nCharli=\r\ne\n\n&gt; Regards,\n&gt; \n&gt; Kent\n&gt; \n&gt; On Dec 30, 2009, at 12:11 PM, Charlie Poole wr=\r\note:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Hi Kent,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; It seems to me that a coverage tool like Cl=\r\nover could \n&gt; discover this \n&gt; &gt; &gt; information dynamically with[out] the us=\r\ner having to specify more \n&gt; &gt; &gt; meta-information about tests that could be=\r\n wrong and would need \n&gt; &gt; &gt; maintenance. Isn&#39;t removing tedium why we have=\r\n computers in the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; first place?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; As far as I know, coverage t=\r\nools deal well with direct dependencies \n&gt; &gt; but not with logical (interpre=\r\ntive) dependency.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; For example, if we have\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Test A --&gt; SUT =\r\nA --&gt; SUT B\n&gt; &gt; Test B --&gt; SUT B\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Even in this simple case, coverag=\r\ne analysis won&#39;t tell us anything \n&gt; &gt; about the relationship between A and=\r\n B, although we could make some \n&gt; &gt; deductions by examining the results.\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; \n&gt; &gt; If there were some way to tell the framework &quot;Test A depends on \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; functionality, which is tested directly by B&quot; then I can imagine \n&gt; &gt; sev=\r\neral good outcomes:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 1) The test result output could be made much c=\r\nlearer - by \n&gt; emphasizing \n&gt; &gt; the B result when both tests had failed. So=\r\nme approaches I \n&gt; can think \n&gt; &gt; include subordinating the A result to tha=\r\nt of B, \n&gt; highlighting B, not \n&gt; &gt; showing A at all and marking A as incon=\r\nclusive.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 2) Users would be discouraged from seeking annotations th=\r\nat provide \n&gt; &gt; for direct ordering of tests or the actual &quot;hard&quot;\n&gt; &gt; depen=\r\ndencies.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 3) Less important, but as an optimization, the framework =\r\ncould \n&gt; &gt; suppress running of A if B had already failed.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Charlie\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Kent\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; On Dec 29, 2009, at 2:28 PM, Pigneri, Rocco wr=\r\note:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Charlie,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;As a framework author, I can=\r\n see that allowing the user to \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;specify ordering is a simpler impl=\r\nementation. But I think it&#39;s \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;more interesting to imagine the user=\r\n specifying the \n&gt; nature of the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;dependencies and allowing the fr=\r\namework to figure out \n&gt; a strategy.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I am very much with y=\r\nou on this one. In my experience,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; there have been a lot of times when=\r\n functions under test \n&gt; within the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; same class depend upon each othe=\r\nr, and it would have been \n&gt; great to \n&gt; &gt; &gt; have the test harness know tha=\r\nt information. When I was \n&gt; refactoring \n&gt; &gt; &gt; code for a new framework pa=\r\nckage, I would have loved to \n&gt; have the UI \n&gt; &gt; &gt; to display non-dependent=\r\n tests first as it would have \n&gt; shown me very \n&gt; &gt; &gt; clearly the source of=\r\n the problem.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Specifying only the relationships in code an=\r\nd leaving the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; display strategy to the test harness would allow more f=\r\nlexible \n&gt; &gt; &gt; display and execution of these tests based upon the user&#39;s g=\r\noals \n&gt; &gt; &gt; rather than upon the dependencies themselves. I could \n&gt; imagin=\r\ne myself \n&gt; &gt; &gt; asking the UI only to display the least dependent \n&gt; functi=\r\nons&#39; errors \n&gt; &gt; &gt; and to hide all other errors for quick debugging on swee=\r\nping \n&gt; &gt; &gt; optimizations. I could also want to see the dependent tests in =\r\na \n&gt; &gt; &gt; tree in case I am changing a single class and want to \n&gt; understan=\r\nd the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; effects of what I am touching. I could also want to see \n&gt; all=\r\n tests in \n&gt; &gt; &gt; a single list with the least dependent at the top and the =\r\nmost \n&gt; &gt; &gt; dependent on the bottom when running regression tests. As you c=\r\nan \n&gt; &gt; &gt; see, the chosen view depends more upon what I am doing \n&gt; than up=\r\non the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; test dependencies themselves.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Finally, being=\r\n able to list dependencies between test\n&gt; &gt; &gt; classes in addition to test c=\r\nases would also JUnit to \n&gt; report which \n&gt; &gt; &gt; components of the system de=\r\npend upon each other. This simple \n&gt; &gt; &gt; extension would greatly increase t=\r\nhe power of the \n&gt; dependency models \n&gt; &gt; &gt; for larger systems (particularl=\r\ny regression tests).\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thank you,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Rocco\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; From: junit@yahoogroups.com [mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com]\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; On Behalf\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Of Charlie Poole\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sent: Thursday, December 24,=\r\n 2009 12:09 AM\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; To: junit@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Subject: RE: [juni=\r\nt] Order of execution for tests\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hi C=E9dric,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; On another list, I identified the same variations of \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; d=\r\nependency but with the variation that for case 1. We might \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; run=\r\n B\n&gt; &gt; &gt; anyway but\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; could highlight the error in A in some way.=\r\n That\n&gt; &gt; &gt; approach doesn&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; require ordering the tests in any =\r\nparticular way, which\n&gt; &gt; &gt; has some advantages.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It still promo=\r\ntes developer efficiency while not worrying \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; about execution ef=\r\nficiency.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yes, we call these &quot;soft dependen=\r\ncies&quot;.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If &quot;b&quot; has a hard dependency on &quot;a&quot; and &quot;a&quot; fail=\r\ns, \n&gt; &quot;a&quot; will be \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; marked &quot;FAILED&quot; and b &quot;SKIPPED&quot;.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; If &quot;b&quot; has a soft dependency on &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot; will still run\n&gt; &gt; &gt; even i=\r\nf &quot;a&quot; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; fails but a warning could be displayed in the log.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This is an implementation-based view of the tests: i.e. \n&gt; they w=\r\nill \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; either be run or not run.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The distinction I w=\r\nas trying to make - and I think David as\n&gt; &gt; &gt; well - is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; based on t=\r\nhe cause and nature of the dependency.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; For the sake of argument, I&#39;=\r\nll try to redefine what \n&gt; you&#39;re calling \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hard and Soft along thos=\r\ne lines.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hard: Test A does something (sets state) upon whi=\r\nch B depends.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; For example, A may write to a data store and B might =\r\ntry to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; read the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; information back. Or A might create a complex=\r\n object and B\n&gt; &gt; &gt; might try\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to call a method on that object. If w=\r\ne allow this sort of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; thing, then\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; there is no choice but to ru=\r\nn A first and it makes sense to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; not run B\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; at all if A fails. =\r\nHowever, I would not want a unit test\n&gt; &gt; &gt; framework to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; allow it.\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Soft: Test A tests some functionality upon which some othe=\r\nr \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; functionality, tested by B, depends. Therefore, if test A\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nfails, Test\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; B will either fail as well or be inconclusive, so nothi=\r\nng\n&gt; &gt; &gt; further can\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; be learned from test B. In this case, a testin=\r\ng framework could \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; respond in a number of ways to the dependency:\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; 1) Run the tests in order, skipping B if A fails.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 2) Run the=\r\n tests in an arbitrary order, but skip B if A already \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ran and fail=\r\ned.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 3) Run the tests in an arbitrary order, not skipping any of\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; them but\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; organize reporting in such a way that a failure of A ta=\r\nkes\n&gt; &gt; &gt; precedence\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; over a failure of B.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As a fra=\r\nmework author, I can see that allowing the user \n&gt; to specify \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; orde=\r\nring is a simpler implementation. But I think it&#39;s more \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; interestin=\r\ng to imagine the user specifying the nature of the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; dependencies an=\r\nd allowing the framework to figure out a \n&gt; strategy.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Char=\r\nlie\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Every time we have discussed this potential feature =\r\nfor\n&gt; &gt; &gt; TestNG, the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; discussion ended up being non conclusive on=\r\n the real interest \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and the existing ability to mark certain meth=\r\nods as\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;alwaysRun&quot; already\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; fills a big part of this scenari=\r\no, so I always ended up\n&gt; &gt; &gt; punting on\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it, but I&#39;d be happy to =\r\nhear if someone can come up with\n&gt; &gt; &gt; a good use\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; case for soft d=\r\nependencies...\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ***C=E9dric\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; *\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been rem=\r\noved]\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; -----------------------------=\r\n-------\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yahoo!
