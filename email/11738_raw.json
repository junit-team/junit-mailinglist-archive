Agitar makes tools that automate\n&gt;  &gt; and support developer testing. The editors of testdriven.com wish\n&gt;  &gt; Kent great success in his new role.\n&gt; \n&gt;  &gt; &quot;There is a strong movement towards increased accountability for\n&gt;  &gt; software developers and software development organizations.\n&gt;  &gt; Accountability is expected from every other profession in the world,\n&gt;  &gt; and now software developers are being held accountable too.\n&gt;  &gt; Developer Testing is a important step towards accountability. It\n&gt;  &gt; gives developers a way to demonstrate the quality of the software\n&gt;  &gt; they produce. Developing transparently, they become more productive\n&gt;  &gt; by wasting less time reworking errors&quot;, says Kent.\n&gt; \n&gt; Perhaps, now that the &quot;developer testing&quot; usage has been blessed (with\n&gt; proper casing, no less !-) the community can acknowledge that\n&gt; developers can automate testing &quot;beyond the unit&quot; (e.g. functional\n&gt; testing). (Perhaps, even that GUI developers _should_ use them :-)\n&gt; Just because they named it xUnit doesn&#39;t mean you can only unit test\n&gt; with it!\n&gt; \n&gt;  &gt; http://www.testdriven.com/modules/news/article.php?storyid=161\n&gt;  &gt; http://www.testdriven.com/modules/news/article.php?storyid=163\n\nThis bothers me, only because we&#39;ve been pushing the term &quot;Programmer \nTesting&quot;, and now, rather than collide with &quot;unit testing&quot;, it has to \ncollide with &quot;Developer Testing&quot;. The good news is that we have survived \nto this point, so perhaps it doesn&#39;t matter.\n\nAll that said, I&#39;d rather the community move forward than stand still, \nand this looks good in that regard.\n-- \nJ.
