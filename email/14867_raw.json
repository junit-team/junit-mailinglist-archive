But maybe your experience differs?\n\nI must admit I don&#39;t have much experience testing applications in a ME\nsetting yet. I am, however, doing some testing of a java application which\nis supposed to run on both J2SE 1.3 and above and J2ME CDC/Foundation. So\nfar, I have not tested this on J2ME platforms (or equivalent emulators). \n\nI agree totally that most most bugs are probably programming errors that\nare relevant to all J2ME devices. I also agree that testing on an emulator\nwould be convenient and beneficial. But when a suitable emulator is not\navailable, testing on a small device, or using a J2ME vm on a desktop\nmachine as I mentioned earlier, is probably better than no testing at all.\nThat is why I asked if there are any knwon issues using JUnit and/or\nTestNG on a J2ME CDC device.\n\n-- \nJohn\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\n__________________________________ \nYahoo!
