There&#39;s three kinds of software\n&gt;  out there:\n&gt;\n&gt;  1) Software good enough that some company finally decides to shrink-wrap\n&gt;  it and ship it to millions, or put it up on their public website and\n&gt;  wait to get bought by Yahoo!\n&gt;  2) Software just good enough for the single customer that paid for it to\n&gt;  pay off the contract.\n&gt;  3) Software that never sees the light of day. (try googling for &quot;* of\n&gt;  software projects fail&quot;)\n\nI didn&#39;t even think about #3. Sadly that also happens... TDD can be a\npart of the answer here but  I bet a whole lot more is wrong in those\nprojectcs.\n\n&gt;  she was told: 1) They&#39;re rolling out a new computer system next year, 2)\n&gt;  Of course, it will probably take about six months to shake out all the\n&gt;  bugs, but after that, it will be really nice.\n&gt;\n&gt;  I was floored that: 1) My wife and her informant both took it for\n&gt;  granted that the software would release with significant bugs, 2) My own\n&gt;  first reaction was actually &quot;Yeah, what can you do.&quot; (indignation came\n&gt;  later), 3) We&#39;re talking about _prescribing drugs to hospital patients_\n&gt;  here.\n\nThat reminds me of when I started out as a programmer and I was very\nintimidated by the fact that I knew so little and everyone else must\nknow so much. After a while I got some experience but it was not\n&quot;real&quot; experience, we didn&#39;t have really good control over what we\nwere doing so I dreamt of working on a &quot;real&quot; team, you know the kind\nthey must have in banks and when developing medical equipment and\nsuch... Later I have been working at  a bank and I know more than I\nwould like to know about development of medical equipment.\n\n&gt;\n&gt;  However, perhaps none of this is the point.  In the end, it doesn&#39;t\n&gt;  matter if the global software industry is producing software that meets\n&gt;  some criteria of &quot;good enough&quot;.  What matters to most of our paychecks\n&gt;  is that our software is better than what our customers could get more\n&gt;  cheaply from someone else.  I submit that disciplined unit testing has\n&gt;  enough success stories that it&#39;s worth trying it to see if it makes\n&gt;  things better.\n\nCouldn&#39;t agree with you more. When I think that things around me works\ngood enough and I can&#39;t see any problems that needs to be solved I\nwill be really scared since it probably means that:\n\na) I have given up\nb) I have stopped learning and trying new things.\nc) there is probably a c...\n\n",
