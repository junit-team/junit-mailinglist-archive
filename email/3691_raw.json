They throw away everything in the message they don&#39;t\nunderstand, do a convoluted response table lookup, and send a canned email\nback. Yahoo may be using something like that. There are several companies\nthat sell such software. It seems to emulate the behavior of an underpaid\nand underqualified tech reasonably well.\n\nOn Wed, 2 Jan 2002, Erik Hanson wrote:\n\n&gt; &quot;Philippe Vanpeperstraete&quot; &lt;philippe.vanpeperstraete@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; This is the reaction I received from Yahoo about the spamming sent to our\n&gt; &gt; list recently. Any reactions? Time to look for a better platform?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; [Yahoo&#39;s useless response deleted]\n&gt;\n&gt; In my experience, Yahoo employees don&#39;t actually read the email you send them.\n&gt; They just come up with some random guess as to what you are mailing about.\n&gt; With one or two exceptions, every reponse I&#39;ve gotten from them shows that\n&gt; they had no idea what I was writing about.\n&gt;\n&gt; Anyway, on to spam. I run the xp-jobs group. It got hit hard with spam (not\n&gt; too long after Windows XP came out... hmm...). The xp-jobs list has one or two\n&gt; posts a month, so having a few spams a day means a horrible signal-to-noise\n&gt; ratio.\n&gt;\n&gt; I restricted posting to members only, but that didn&#39;t help. So now what I do\n&gt; is manually approve new members only if they reply correctly to the welcome\n&gt; message that gets sent when they try to sign up. There is no more spam, but it\n&gt; requires a couple minutes a day of manual work.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Erik\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
