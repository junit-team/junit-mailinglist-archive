Would that work? Isn&#39;t that how JUnitPerf works?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Yes.  However, my note was saying that the framework-extension approach <br/>\n&gt; may not<br/>\n&gt; (easily) work in some cases.  For example, if your fixture-setup in your<br/>\n&gt; TestCases took much longer, relatively, than the actual execution time <br/>\n&gt; of the<br/>\n&gt; Class Under Test.  This could cause (relatively) slight variances in the<br/>\n&gt; fixture-setup times to obscure (relatively) large variances in the <br/>\n&gt; excution time<br/>\n&gt; of your Class Under Test.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Then I would override runBare() to generate more events: one after <br/>\nsetUp() and one before tearDown(), then augment TestListener, then have <br/>\nthe test monitor implement the bigger TestListener interface. All you <br/>\nneed are two more events, and since you can fix that in one place....<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s entirely possible that JUnit-addons Test Runner already does this.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnderstand, I&#39;m not trying to squash your enthusiasm for AOP. You just <br/>\nhave that Golden Hammer look in your eye.... :)<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJ. B.
