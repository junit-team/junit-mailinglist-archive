That is if test &quot;basic1&quot; doesn&#39;t pass, don&#39;t even expect \ntest &quot;lessbasic1&quot; and test &quot;lessbasic2&quot; to pass. For example, in the \nMoneyTest example in the &quot;Junit cookbook&quot;, testMoneyEquals is very basic and \nif that one fails, many tests will also fail. What my idea is about is *not* \nrelated to ordering the execution of the tests themselves. (I personnally \nbelieve they should de order-independant, the runners could even run them in \na random order to ensure developpers make them independant.) The idea is \nabout ordering the *test results*.\n\nI personnally hate when suddenly 20 tests fails and I have to inspect all of \nthat ouput to know where is possibly the problem. I would like an \nerror/failure in testMoneyEquals() to show *first* in the output. How to \nimplement this? The test writer could somehow specify a &quot;level&quot; for each \ntest (basic, mid, complex). That could be totally optionnal and thus not \nchange the current API. That would be *just a hint* from the test writer to \nthe person running the tests saying &quot;hey, look there first&quot;.\n\nPersonnally I&#39;m not even sure it&#39;s worth it, but I wanted to share that idea \nwith people on the list.\n\nMathieu\n\n&gt;From: Mike Clark Reply-To: junit@yahoogroups.com To: junit@yahoogroups.com \n&gt;Subject: Re: AW: [junit] Ordered execution of test cases Date: Mon, 2 Apr \n&gt;2001 07:16:49 -0700 (PDT)\n[...]\n&gt;Agreed. They are executed in this order only because the underlying \n&gt;collection is ordered - an implementation detail not to be depended upon. I \n&gt;also agree that tests should be independent; however, the original poster \n&gt;was aware of these recommendations and willing to accept the implications.\n&gt;\n&gt;Mike\n&gt;\n&gt;===== Mike Clark Clarkware Consulting, Inc.
