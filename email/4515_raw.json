If you want to keep your test classes \ncompletely separate from the classes tested, then you&#39;ll only be testing \nthe public interface (and you need to feel certain all your private \nmethods work when they can only be tested indirectly via the public \ninterface). If you want to test private methods directly, you must run \nyour tests as inner classes.\n\nWhy do you think tests &quot;obscure&quot; the code base, though? If you use an \ninner class, just put it at the very bottom of the source file, and \nprogrammers should be able to just ignore it. If you use a consistent \nnaming scheme, programmers can also ignore test methods in whatever IDE \nyou&#39;re using. Alternately, you could put the tests in separate classes \nin the same package, so you can test package-local methods.\n\nPersonally, i don&#39;t like the idea of putting unit tests in a separate \npackage, for two reasons - first, the tests would only have access to \npublic methods, not package or private methods. This makes test-first \ncoding harder, as the private methods can only be observed indirectly. \nAnd second, it makes it too easy to ignore the test suite, &quot;just this \none time&quot;, which leads to untested code. But this is very much my own \nopinion on how things should be done.\n-- \n\nDavid Stagner\n\nNational Marrow Donor Program\n3001 Broadway Street NE\nBroadway Ridge Suite 500\nMinneapolis, MN  55413\n\nEmail: dstagner@...\n\n\n\n",
