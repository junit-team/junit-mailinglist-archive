First, the naming convention tells<br/>\nyou that a method is a constructor. Understanding Java should tell you<br/>\neverything you need to know about why that method is there. A<br/>\nconstructor&#39;s job is to ensure that an object is usable and &quot;ready to<br/>\nrock&quot; when it&#39;s handed off. Part of an object being &quot;ready to rock&quot;,<br/>\nis that it should be fully loaded and in a guaranteed valid state.<br/>\nTelling people to do the least amount possible in a constructor is<br/>\nencouraging them to hand out objects that are (potentially) in an<br/>\ninvalid internal state. That will get you a &quot;reading of the riot act&quot;<br/>\non any project that I&#39;m leading. An object must _always_ have a valid<br/>\ninternal state. As programs run in more and more multithreaded<br/>\nenvironments these days, this rule becomes even more important. You<br/>\n_never_ know when your object might be accessed, therefore it should<br/>\n_always_ be ready for access.<br/>\n<br/>\nI agree with point two, but sometimes naming conventions carry as much<br/>\nmeaning as a long method name. For example, a Struts Action object has<br/>\nan &quot;execute&quot; method; that&#39;s a short name and while it may seem that it<br/>\ncould benefit from expansion, in the context of a Struts application,<br/>\nit has a very well defined and understood meaning. (Kind of like<br/>\nconstructors. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nPoint five. I agree up to a point. There will always be some things<br/>\nthat need to be done in specific sequences. Opening and closing files<br/>\nleaps to mind at this point.<br/>\n<br/>\nSimon<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nwww.simonpeter.org</div>",
