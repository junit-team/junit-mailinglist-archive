I have  a suite that lines up about 25 test \nclasses ( each containing say 10 test methods ) and I iterate for 300 \nobjects to add these tests to a suite. I would like to know any best \npractices to ensure I don&#39;t get any OutOfMemoryErrors. I changed the \njvm tag to increase virtual memory to say 512 but, if I keep adding \nmany tests to this suite, what would be the next item to ensure I&#39;m \ndoing. I am also setting TestCase member variables to null where \npossible. What would be the next step? The reason I ask is because I \nwould like to push JUnit to the limit and have it test all day and \nnight for a large application. Any help or comments would be \nappreciated. Even different design techniques are welcome.\n\nCheers!\nClaudio\n\n\n",
