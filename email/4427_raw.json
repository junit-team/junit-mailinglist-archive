In my suite() \n&gt;&gt; method\n&gt;&gt; I list the specific tests I want to run, rather than just returning a \n&gt;&gt; new\n&gt;&gt; TestSuite with the testcase class specified.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; If your tests are dependant from each other, you may reconsider refactor\n&gt; them so that they can be execution in any order.\n&gt;\n&gt; As for JUnit, unless you modify the runners, I don&#39;t think you can\n&gt; parametrize JUnit to do what you want.  If you use Ant, you have the\n&gt; &quot;haltonfailure&quot; option of the JUnit task but you have to check if it&#39;s\n&gt; really what you want.\n&gt;\n&gt; general note: if you don&#39;t specify a suite() method, JUnit will\n&gt; automatically extract all your test methods from your class.  So you\n&gt; don&#39;t need to write\n&gt;\n&gt;     public static Test suite() {\n&gt;        return new TestSuite(myClass.class);\n&gt;\n&gt;    }\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Also, I am having trouble with the Swing UI tester.  It created a\n&gt;&gt; junit.properties file to set the &quot;loading&quot; property to false, but it \n&gt;&gt; does\n&gt;&gt; not find my property file.  I specified the USER.HOME env variable as \n&gt;&gt; well\n&gt;&gt; as putting the file in my classpath.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; The best way to figure out where JUnit looks for junit.properties file\n&gt; is to search the file on your hard drive.  JUnit searches for the\n&gt; &quot;user.home&quot; variable and not &quot;USER.HOME&quot;, maybe it&#39;s the problem.\n&gt;\n&gt; -Vladimir\n&gt; --\n&gt; Vladimir Bossicard\n&gt; www.bossicard.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
