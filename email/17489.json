Google&#39;s a hotbed of the sort of programmers who like to read<br/>\n&gt; and write books about OO theory and language design. But most of the<br/>\n&gt; world is not Google.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI have to say I&#39;m quite amused to be characterized this way, but I&#39;ll gloss<br/>\nover the personal stuff to get back to the debate.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs I mentioned earlier, Spring, Eclipse and a few other popular frameworks<br/>\nin the Java world have shown that interfaces are not just a fad and that<br/>\ntheir usefulness to solve real-world problems is solidly established, and<br/>\nincreasing every day.<br/>\n<br/>\nConversely, the exaggerated reliance on concrete classes has proven (again:<br/>\nboth in books and in the industry) to cause all sorts of code smells, among<br/>\nwhich:  unnecessary coupling, difficulty to test, problematic maintenance,<br/>\nreliance on undocumented behavior, etc...<br/>\n<br/>\nOn a more general level, it&#39;s quite interesting to see TDD advocates now<br/>\nfinding themselves in the difficult position of having to choose beween<br/>\n&quot;doing the simplest thing that could possibly work&quot; (avoid interfaces, use<br/>\nhard core concrete classes) and &quot;write code that can be tested&quot; (and<br/>\ninterfaces are usually recognized to help in that area).<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ll give a chance to other readers on this mailing-list to jump in and<br/>\nstate their thoughts on interfaces before digging deeper myself.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nCédric<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://testng.org\">http://testng.org</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed] </span></blockquote></div>",
