    "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-635198000\">A simple solution to the test ordering problem would be to define your<br/>\nown &quot;OrderedTestSuite&quot; class that maintains the order in which things<br/>\nwere added to the suite.  The main problem with this is hooking it into<br/>\nJUnit&#39;s test runner -- that involves some minor hacking.  Alternately,<br/>\nyou could define your own junit.framework.TestSuite with the desired<br/>\nsemantics and place it before JUnit in your classpath; the test runners<br/>\nshould then use your version of the class instead.<br/>\n<br/>\n--Sameer<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; I&#39;ve been relying upon the undocumented behavior in JUnit&#39;s reflection<br/>\n&gt; support.  Reflection seems to return methods based on their order within<br/>\n&gt; the class file, and JUnit&#39;s Result stores failures in a vector.<br/>\n&gt; Vector&#39;s elements() method is documented as returning the contents in<br/>\n&gt; vector order.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; So, basically, I write my tests in order, simplest first, most complex<br/>\n&gt; last, and it comes out in the right order if I use have JUnit use<br/>\n&gt; reflection to identify the test methods.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Naturally, if Kent or Erich change the Result class, I&#39;m hosed.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; If you wanted to do this &quot;right&quot;, you could extend TestRunner and<br/>\n&gt; replace printFailures() with a version which sorts the enumeration based<br/>\n&gt; on whatever criteria you like.  Method name comes to mind as something<br/>\n&gt; easy to use.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Personnally I&#39;m not even sure it&#39;s worth it, but I wanted to share<br/>\n&gt; &gt; that idea with people on the list.<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; Oh, I think it&#39;s worth it.  The last time I brought it up I got<br/>\n&gt; flamed. :p I hope you fare better than I did. </span></blockquote></div>",
