I try to spend \nless time worrying about whether I fit global definitions of &quot;bad&quot; or \n&quot;worthless&quot;, and more time trying to get better. I think:\n\n1) There are people who would have more fun and write better software if \nthey did more developer testing. Encouraging everyone to try it is a \ngood thing. I like a Martin Fowler quote: &quot;Often when you come across \nsomething new it can be a good idea to overuse it in order to find out \nit&#39;s boundaries. This is a quite reasonable learning strategy.&quot;\n\n2) There are people who would have more fun and write better software if \nthey did less developer testing. Most of these people, I&#39;ll guess, have \ndeveloper testing forced on them from above. However, if there are \npeople on the list who used to be happy, gung-ho developer testers, and \nnow have seen that they were wrong, I&#39;d love to hear their stories.\n\nDavid Saff\n\n",
