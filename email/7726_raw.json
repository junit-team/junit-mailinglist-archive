We separate the te=\r\nst cases in an own package. Is that best \n&gt;practice?\n\nThere is debate on th=\r\nis. I feel that it is best to test classes through a public interface. Othe=\r\nrs believe that this leads to adding methods &quot;only for testing&quot;. To me, tha=\r\nt generally means that a design change is required. I use the restrictions =\r\nit places on me to improve my design.\n\n&gt;2. When doing this, some methods wi=\r\nth default (package) visiblilty \n&gt;cannot be accessed. But when using the Re=\r\nflection API, this methods \n&gt;can be accessed. Is it okay to use the reflect=\r\nion? Or is it bad \n&gt;style?\n\nI consider it bad style to do so. I only test t=\r\nhrough public interfaces. If I need to make an interface element &quot;only for =\r\ntesting&quot;, then I look for the necessary design change.\n\n&gt;3. What about test=\r\ning private methods? It is normally not possible \n&gt;if the test is in an own=\r\n class. But again I can use the reflection \n&gt;to acess private methods. Shou=\r\nld I do that? Or should I only test \n&gt;methods with public access?\n\nIf a pri=\r\nvate method might break, then that method is doing some useful, complex wor=\r\nk. If it is so useful and complex, then that work belongs on a different ob=\r\nject/class. In that case, the resulting change to the interface makes it pu=\r\nblic.\n\nI don&#39;t use package-level visibility, even though perhaps I could.\n\n=\r\nIf you have many private methods in a class, then those private methods are=\r\n really a smaller class trying to get out of the larger class. This is my e=\r\nxperience.\n\n&gt;Maybe this question has been asked. But I have problems \n&gt;unde=\r\nrstanding the nature of the search results in this forum.\n\nIt is healthy to=\r\n discuss them every so often.\n\n\nJ. B.
