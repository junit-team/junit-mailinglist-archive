    "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1146562859\">Hello,<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; If you really don&#39;t want your tests to be isolated, then I agree this<br/>\n </span></blockquote>is <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; a waste of resources, but I have two questions:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; 1. Do you really want your tests /not/ to be isolated?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>^^^^^^^^^^<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, I want the test cases to be isolated, that is test 2 fails and test<br/>\n5 can still pass... that&#39;s why I need to use the 3rd party tool like<br/>\nJUnit, otherwise, I would write my own test cases.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut I don&#39;t see by create each instance of the test class can ensure<br/>\nisolation... for example, if I have a test #2 that add a new user to the<br/>\nsystem, and I expect an error (password not strict enough, for example),<br/>\nand this test fails, that is it adds the user to the system. Normally,<br/>\nif I have a test that adds a user, I would delete the user afterward,<br/>\nbut for this case, since I didn&#39;t expect the user to be added, I don&#39;t<br/>\ndo the cleaning up. Then on my test #5, I check how many users in the<br/>\nsystem, I would expect none, and the test will fail because the previous<br/>\ntest already added the user by error. (Sure, in this simple case, I can<br/>\ncheck the result and if the user is successfully added, I can delete,<br/>\nbut I just want to give an example, other cases may not as so easy). So,<br/>\nI don&#39;t see a benefit of create a new instance, the tests still get<br/>\naffected.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; 2. Do the tests run quickly enough even if you &quot;waste&quot; the resources?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Well, right now it still runs quick enough... but I don&#39;t know if I<br/>\nwrite more tests into the class it will be fast or not... I have to<br/>\nparse an xml file to get all the parameters for the tests, and I rather<br/>\nparse once for all the tests to keep in the system than to parse over<br/>\nand over the file for each test case because each time a new instance is<br/>\ncreated.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for your clarification, though,<br/>\n<br/>\nVietchau<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Take care.<br/>\n&gt; -- <br/>\n&gt; J.
