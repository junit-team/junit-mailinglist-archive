If so, in which industry?  Sounds academic.  Ho=\r\nw did the quality of her code reflect her theory?  Just wondering.\n\n&gt; Her \n=\r\n&gt; argument was that unit tests, as performed today, are able to check \n&gt; on=\r\nly a specific path on the code, the path stablished by initial \n&gt; condition=\r\ns.\n\nShe was right.  But the persuasion that follows (i.e., &quot;therefore don&#39;t=\r\n bother with unit tests&quot;), is like saying &quot;We all die someday, so we might =\r\nas well live like there&#39;s no tomorrow.&quot;\n\n&gt; Instead, she performed specifica=\r\ncion checking using \n&gt; theorem provers and other advanced tools.\n\nI laughed=\r\n when I saw &quot;theorem provers.&quot;  I&#39;ve never met a hands-on professional in t=\r\nhe software industry (and maybe your colleague was just in a different indu=\r\nstry, even if she developed software) who would even think of theorem prove=\r\nr as a solution for a QA problem at work (unless maybe the problem had to d=\r\no with testing theorems, which isn&#39;t often in the business world).\n\nAdvance=\r\nd tools (by which I project you mean source metrics, UI automation, coverag=\r\ne analysis) are great, but they usually cost money and most people, even so=\r\n-called professionals, are too stupid, overworked, cheap or lazy to use the=\r\nm effectively, if at all.  Those who do know these tools are hard to find a=\r\nnd expensive to hire.  By all means, use them whenever you can, though.  A =\r\nrare individual will use these kinds of tools effectively and drive major c=\r\nhanges through an engineering and/or QA team.  But even then, that person a=\r\nnd the effectiveness of the tools are like the center of rippling circles i=\r\nn a pond -- they diminish as they move out from center.\n\n&gt; This has made me=\r\n think \n&gt; about the utility of unit testing and the level of code reliabili=\r\nty \n&gt; that unit testing can provide.\n&gt; \n&gt; What do you have to say about thi=\r\ns? Could it have an impact on unit \n&gt; testing and, specifically, on JUnit?\n=\r\n\nNo, not a bit.  There&#39;s been plenty of research and writing on the effecti=\r\nveness of different tools, metrics and test techniques.  See anything by Bo=\r\nris Beizer, Glenford Myers, or Robert Binder (anyone can get books by these=\r\n guys on Amazon).  Unit testing is one of many techniques, and is generally=\r\n regarded as a sine qua non of quality code and development methodology.  B=\r\nut it&#39;s no silver bullet.\n\nBasically, you tossed up a real softball questio=\r\nn.  I wouldn&#39;t mind discussing it, but would rather hear some more specific=\r\n, detailed arguments, ideally supported by literature rather than just an a=\r\nnecdote.\n\nBest,\nScott Stirling\nWorkscape, Inc.\n\n***************************=\r\n********************************************\nThis message is intended only =\r\nfor the use of the intended recipient and\nmay contain information that is P=\r\nRIVILEGED and/or CONFIDENTIAL.
