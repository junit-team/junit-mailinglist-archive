I think that a<br/>\n&gt; JUnit-specific annotation, which is not name-confusable with a standard<br/>\n&gt; like @ThreadSafe, seems to be a pretty clear winner.  If we feel strongly<br/>\n&gt; that it should remain consonant with @ThreadSafe, we could make it a static<br/>\n&gt; inner annotation, and reference it as @....<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;m personally find with that as long as the JavaDoc for the annotation<br/>\nmakes it clear that a RunListener implementation annotated with that<br/>\ninterface will be treated differently than one not annotated with that<br/>\ninterface when addListener() and removeListener() is called.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  That might<br/>\n&gt; also have the advantage of making clear that it&#39;s a single-purpose<br/>\n&gt; annotation (I&#39;d rather not, at this point, start speculatively figuring out<br/>\n&gt; what other interfaces might try to pun meanings onto a general-purpose<br/>\n&gt; ThreadSafe annotation)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m a little curious about the third-party library implementation.  Let&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; say I write a package FooTest which is compiled against JUnit 4.12, and it<br/>\n&gt; contains a FooListener I&#39;d like to mark threadsafe.  A client wants to use<br/>\n&gt; it with JUnit 4.11 (she knows she won&#39;t get the concurrent performance<br/>\n&gt; boost, but wants it to just work).  The document seems to assume that if<br/>\n&gt; FooListener has a RunListener.TheadSafe annotation, then our client won&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; have a problem (unless, likely, she actually tries to instantiate all of<br/>\n&gt; the annotations from FooListener in her own code).<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Correct as of JDK 1.5.0_06. See<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3567413/why-doesnt-a-missing-annotation-cause-a-classnotfoundexception-at-runtime\">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3567413/why-doesnt-a-missing-annotation-cause-a-classnotfoundexception-at-runtime</a><br/>\n<br/>\nIt sounds that if the client wants to write code that extends FooListener<br/>\nthen JUnit 4.12 will need to be on the compile-time classpath<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; However, the document<br/>\n&gt; assumes that declaring a marker interface ThreadSafeRunListener _would_<br/>\n&gt; break the client.  Is that true?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I believe it would result in a NoClassDefFoundError exception. It should be<br/>\neasy to verify.<br/>\n<br/>\nNote that it may be hard to write a library that has a compile-time<br/>\ndependency on JUnit 4.12 while being runtime compatible with 4.11 for other<br/>\nreasons.<br/>\n<br/>\n Does FooListener fail at bytecode<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; verification because the verifier wants to make sure that it implements all<br/>\n&gt; of ThreadSafeRunListener&#39;s methods?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>That would be my guess.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- Kevin<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",
