B. Rainsberger&quot; &lt;jbrains@r...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Question: do you instantiate the class directly (using a\n&gt; creation method) or does some framework do it for you?\n&gt; \n&gt; However the class is created, hide that behind an interface,\n&gt; which you can then mock.\n\n[JBR makes some good points and asks the right question.]\n\nYou can build a Facade in front of the object you want to mock -- so \nthat you can mock out the Facade object, which will often be simpler \nthan the real object.\n\nBut the weakness to this approach is that if you&#39;re using a framework \n(a library that your classes extend, or which takes pointers to \nclasses you want to mock), then to build a Facade for the framework, \nyou&#39;ll discover that your Facade must be another complete framework, \nif it can be done at all.  Frameworks can be a real barrier to \ntesting.\n\n\nAnother option:\nCan you subclass the class in question?\n\n\nAnother option:\nDigging *DEEP* into the bag of tricks, here&#39;s something to use when \nnothing else will work:  See Neil Swingler&#39;s javassist class loader \nin the Files section of this group:  \nName &quot;name.swingler.neil.classreloader.zip&quot;, description &quot;reloading \nclassloader that can introduce imposter mock classes&quot;.  It will \nenable you to swap out the offending 3rd party class with one of your \nown making.\n\nIn a similar situation, I used jAdvise (which is built on top of \njavassist) to intercept and modify the internal behavior of the 3rd \nparty class factory so that I could create instances of the class I \nwanted to test, intercept all method calls to it, and disable \neverything it did that had undesirable side effects, replacing method \nbody functionality with my mock implementation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYahoo!
