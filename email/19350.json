I<br/>\n&gt; chose the words carefully because I believe that *some* dogma is<br/>\n&gt; necessary - one has to have a basic position, some ground on which to<br/>\n&gt; stand - hence the phrase &quot;LESS unit testing dogma&quot; as opposed to &quot;NO<br/>\n&gt; unit testing dogma.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Perhaps I&#39;m just reacting strongly to the term &quot;dogma&quot; because I have <br/>\nbeen accused of being dogmatic in the past when I honestly believe I <br/>\nhave not been. That might be it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Testivus itself can be seen as dogmatic in a few places. For example,<br/>\n&gt; &quot;If you write code write tests&quot;, is not exactly wishy-washy about the<br/>\n&gt; fact that developers should test.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Indeed.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; The epigram &quot;Don&#39;t get stuck on unit testing dogma&quot; is aimed as much at<br/>\n&gt; Testivus as it is to anything else, and the key part of the sentence is<br/>\n&gt; &quot;Don&#39;t get STUCK&quot;, don&#39;t let blind following of dogma kill your<br/>\n&gt; creativity or your flexibility.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I hope this clarifies things somewhat.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I suspect the issue is on my side of the fence, and not yours.<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJ.
