As far as I<br/>\n&gt;       understand unit testing using an xUnit framework and as part of the XP<br/>\n&gt;       process.  The existence of test interdependencies (outside of thread<br/>\n&gt;       testing) is a code smell which is avoided.  If the xUnit framework<br/>\n&gt; were<br/>\n&gt;       to support the concept of dependencies it would be promoting a<br/>\n&gt; specific<br/>\n&gt;       code smell which it is intende to avoid.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I don&#39;t think a truer word has been spoken in this thread.  I think you are<br/>\n&gt; spot on. I think I trod in some &quot;test *content* dependency&quot; stigma, when I<br/>\n&gt; was discussing run order &quot;test dependency order&quot;, which I don&#39;t feel is the<br/>\n&gt; same.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I hope that you don&#39;t feel that everyone&#39;s contentious, there is a<br/>\nspirit of the free exchange of ideas.  (I&#39;m referring to your previous<br/>\npost.)  By the way what language are you working in?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; I am not saying my tests depends upon the run of another, no side effects, I<br/>\n&gt; am saying &quot;if my fruit class fails why bother testing my apple class? It has<br/>\n&gt; a rotten core.&quot; It kinda goes back to Bertrand Russell... If I know fruit is<br/>\n&gt; bad, then the fact that apple succeeds doesn&#39;t make it a healthy apple, it<br/>\n&gt; is unknown.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>The way I understand this type of situation with testing in XP.<br/>\n<br/>\n1. I only test one or two classes relative to the one I&#39;m currently<br/>\nworking on.  Periodically (rarely) I run all tests.  A little more often<br/>\nI will run a suite that&#39;s a little bigger, specific to my module.<br/>\n<br/>\n2.  I only test functionality at it&#39;s source.  Meaning that subclasses<br/>\ndon&#39;t test inherited behavior.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIs this what you&#39;re referring to?  Inherited behavior?  I tend to only<br/>\nrun tests on the code I&#39;m working on.  Before I start working I run all<br/>\ntests.  I run all tests when I pull updates from CVS into my source<br/>\ntree.  And I run all tests when I&#39;m done making code changes before I<br/>\ncheck my code in.  But I don&#39;t run all the tests all the time.  I hear<br/>\nwhat you&#39;re saying, however I can&#39;t see it coming up for me during real<br/>\ndevelopment cycles.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Still, I don&#39;t think the idea has a chance of a fair hearing.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Well, ask Ron Jeffries or Kent Beck directly what they think.  Provide<br/>\nan example in code.  We may be missing something, it does happen. I<br/>\ndon&#39;t think any of us is fool enough to think we aren&#39;t.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I agree in principle. That said, I tests in layers, building on each other.<br/>\n&gt; I can&#39;t put 1000 tests in one testcase, just as I would put 1000 class in<br/>\n&gt; one package. I just wanted to bring run order through simple statements of<br/>\n&gt; dependency. I think you see what I was saying, and you&#39;ve explained why I am<br/>\n&gt; getting nowhere.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>When we talk about testing here, are you talking about Unit Testing as a<br/>\ntool to write code?  Or are you talking about QA and/or Acceptance<br/>\nTesting?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Point taken on discouragement, and boy -- yes -- I&#39;ve felt that. ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Hehe, it&#39;s not personal.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I think test content dependency is wrong, but not what I am saying. Either<br/>\n&gt; that, or you decouple yourself from everything you do, a purist goal of no<br/>\n&gt; real world value. Code used code, that is a dependency.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Now, this decoupling point is I think the key.  I think you&#39;d find some<br/>\nreally healthy discussion about decoupling here.  Decoupling is to me<br/>\nthe holy grail for healthy code.  And these people prove daily that unit<br/>\ntesting helps get you there.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; This is all about test content dependency -- side effects -- and I never<br/>\n&gt; meant that. Why get a fruit basket full of errors when fruit is bad? I was<br/>\n&gt; actually trying to reduce this mess of an output to &quot;the *possible* root<br/>\n&gt; cause -- and if nothing else, a place to start cleaning up&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Oh this is what you want...  Well, that may be a reasonable thing. <br/>\n<br/>\nAre all of your test running everynight?  Are all other tests working at<br/>\nall times other than the one you&#39;re working on?  They should be.  Are<br/>\nall tests working before you begin coding?  Do you break and fix you&#39;re<br/>\ntests repeatedly?<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers,<br/>\n<br/>\nDavid B</div>",
