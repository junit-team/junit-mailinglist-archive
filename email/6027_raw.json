Which is better, a bicycle or a banana?  Why don&#39;t you sort your\nlist according to what they actually do?  Code coverage testing, for\nexample, is orthoganal to unit and regression testing.\n\nI don&#39;t know all of those tools, but I know Jtest uses Junit.  And if you&#39;re\nlooking at static analysis tools, you should also take a look at RevJava.\n\n - George\n\n&gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; From: Shay Hassidim [mailto:shay@...]\n&gt; Sent: Tuesday, October 22, 2002 5:16 AM\n&gt; To: junit@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Subject: [junit] How JUnit is better than other Java testing\n&gt; framework?\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi,\n&gt;\n&gt; �\n&gt;\n&gt; I would appreciate info about the advantages of JUnit on top\n&gt; of other Java Testing Frameworks.\n&gt;\n&gt; See other testing frames list below.\n&gt;\n&gt; http://www.aptest.com/resources.html\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Java Source Test Tools\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Product\t Vendor\t Comments\n&gt; GJ-Coverage\t Tester&#39;s Edge\t Coverage tool for Java\n&gt; programs of all types:\n&gt; J2ME, J2SE, and J2EE.
