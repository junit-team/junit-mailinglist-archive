I&#39;ve bought a book\n&gt; from O&#39;Reilly, Java Extreme Programming Cookbook, that was very\n&gt; helpful with JUnit but still doesn&#39;t cover it as deeply as I want...\n\nI hope you&#39;ll get what you&#39;re looking for in JIA. It does go to the\nnitty-gritty details (hence the &quot;in Action&quot; in the title) on real-world\napplication problems. I&#39;m working on improving the TOC on the book web\nsite to give even more details on the content of the book chapters.\n\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;ve subscribed the mailing list, but I haven&#39;t seen any link to\n&gt; download the PDF first chapter... will it be sent to me later?\n\nIf you wish to start reading the book now you have to subscribe to the\nManning MEAP programme (see http://manning.com/massol - bottom of the\npage). \n\nFeel free to write privately to me if you need more information.\n\nThanks\n-Vincent\n\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt; Leonardo Barros\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In junit@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Vincent Massol&quot; &lt;vmassol@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Hi,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m happy to announce that my JUnit in Action book is now available\n&gt; &gt; through the Manning Early Access Programme (MEAP). This means that\n&gt; you\n&gt; &gt; can subscribe to it and get the chapters in PDF format as they are\n&gt; &gt; published (first chapter is already published, 2 others will be\n&gt; &gt; published tomorrow and other chapters will be posted at a rate of 1\n&gt; per\n&gt; &gt; week).\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; More information about the book and MEAP is available at\n&gt; &gt; http://www.manning.com/massol/\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Here&#39;s some information about the book (taken from the book&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; back-cover):\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Developers in the know are switching to a new testing strategy -\n&gt; unit\n&gt; &gt; testing - which interleaves coding and testing in an integrated way.\n&gt; &gt; This has proven to be a powerful combination that results in better\n&gt; &gt; designed software with fewer defects and faster delivery cycles.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; JUnit in Action shows you how to benefit from this strategy using\n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; popular open source testing framework, JUnit. It&#39;s a no fluff\n&gt; discussion\n&gt; &gt; of unit testing techniques and best practices. It gives examples of\n&gt; &gt; tough situations such as how to unit test EJBs, database\n&gt; applications,\n&gt; &gt; JSPs and Taglibs. It discusses unit testing of J2EE applications,\n&gt; and\n&gt; &gt; shows how to test in automated builds.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; What&#39;s Inside:\n&gt; &gt; - Unit testing best practices\n&gt; &gt; - Testing in isolation with mock objects\n&gt; &gt; - In-container testing with Cactus\n&gt; &gt; - Automated builds with Ant and Maven\n&gt; &gt; - Unit testing from within Eclipse\n&gt; &gt; - Test Driven Development principles\n&gt; &gt; - Unit testing\n&gt; &gt;   - Java apps\n&gt; &gt;   - Servlets\n&gt; &gt;   - JSP\n&gt; &gt;   - Taglibs\n&gt; &gt;   - Filters\n&gt; &gt;   - EJB\n&gt; &gt;   - DB apps\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Note that the book can also pre-ordered from Amazon\n&gt; &gt; (http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-\n&gt; /1930110995/qid=1057695644\n&gt; &gt; /sr=8-1/ref=sr_8_1/104-1481474-9343103?v=glance&s=books&n=507846).\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Feel free to ask any question.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Thanks\n&gt; &gt; -Vincent\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ------------------------ Yahoo!
