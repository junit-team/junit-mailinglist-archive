There\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;are versions for integers, longs, shorts, chars, Obejcts,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; etc.  Is this\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;just\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;an oversight?\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; It&#39;s in there as:\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;     assertEquals(double expected, double actual, double delta);\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Ah!\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;I was wanting to use it like:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;      assertEquals(double expected, double actual);\n&gt;\n&gt; Floating-point are messed up. The above method makes a claim about\n&gt; precision that Java can&#39;t live up to. In the spirit of not promising\n&gt; more than you can deliver, it&#39;s best not to use such a method. You can\n&gt; always use a tolerance of 0, but be aware that it&#39;s not necessarily a\n&gt; good idea.\n&gt;\n&gt; Oh, and if you&#39;re not doing calculations with the double values, then\n&gt; why are they doubles? A BigDecimal has the added advantage of not\n&gt; succumbing to the same precision problems. Maybe even a String would\n&gt; do. (I hate having to hack around the language&#39;s inadequacies, but it&#39;s\n&gt; a living.)\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;Or would that be assertSame()?\n&gt;\n&gt; That&#39;s only for Object identity: true if two Objects are the same part\n&gt; of memory; false otherwise.\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;The thing is I was testing to see if the value I put into a class was\n&gt; &gt;the same I got out of a class.  There were no calculations at this\n&gt; &gt;point,\n&gt; &gt;where we would need to worry about the &quot;delta&quot; or +/- uncertainty.\n&gt;\n&gt; Then a delta of 0 would be fine. It makes it clear that you&#39;re not\n&gt; expecting rounding errors to enter into the mix. That communicates\n&gt; something useful.\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;BTW, is there something where we can easily test asymetrical\n&gt; &gt;uncertainties?\n&gt; &gt;You know, something along the lines of +.5/-.1 ?\n&gt;\n&gt; Not built in to JUnit, but it&#39;s easy enough to build...\n&gt;\n&gt; assertWithinRange(final double expected, final double actual, final\n&gt; double upperTolerance, final double lowerTolerance) {\n&gt;     assertTrue( actual &gt;= expected - lowerTolerance && actual &lt;=\n&gt; expected + upperTolerance);\n&gt; }\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; J.
