My experience with\napplying XP practices (particularly automatation and very agressive\nrefactoring) is that the grunt work tends to disappear. I&#39;ve seen\nsituations where you end up with a few smart guys doing all the work,\nand a few &quot;grunts&quot; sitting around that can&#39;t do anything, because they\ndon&#39;t have the technical sophistication to do anything but duplicate\ncode that&#39;s already in the system, making more work, not less, for the\nsenior folks.\n\nIn my current project, we don&#39;t even have any dedicated QA people; the\nprogrammers themselves are responsible for doing all of the QA. We ended\nup with a very heavily automated solution, one we never could have had\nwithout QA staff who were programmers to the point that they could\nchange our software internals to make it more testable.\n\ncjs\n-- \nCurt Sampson  &lt;cjs@...&gt;   +81 90 7737 2974   http://www.NetBSD.org\n    Don&#39;t you know, in this new Dark Age, we&#39;re all light.  --XTC\n\n",
