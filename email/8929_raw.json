The smiley really doesn&#39;t change\nmuch.\n&gt; \n&gt; Ilja, I was attempting to use sarcasm to make a point, and\n&gt; the wink was intended to convey that. I know e-mail is so\n&gt; tone flat, so maybe I shouldn&#39;t have taken the risk, but I\n&gt; was not meaning to be rude. I apologize if that is how it came off.\n\nApology accepted. Guess I was a little bit sensitive when I read your\nmail... ;)\n\n&gt; Also -- if you interpreted this as &quot;junit isn&#39;t good&quot;, please\n&gt; don&#39;t. I was replying to J.B saying if I had lots of core\n&gt; failures then I had other problems,\n\nPlease reread - you will see that he suggested you *might* have other\nproblems.\n\n&gt; and I was saying ---\n&gt; don&#39;t folks w/ problems need good testing?\n\nOh, ok. I accept that you said that, though I still don&#39;t hear it from\nyour original sentence. Thanks for the clarification.\n\n*If* you do have a process/people problem, though, I don&#39;t think that\ntinkering with Junit is the best solution. The mass of failing tests is\nonly a symptom, and by trying to fix it with Junit, you will only cure\nthe symptom, not the real problem. By solving the real problem, the need\nto change the way Junit works will vanish. In fact, aggravating the\nproblem by letting more tests fail due to a single problem might\nactually *help* you solve the real problem (by making it more visible).\n*If* you do have a process/people problem.\n\nSo, tell us more about those failing tests?\n\nRegards, Ilja\n\n\n",
