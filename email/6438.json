This results in making explicitly sure that<br/>\nall<br/>\n&gt; code is actually tested (more so than writing tests that access private<br/>\n&gt; methods directly) - which is the purpose, it is more productive, and it<br/>\nmay<br/>\n&gt; point out unused code or logic errors missed by just assuming that because<br/>\n&gt; the test passed the code has been completely tested. Testing code is only<br/>\nas<br/>\n&gt; good the measured results. Pass/fails are one type of result, code<br/>\ncoverage<br/>\n&gt; metrics are another - the latter more qualitative than the former - and<br/>\nthey<br/>\n&gt; should be used together.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust to be clear what I meant by saying that code-coverage is more<br/>\nqualitative than pass/fail tests.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile code coverage does give a quantitative measure of test coverage, and<br/>\npass/fail tests give a qualitative measure - code coverage will tell you<br/>\nmore about that particular quality of your testing effort than pass/fail<br/>\ntests. If you don&#39;t measure this quality then you won&#39;t truly know how well<br/>\nyou have tested your code - you will only have an educated guess at best.<br/>\n<br/>\nFWIW,<br/>\nLauren<br/>\n<br/>\n=====<br/>\nLooking for an experienced Java/C++ Software Engineer?<br/>\nSee: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://developerdude.mystarband.net/resume.html\">http://developerdude.mystarband.net/resume.html</a> </span></blockquote></div>",
