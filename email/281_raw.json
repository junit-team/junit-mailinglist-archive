It\ngoes in user.home (which on this computer is /u/sartin for me, YMMV :-)\nwhich is the name of the Java property that specifies the home\ndirectory of the User. On Windows it often winds up being something\nstupid (like C:&#92;). On Unix it should be $HOME, aka ~, aka the login\ndirectory for the user.\n\nThe junit.properties file really needs better documentation.\n\nRegards,\n\nRob\n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
