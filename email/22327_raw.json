Essentially, the model has a\nlistener infrastructure and if the user changes the value of the class\nattribute the appropriate event is supposed to fire.  The typical\nsetter/getter looks like this:\n\nclass MyBean extends Listenable {\n    String value;\n\n    public String getValue() {\n        return value;\n    }\n\n    public void setValue(String newValue) {\n        fireAttributeChangedEvent(&quot;value&quot;, value, newValue);\n        value = newValue;\n    }\n}\n\nI need to test that the setters fire the appropriate event, and that the\nevent attribute name is correct.  I want a test harness to essentially\ncollect all the setters and getters and change the value to ensure that\nthe event is sent as expected.  Then I want to run that against all my\ndomain models.\n\nMy understanding is that I need to generate a suite, and add the test\ninstances to that suite.  I&#39;ve upgraded to JUnit 4 because I think it is\ndesigned better.  I&#39;m just at a loss as to how to start.  With JUnit 4,\nindividual tests are marked with an annotation.\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n",
