I&#39;m still looking into various\n&gt; possibilities of approaching the problem:\n&gt; \n&gt; Problem:\n&gt; &quot;This is a 5 year old system (or better,&quot;evolved over 5 years&quot;),\n&gt; into production and has been working satisfactorily. (written using\n&gt; Java, EJB, JMS, Sybase and is pretty huge one). So far there is no\n&gt; automated testing employed to test this system. Now that I have\n&gt; recently been into this team, I&#39;ll have to come up with some way of\n&gt; automating the testing process.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m looking at various possibilities. Are there any general\n&gt; principles to make old code, Unit test compliant?\n\nYes, there are. Michael Feathers has done considerable work in this \narea, but I don&#39;t know the publishing status of his &quot;Working Effectively \nwith Legacy Code&quot;. The things I have been recommending so far are \ntechniques he writes about. My book, &quot;JUnit Recipes&quot; includes various \nrecipes for testing legacy J2EE components.\n\nWhat I recommended in my previous response is the kind of thing that \nyou&#39;ll find in either book.\n-- \nJ.
