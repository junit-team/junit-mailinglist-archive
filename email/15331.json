I not only pay pretty close attention to <br/>\nwhat users are asking me. I listen to what users are asking from my <br/>\ncompetition. (fringe benefit of open source and open development). <br/>\nUnless they&#39;re a lot of people working on their own XML frameworks in <br/>\ntheir basements, there&#39;s just not that much need for extending the <br/>\nframework beyond what I provide. Even in frameworks that allow a lot <br/>\nmore extensibility of this type (DOM comes to mind) people don&#39;t <br/>\nactually seem to take advantage of that possibility.<br/>\n<br/>\nInheritance is vastly overrated. The number of people who actually want <br/>\nto change a class&#39;s behavior is extremely small in most cases.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; And even if you could know this number for sure, just accept that other<br/>\n&gt; people have different experiences than you do (among which, most of the<br/>\n&gt; people who are participating in this thread, it seems).<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Actually, I&#39;d turn that back on you. Different people have different <br/>\nexperiences and different needs, but these experiences and needs are not <br/>\nequal in numbers or importance. The programmers who hang out on mailing <br/>\nlists like this one (especially this one) are a very highly <br/>\nself-selected group. They are in many ways much more theoretically and <br/>\nabstractly inclined than 90% of working developers. Most programmers who <br/>\nwrite books about programming and who design and publish libraries are <br/>\nreally way beyond the typical working developer. Not a surprise: some <br/>\nprogrammers are experts in programming and some are experts in insurance <br/>\nor financial derivatives or shock wave modeling or something else. We <br/>\ncan&#39;t all be experts in everything. But these mailing lists attract the <br/>\nmeta-programmers: the programmers who are experts in programming.<br/>\n<br/>\nGuess what? We&#39;re weird, even among programmers. We are much more <br/>\ncomfortable with abstraction than even other typical programmers. Design <br/>\npatterns, factory methods, interfaces, inheritance, polymorphism, and <br/>\nanything beyond simple data encapsulation is way beyond the comfort <br/>\nlevel of most actual programmers. A library designed for ease of use by <br/>\na typical programmer needs to focus on the 90% rather than the 10%. If <br/>\nyou gauge the audience for a tool by the programmers who hang out in <br/>\nforums like this one, you&#39;re going to miss the vast body of programmers <br/>\nwho don&#39;t.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat you are in effect arguing is that you don&#39;t want to be held back by <br/>\nthe needs of the many. You can safely use extra extension points, and <br/>\ntherefore they should be there. But most programmers don&#39;t feel this <br/>\nway. Most of them can at least safely ignore the extra methods. They <br/>\nprobably won&#39;t shoot themselves in the foot even if we give them plenty <br/>\nof bullets. However the sheer complexity of adding all these extra <br/>\nextension points make the classes so much harder to use that the cost to <br/>\nthe many outweighs the benefits to the few.<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes we do need subclassing and extra extension points, but not <br/>\nthat many and not that often; even when considering only the most <br/>\nabstractly inclined of programmers. Extension points are not without <br/>\ncost. There&#39;s is or should be a significant hurdle to be jumped before <br/>\nadding a new published method. Even if the method is inherently useful <br/>\nand has no corresponding problems, it still needs to be useful enough. <br/>\nIt&#39;s not enough that one or a few people might use a method. It needs to <br/>\nbe pretty clear that large percentage of a library&#39;s users are going to <br/>\ntake advantage of the feature, or that it be extremely important to a <br/>\nsmaller but still sizeable percentage.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe can argue about exactly where to put the line: how useful to how many <br/>\npeople does a method need to be before we add it. However that number is <br/>\nquite a bit higher then 1. It is certainly higher than 0. That a feature <br/>\nmight someday be used by someone, but we aren&#39;t quite sure who or when, <br/>\nis not sufficient grounds to include it. There needs to be a positive <br/>\ndecision that a feature will be useful before it&#39;s added. Featuritis is <br/>\nas damaging to APIs as it is to applications.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n﻿Elliotte Rusty Harold  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:elharo@...\">elharo@...</a><br/>\nXML in a Nutshell 3rd Edition Just Published!<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.cafeconleche.org/books/xian3/\">http://www.cafeconleche.org/books/xian3/</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0596007647/cafeaulaitA/ref=nosim\">http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0596007647/cafeaulaitA/ref=nosim</a></div>",
