Interfaces and abstract classes both have their place. It&#39;s hard to find simple rules to decide what to use where.<br/>\n<br/>\nI personally don&#39;t see having TestRule as an abstract class causing a burdon for competent developers. Since TestRule has only one method, it&#39;s very easy to use delegation to share code. You could have your Rule have many methods that delegate to another object, or your Rule could have a single accessor to get the delegate, or you could create the Rule by calling a method on another object.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn any case, what we could use is data. Can someone give concrete cases were making TestRule an abstract class has caused problems? Let&#39;s get them out now, before 4.9 releases.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- Kevin<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a>, Malte Finsterwalder &lt;malte@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I would rather use an interface and not an abstract class.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; My reasoning:<br/>\n&gt; I see the tradeoff between:<br/>\n&gt; Give the most power and flexibility to the competent programmer that<br/>\n&gt; knows what he is doing: Interface<br/>\n&gt; Prevent stupid misuse errors: Abstract class.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I would always prefer the first solution, so I would like the<br/>\n&gt; interface version much better.<br/>\n&gt; Prevent the stupid misuse through good documentation.
