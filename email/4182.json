We have been <br/>\ndeveloping our product for about two years now, and have been trying <br/>\nto be pretty good about the developmental practices.  We have coding <br/>\nstandards, good architecture and frameworks in place, and allot of <br/>\ntallented developers. What we don&#39;t have is a solid suite of unit <br/>\ntests.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat happened is at the beginning of the project management was <br/>\nonboard with the schedule that we demanded that included time for <br/>\nbuilding the unit tests.  For about 6 month now that is no longer a <br/>\ncase.  We have not written unit tests for the past 6 month.  The <br/>\ntests that have been written are long out of sync. with the codebase, <br/>\nto the point where everyone has them excluded from compilation.<br/>\n<br/>\nI really would like us to get back on track and developer a better <br/>\nquality product; alos, god knows our QA need some help.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, to keep a long story short, what I am looking for is for best <br/>\npractices and guidlines on developintg unit tests for various types <br/>\nof classes (Regular classes, Servlets, EJBs, MDBs, XML processing).  <br/>\nIs there a framework that somebody has developed on top of the JUnit. If<br/>\nnot, I would be glad to build one, assuming it will not require <br/>\ntoo much time.  Being a great fan of reuse, I would rather use an <br/>\nalready created testing framework.  JUnit is great, but it is very <br/>\nsimple and does not have guidance on testing Data Access code, ...<br/>\n<br/>\nIf any of you can give me a list of books, articles, code samples, <br/>\nreferences to other web-sites; I will greatly appreciate it.<br/>\nI am realy glad that people like Erich Gamma and Kent Beck are out <br/>\nthere to help the rest of us get our acts together; however, there is <br/>\nstill some much more that could be done to make life easier for <br/>\nfast-pased development teams like the one I am working for.<br/>\n<br/>\nRegards, Mikhail Shnayderman.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nTo unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\">junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nYour use of Yahoo!
