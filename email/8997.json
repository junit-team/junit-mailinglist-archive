But this is so unusual for this list (thinking over the <br/>\npast few years), it will probably return to normal soon by themselves.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d suggest some folks should possibly get an email client able to <br/>\ngroup mails by subject and then delete only those threads they aren&#39;t <br/>\ninterested in. I do this, and I was interested in the thread you are <br/>\nprobably referring to, so I am glad that it was on the list, not in <br/>\nprivate email.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut that&#39;s just me - I am known for my addicition to lengthy <br/>\ndiscussions... ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nNo hard feelings, Ilja</div>",
