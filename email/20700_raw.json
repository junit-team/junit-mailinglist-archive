An issue I want to change.\nI read some articles and took some =\r\norientation on Frank Westphal&#39;s\nvery good book about that topic. But in pra=\r\nctice, I always run into\nsimilar problems, which seem to disturb my view of=\r\n unit testing. So\nsome thought and questions I would like to discuss.\n\n1. R=\r\necently I read that a unit test is no one if you have to touch\nnetwork, db =\r\nor filesystem. I understand the point that these accesses\nreally can slow t=\r\nhe tests down and usually need extra work of\nconfiguration, but how to avoi=\r\nd this?\nAn example of my daily work. I have quite a common task: Fetch some=\r\n\nxmls from an ftp server, parse the content and map it into db and vice\nver=\r\nsa. So the business logic is quite thin. More important is good\nexception h=\r\nandling and the transport of all data in the right structures. \n\nActually t=\r\nhe slowdown of a real ftp transport and the configuration\nand injection ove=\r\nrhead of the db-connection is a major drawback. But\non the other hand I see=\r\n no good way to mock the behaviour of these\nendpoints. \nI could try to mock=\r\n a database, but how to test, if an sql-statement\nis correct (especially fo=\r\nr a wider range of queries)?\nIt also is a very hard work to write stubs or =\r\nmocks, which can answer\nwith all error-states an ftp-server/network can gen=\r\nerate (timeout,\naccess denied, authentication etc) to test the correct erro=\r\nr handling\nof my code.\n\n2. Another question points to a basic principle of =\r\nunit testing: the\nopening of a class in small and public methods. I see an =\r\nadvantage in\nthe possibility to inject every aspect of a class (manually or=\r\n e.g.\nvia spring) and the code can benefit from a better readability throug=\r\nh\na chain of self-explanatory method calls.\nBut in some cases I want to hid=\r\ne implementation details from the user.\nTaking my Importer/Exporter example=\r\n a second time, it is more a cron\nscript than an application: Doing a defin=\r\ned job in a robust and\nunderstandable manner but neither designed as a basi=\r\ns for wide\nenhancements nor for ultimate flexibility. \nSo there are methods=\r\n which start the whole work of an importer over\nthe whole lifecycle (connec=\r\nt, fetch data, map data etc). Methods,\nwhich are necessary for getting the =\r\nobject in a usable state (e.g.\nconnection established) are hidden away. To =\r\nensure that there must be\nthe correct state before executing the main task =\r\nI can lead the user\nwith parameterized constructors (e.g. MyImporter(host, =\r\nport)).\nTo say it more generally I think that it is a common way to restric=\r\nt\nthe use of classes which need to be handled in correct order because\nof t=\r\nheir state. This saves a lot of additional exception handling\n(e.g. executi=\r\nng before connecting). \nBut following this thought it gets very hard to iso=\r\nlate testing units.\nEven when I separate the tasks within the class to unit=\r\ns (connecting,\ndisconnecting etc) they would be not accessible and would ne=\r\ned to be\ntested from within.\n\nThis is only a very simple and not a perfect =\r\nexample but I think my\npoint should be clear. I hope that some of you take =\r\nsome time to read\nit. I really would appreciate some thoughts!\n\n\n",
