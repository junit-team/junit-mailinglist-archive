For entity ejbs, the \ncontainer does a\n&gt; lot of work that I didn&#39;t want to duplicate, so I don&#39;t use this \nmechanism\n&gt; there.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; If we run the EJB locally, a MyEJBImpl is instantiated on the client \nside as\n&gt; if it was a simple object.\n&gt; If we run the EJB remote, a MyEJBStub is instantiated and talks to \nthe\n&gt; MyEJBImpl that lives in the container on the server side.\n&gt; \n\nThanks for the diagram!  I know those are a pain to draw.\n\nI understand much more clearly what you are doing now.  A couple of \nquestions:\n\na) Does your &lt;&lt; MyEJBIF &gt;&gt; throw remote exceptions in the local case?  \n\ni.e. if I am the client and I want to run locally, I wouldn&#39;t expect \nany remote exceptions.  I have seen this handled both ways where the \nRemoteException are caught and where they are thrown to the client \n(regardless of local or distributed).\n\nb) Would it be possible to use the EJB&#39;s Remote Interface as your &lt;&lt; \nMyEJBIF &gt;&gt;?\n\nWhat is the difference between &lt;&lt; MyEJBIF &gt;&gt; and the EJB&#39;s Remote \nInterface?\n\nThe first time I approached this problem I made a special business \ninterface for my objects and then realized I could just use the EJB \nRemote interface itself.  The only draw back is my client must catch \nRemote, Create, Finder EJB Exceptions (even though they may not be \nthrown) in the local case.  \n\nPS I like you choice of names i.e. biPolar...  I have an Electrical \nEngineering background and it brings back memories of Bipolar Junction \nTransistors (BJT&#39;s).  I understood exactly what you meant.\n\nCheers\n\nJonathan\n\n\n",
