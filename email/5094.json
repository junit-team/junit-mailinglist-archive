Let&#39;s handle this one really well in the FAQ, including all <br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;opinions, and point future instances of the question to the FAQ.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;This entry is weak in the draft FAQ right now:<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;----<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;Why does JUnit only report the first failure in a single test?<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;A single test method may contain multiple assertions, but the test <br/>\n&gt;&gt;method fails as soon as any of its assertions fail.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;By design, JUnit assumes there&#39;s no reason to report multiple <br/>\n&gt;&gt;failures in a given test method. Once a test fails, it can only fail <br/>\n&gt;&gt;more and clutter the output with side-effect failures.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Reporting multiple failures in a single test is generally a sign that the <br/>\n&gt;test does too much, compared to what a unit test ought to do. Usually this <br/>\n&gt;means either that the test is really a functional/acceptance/customer test <br/>\n&gt;or, if it is a unit test, then it is too big a unit test.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;JUnit is designed to work best with a number of small tests. It executes each <br/>\n&gt;test within a separate instance of the test class. It reports failure on each <br/>\n&gt;test. Shared setup code is most natural when sharing between tests. This is a <br/>\n&gt;design decision that permeates JUnit, and when you decide to report multiple <br/>\n&gt;failures per test, you begin to fight against JUnit. This is not recommended.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Long tests are a design smell and indicate the likelihood of a design <br/>\n&gt;problem. Kent Beck is fond of saying in this case that &quot;there is an <br/>\n&gt;opportunity to learn something about your design.&quot; We would like to see a <br/>\n&gt;pattern language develop around these problems, but it has not yet been <br/>\n&gt;written down.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Finally, note that a single test with multiple assertions is isomorphic to a <br/>\n&gt;test case with multiple tests:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;One test method, three assertions:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;public class MyTestCase extends TestCase {<br/>\n&gt;    public void testSomething() {<br/>\n&gt;        // Set up for the test, manipulating local variables<br/>\n&gt;        assertTrue(condition1);<br/>\n&gt;        assertTrue(condition2);<br/>\n&gt;        assertTrue(condition3);<br/>\n&gt;    }<br/>\n&gt;}<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Three test methods, one assertion each:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;public class MyTestCase extends TestCase {<br/>\n&gt;    // Locale variables become instance variables<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;    protected void setUp() {<br/>\n&gt;        // Set up for the test, manipulating instance variables<br/>\n&gt;    }<br/>\n&gt;    <br/>\n&gt;    public void testCondition1() {<br/>\n&gt;        assertTrue(condition1);<br/>\n&gt;    }<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;    public void testCondition2() {<br/>\n&gt;        assertTrue(condition2);<br/>\n&gt;    }<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;    public void testCondition3() {<br/>\n&gt;        assertTrue(condition3);<br/>\n&gt;    }<br/>\n&gt;}<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;The resulting tests use JUnit&#39;s natural execution and reporting mechanism <br/>\n&gt;and, failure in one test does not affect the execution of the other tests. <br/>\n&gt;You generally want exactly one test to fail for any given bug, if you can <br/>\n&gt;manage it.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--<br/>\n&gt;J.
