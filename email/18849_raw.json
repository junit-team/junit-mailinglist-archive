This seems to be a serious source of contention among\n&gt;  programmers: we call it testing, but we mean design, and when we do\n&gt;  design, testing is a secondary consideration, and yet testing is important.\n&gt;\n&gt;  Rather than repackaging TDD and calling it BDD, hoping that Sapir-Whorf\n&gt;  will save us from our own sloppiness, maybe it&#39;s time for separate tools\n&gt;  for design and testing. I have no idea how that would work, but perhaps\n&gt;  it would help us all get along.\n&gt;\n&gt;  So I&#39;d like a way to separate my design and testing activities when I do\n&gt;  TDD. For example, when I test-drive behavior that doesn&#39;t yet exist, I&#39;m\n&gt;  almost always designing; but when I fill in the holes by adding a test\n&gt;  for a case that should already pass, I&#39;m testing. Perhaps it would be\n&gt;  better to separate those somehow.\n\nThis seems elegant - I think there is a role for testing outside of\nTDD. In those cases I would like automated help in generating data\n(perhaps even Mocks) to test various cases. This would help test if\nstatements (they need to exist occaisonally), edge cases etc.\nBasically I want to automate as much boiler plate stuff as I can, so\nthat I can focus on the design.\n\nCheers\nMark Levison\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nBlog: http://www.notesfromatooluser.com/\nMost Popular posts:\nScrum in a Nutshell or 5 minutes to learn Scrum\nhttp://www.notesfromatooluser.com/2006/11/scrum_in_a_nuts.html\nGetting Things Done!!!
