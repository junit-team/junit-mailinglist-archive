I&#39;d prefer to be able to write a &quot;text output stream&quot; without<br/>\n&gt; &gt; having to jump through hoops to separate one line from the next<br/>\n&gt; &gt; in my text strings. Similarly I&#39;d like to be able to read &quot;lines&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; from a &quot;text file&quot; without having to dither about how those lines<br/>\n&gt; &gt; are separated.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; You can in fact do that. Use XML, or use some other library that<br/>\n&gt; recognizes &#92;r, &#92;n, and &#92;r&#92;n as legal line breaks.

Files and data<br/>\n&gt; are not to tied to platforms. In 2005 anything that is tied to platforms<br/>\n&gt; is guaranteed to fail. (OK, maybe not anything, but most things.) Just<br/>\n&gt; because your code is running on Windows does not guarantee that the line<br/>\n&gt; breaks in every file you read will be &#92;r&#92;n. Just because you&#39;re not on<br/>\n&gt; Windows doesn&#39;t mean they won&#39;t be.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It&#39;s easy enough to cope with line boundaries when reading (modulo<br/>\nconcerns about fancy file formats that the OS may have). The<br/>\noriginal niggle was what to do about them when /writing/, if one<br/>\nwants to generate text output in the local preferred convention<br/>\nand to have literal strings with line-separators in them. <br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nChris &quot;electric hedgehog&quot; Dollin<br/>\nThe software engineer&#39;s song: &quot;who knows where the time goes&quot;.</div>",
