This is a problem I face a lot writing Eclipse GUI&#39;s.  <br/>\nEvery Control must have a Composite parent, but every Composite is a <br/>\nControl, leading to a chicken and egg problem.  There&#39;s three approaches <br/>\nyou can take here:<br/>\n<br/>\n1) The simplest is to run your tests as JUnit Plugin Tests.  This will <br/>\nrun your tests in the context of a running eclipse instance.  You can <br/>\nthen programmatically create your View, and test its results, or you can <br/>\nembed your Control in the top-level window, the Shell, just to get it <br/>\nconstructed: <br/>\ncreatePartControl(PlatformUI.getWorkbench().getDisplay().getShell())<br/>\n<br/>\n2) Booting Eclipse takes a long time, and involves so many framework <br/>\ncalls that you&#39;re rapidly testing 20 times more functionality than you <br/>\nreally want.  It would be nice to be able to create Controls without <br/>\nbooting Eclipse, but it&#39;s difficult, because it requires linking with <br/>\nnative libraries.  Thanks to your message, I went out to Google for the <br/>\numpteenth time to see if a smarter person had tackled this question, and <br/>\nthey have!<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.eclipsezone.com/eclipse/forums/t49342.html\">http://www.eclipsezone.com/eclipse/forums/t49342.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\n3) If by chance you have business logic embedded in your UI, and that&#39;s <br/>\nwhat you&#39;re testing, do consider the Humble Dialog pattern (just ask <br/>\nGoogle).<br/>\n<br/>\nHope this helps.  Share and Enjoy,<br/>\n<br/>\n    David Saff</div>",
