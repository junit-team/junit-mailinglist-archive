We \nare now looking at=\r\n Agitator and trying to determine if, and how, it \nfits into our current pr=\r\nactices.  I was wondering how others have \ndecided to use Agitator (or not =\r\nuse it).  Some of the issues we are \nstruggling with:\n\n1.  Agitator looks l=\r\nike it can eliminate the need to write most JUnit \ntests (except true persi=\r\nstence testing).  The downside is that we \nwould be left with only Agitator=\r\n config files that contain our \nbusiness logic assertions.  This seems like=\r\n a big leap to take, given \nthat if Agitar goes away, we have no JUnit.\n\n2.=\r\n  Agitator mocks and factories look easy to create, but look like \nthey are=\r\n only useful in the context of Agitator.  I couldn&#39;t use them \nfor other pu=\r\nrposes (e.g. Fitnesse, JUnit).\n\n3.  Having my business logic tests in JUnit=\r\n means they are in an \nunderstood format and things such as inputs and expe=\r\ncted results are \nclearly visible and grouped with each test.  My impressio=\r\nn of \nAgitator is that this wouldn&#39;t be as clear.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
