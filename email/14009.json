For this purpose I wish to add a piece of code to be called after<br/>\n&gt; &gt; each test has been run. I noticed that TestResult has a possibility to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; add such a piece of code through TestListener.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; However, adding the listener requires that I have access to the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; TestResult objects created. And these in turn are created in the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; TestRunner instances. And if I run my tests from an IDE or Ant, the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; runner used is out of my control.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I am thinking I could just modify the TestResult to always add my<br/>\n&gt; &gt; listener in its constructor or something similar (maybe a static<br/>\n&gt; &gt; listener..). But I am not sure if this is the best solution.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; So I guess my questions are:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  -Did I understand the code correctly?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  -Is there a way for me to easily add such a listener, hopefully without<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   messing too much with the JUnit sources?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  -Can anyone think of reasons why modifying TestResult to contain my<br/>\n&gt; &gt; listener would not work? Are there some cases or environments that modify<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the execution so they dont use the standard TestResult? For example Ant,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; etc..<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Is this something that can&#39;t just be put into tearDown(), which is<br/>\n&gt; invoked after each test runs, regardless of whether it succeeded?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote> Hmm didn&#39;t really think about that. I&#39;ll have to try it out. Sound so<br/>\nsimple it might work :).<br/>\n<br/>\nPerhaps if I just modify the tearDown() method in JUnit&#39;s TestCase class<br/>\nto execute my data collection method it should work without me needing to<br/>\nmodify the different projects code.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,</div>",
