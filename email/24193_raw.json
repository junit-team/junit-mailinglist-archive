I also hope it will be kept simple, at least in the core. I really\nhave not found any need for the rules, parametrizations, and whatnot.\nSupport for easier extension of the tool would be great and maybe that\nwould be the main thing for me. Provide a chance to extend in whatever\ndirection, including IDE integration without knowing everything about the\ntests before running them, and that would be great for the core for me.\nThen people could pile their stuff on the top. So, maybe a bit more modular\nbut preferrably not requiring me to download 20 jars making the install not\nso simple..\n\nTeemu\n\n\nOn 19 December 2012 16:44, Bill Venners &lt;bill@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt; Hi All,\n&gt;\n&gt; I agree with Malte that the name &quot;JUnit 5&quot; would make most sense to users,\n&gt; despite the problems with version numbers. I&#39;d enjoy helping with the\n&gt; effort when the time comes. I&#39;m an old Java guy still, despite my recent\n&gt; focus on Scala, and I could bring some experience of actually using in a\n&gt; testing context features similar to those that will be made available to a\n&gt; JUnit 5 via Java 8 (lamdas, extension methods, etc.).\n&gt;\n&gt; Bill\n&gt;\n&gt; On Wed, Dec 19, 2012 at 1:57 AM, Malte Finsterwalder &lt;\n&gt; malte@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; **\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Hi David,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; On 18 December 2012 18:35, David Saff &lt;saff@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Thinking more about this, I think that what defines JUnit, as Neale\n&gt; &gt; points\n&gt; &gt; &gt; out, is its philosophy, and the community of people who buy into that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; philosophy. So I think that when considering a new version, we could\n&gt; &gt; &gt; certainly consider strongly following the design examples of other\n&gt; &gt; &gt; frameworks, like Jumi or others, but in the end, a JUnit 5 would be\n&gt; built\n&gt; &gt; &gt; piece by piece by submissions to this community.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; JUnit for me is still the de facto standard for unit testing in Java.\n&gt; &gt; It&#39;s integrated in all the major IDEs from the start.\n&gt; &gt; It&#39;s known by pretty much every Java Developer.\n&gt; &gt; Even if they don&#39;t use it or don&#39;t use it well, it&#39;s still the first unit\n&gt; &gt; testing framework that comes to mind.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; This has probably to do with the trust in the people who guide and\n&gt; develop\n&gt; &gt; JUnit. But I really don&#39;t know\n&gt; &gt; Moving towards JUnit 5 I think it will be hard to to loose this status, I\n&gt; &gt; think.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; When it makes sense to use an existing library (and licences allow), I\n&gt; see\n&gt; &gt; no principal problem in reusing something like Jumi for JUnit 5.\n&gt; &gt; I have no idea, whether that makes sense at all, since I didn&#39;t look into\n&gt; &gt; Jumi.\n&gt; &gt; I just don&#39;t think that JUnit 5 should necessarily be &quot;built piece by\n&gt; piece\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; by submissions to this community&quot;.\n&gt; &gt; Using Hamcrest inside JUnit 4 was a great move and it is an external\n&gt; &gt; library.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I think also that the compatibility between JUnit 3 and JUnit 4 was\n&gt; &gt; &gt; instrumental in making it useful for teams, and I&#39;d like to see a\n&gt; similar\n&gt; &gt; &gt; focus on backward compatibility moving forward.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I also think, that backwards compatibility for executing JUnit 4 Tests at\n&gt; &gt; least is a must.\n&gt; &gt; If I can&#39;t gracefully migrate towards JUnit 5 I would have a problem and\n&gt; &gt; many other as well.\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m not sure whether we still need JUnit 3 support, though.\n&gt; &gt; JUnit 4 is old enough, that I think we could kill JUnit 3 if that makes\n&gt; &gt; things easier.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; One last thought: one of the biggest confusions about JUnit 4 was the\n&gt; &gt; fact\n&gt; &gt; &gt; that it was both a version number referring to a new release of a\n&gt; &gt; software\n&gt; &gt; &gt; package, _and_ the only useful name for the collection of new libraries\n&gt; &gt; &gt; included in that release. Starting in JUnit 5, I think a different\n&gt; naming\n&gt; &gt; &gt; scheme would be quite helpful. Choosing a scheme that I&#39;m positive we\n&gt; &gt; &gt; _won&#39;t_ use, for example:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; - The runner and interfaces introduced in JUnit &lt;= 3 would be JUnit\n&gt; &gt; Cupcake\n&gt; &gt; &gt; - The runner and interfaces introduced in JUnit 4 would be JUnit Donut\n&gt; &gt; &gt; - The runner and interfaces introduced in JUnit 5 would be JUnit Eclair\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I think JUnit 4 was a great naming.\n&gt; &gt; I made clear, that the new software release also brough the new\n&gt; libraries.\n&gt; &gt; I don&#39;t see that as a problem.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; And doing the same with JUnit 5 would be consistent with that.\n&gt; &gt; So when JUnit 5 changes the interface for tests and also brings a new\n&gt; &gt; release (of course) I would still call it JUnit 5 and everyone should\n&gt; know\n&gt; &gt; what&#39;s meant.\n&gt; &gt; I think it would be much more confusing If you started to introduce two\n&gt; &gt; names. One for the software release version and one for the interface.\n&gt; &gt; Then I would have to say something like: I use JUnit 5 but I&#39;m writing\n&gt; &gt; JUnit Donut style tests? And who can remember those strange names\n&gt; anyways?\n&gt; &gt; Do you remember the last two names of Eclipse and can sort them? Or any\n&gt; &gt; other product that uses naming for that matter?\n&gt; &gt; I can&#39;t.\n&gt; &gt; But I can easily remember JUnit 3, 4 and 5. And I have no problem in\n&gt; &gt; stating that I use JUnit 5 with JUnit 4 style tests.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; On the other hand I strongly believe that, whatever you do, it will work\n&gt; &gt; out ok for two reasons:\n&gt; &gt; 1) JUnit is just too established and too well known.\n&gt; &gt; 2) I trust in Kent and you, to stear JUnit in a good direction and to\n&gt; &gt; listen to the community.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Greetings,\n&gt; &gt; Malte\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; --\n&gt; Bill Venners\n&gt; Artima, Inc.\n&gt; http://www.artima.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
