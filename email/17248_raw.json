You should\n&gt; assume that each test method will be run with a fresh test method in JUnit.\n&gt; This has been part of the architecture from the beginning and I don&#39;t see\n&gt; any reason to change it. The principle behind this choice is that tests\n&gt; should be order-independent. Running with separate instances supports\n&gt; independence.\n\nThat&#39;s fine. As I think about it, there&#39;s still another reason not to \ninitialize objects in the constructor: test instance creation happens \nwell before the test runs, so if too much initialization happens in the \nconstructor, one might run out of memory before running any tests. Also, \nthis could wreak havoc with test resources. Imagine what happens if each \ntest tries to grab (and hold) a database connection!\n\nSo it&#39;s good news: there&#39;s still at least one very good reason why \ninitializing in the constructor is different from using setUp(). I guess \nI&#39;ve been right for the wrong reason. :)\n\nThanks for the clarification.\n\nStill, seeing as NUnit pools test instances, I think it&#39;s worth not \nrelying on JUnit creating separate test instances.\n\nTake care.\n-- \nJ.
