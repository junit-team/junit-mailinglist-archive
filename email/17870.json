If I have written my asserts well, I usually don&#39;t even need to look at the logging, because I will know exactly what went wrong.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope this helps and good luck on the migration.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nDianne<br/>\n<br/>\n-------------- Original message -------------- <br/>\nFrom: &quot;isowitz&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:isowitz@...\">isowitz@...</a>&gt; <br/>\nI have to rewrite existing tests in JUnit tests. The old tests logs <br/>\nwith a java.util.logging.Logger, e.g. starttime, start sendind data, <br/>\nstart recieving data, the recieved data etc. - in a word they logs <br/>\nall that can be logged. <br/>\nShould I use the java.util.logging.Logger for JUnit too or is that <br/>\nthe bad way?<br/>\n<br/>\nYou spoke about reports of my result. What other kind of reports <br/>\nexists?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a>, didoss@... wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; What do you mean by logging,...do you mean reports of your results -<br/>\nthen Google JUnitReport.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -------------- Original message -------------- <br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;isowitz&quot; &lt;isowitz@...&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I have a problem with logging JUnit tests. In a package I have a <br/>\n&gt; AllTests class that calls several tests. The result of that tests <br/>\n&gt; should be logged.<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m not familiar with JUnit or logging so I try to find examples in <br/>\nthe <br/>\n&gt; web. Unfortunately i found no examples or hints for me.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; How do you log your JUnit results? <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed] </span></blockquote></div>",
