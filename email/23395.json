It is<br/>\n&gt;&gt; a useful concept, especially when testing in a BDD style. People like to<br/>\n&gt;&gt; sometimes &quot;flesh out their ideas&quot; by writing descriptive test names for<br/>\n&gt;&gt; which neither the test code nor the code under test as yet exists. I do<br/>\n&gt;&gt; support pending tests in ScalaTest, and when running through JUnit call them<br/>\n&gt;&gt; ignored tests. That&#39;s the closest thing to pending already understood by<br/>\n&gt;&gt; tools that integrate with JUnit. So if you add something called pending, you<br/>\n&gt;&gt; could still possibly report it as an ignored test. To see an example, look<br/>\n&gt;&gt; on line 80 of RunNotifierReporter:<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://code.google.com/p/scalatest/source/browse/trunk/src/main/scala/org/scalatest/junit/RunNotifierReporter.scala\">http://code.google.com/p/scalatest/source/browse/trunk/src/main/scala/org/scalatest/junit/RunNotifierReporter.scala</a><br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Basically I do this:<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; // Closest thing we can do with pending is report an ignored test<br/>\n&gt;&gt;        case TestPending(ordinal, suiteName, suiteClassName, testName,<br/>\n&gt;&gt; formatter, payload, threadName, timeStamp) =&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; runNotifier.fireTestIgnored(Description.createSuiteDescription(testDescriptionName(suiteName,<br/>\n&gt;&gt; suiteClassName, testName)))<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; So what you could do as a JUnit enhancement is for a pending test call<br/>\n&gt;&gt; fireTestIgnored with perhaps a subclass of Description called<br/>\n&gt;&gt; PendingDescription. So existing tools would still understand it is a<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Description, but newer versions could detect it is a PendingDescription and<br/>\n&gt;&gt; act accordingly. Or just add some state to Description that old tools would<br/>\n&gt;&gt; ignore and new ones could use to differentiate pending tests from ignored<br/>\n&gt;&gt; ones. Something like that would allow you to add the new functionality in a<br/>\n&gt;&gt; backwards compatible way.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; In ScalaTest, for example, I could later change the code above so it sends<br/>\n&gt;&gt; such a PendingDescription notification (though it would be a good long time<br/>\n&gt;&gt; before I did that because I wouldn&#39;t want to force people to upgrade their<br/>\n&gt;&gt; JUnit for a good while.)<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Bill<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; On Sat, Apr 16, 2011 at 1:13 PM, David Saff&lt;david@...&gt;  wrote:<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; My current feeling is that the best thing to do is to somehow allow<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; custom categories of test results.
