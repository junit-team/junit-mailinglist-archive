If you want to keep your test classes \n&gt;&gt;completely separate from the classes tested, then you&#39;ll only be testing \n&gt;&gt;the public interface (and you need to feel certain all your private \n&gt;&gt;methods work when they can only be tested indirectly via the public \n&gt;&gt;interface). If you want to test private methods directly, you must run \n&gt;&gt;your tests as inner classes.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; It is possible to rewrite the class files being tested at test-time to have\n&gt; all public methods.  Using Jakarta BCEL it wouldn&#39;t be that hard to due.\n&gt; Or you could run a special JVM that allows access to public methods.\n&gt; \n&gt; I do realize then you&#39;d be testing something other than the real code, but\n&gt; it&#39;s a way to get around the problem you mentioned.\n\nOr you could write your code in a language like Python that doesn&#39;t have \nprivate methods. :}\n\nSeriously, there may be other solutions (there are ALWAYS other \nsolutions!), but not necessarily rational, sensible ones - or a better \nway to say it would be that they don&#39;t meet the &quot;implicit requirements&quot;. \nI assume as a requirement that i am running in a JVM that conforms to \nJava specs - that excludes the custom JVM that ignores private. I don&#39;t \nfeel i need to explicitly state such a requirement! (Then again, on the \nother hand, there are often requirements which should be explicit rather \nthan implicit. I&#39;m starting to feel like a Talmudic scholar).  Another \nimplicit requirement is that the code i test be the same as the code i \nrun. Frankly, i have enough problems getting the *same* code to behave \nrepeatably in multiple environments! I don&#39;t want to deal with the code \nitself changing from what i tested.\n\nSuch abstract alternatives are far away from the original question, \nanyway. The problem at hand isn&#39;t even technical, but merely aesthetic - \nthe poster wants to be able to keep tests in a separate package for \naesthetic reasons, but wants to be able to test private methods from \noutside the package. That&#39;s not what private *is*!!! The very essence of \nthe private method is that nothing, NOTHING outside the original class \ncan access it (except for inner classes, a strange but clever hack that \nmakes the outside inside). There is no way to change JUnit in order to \naccomplish this impossibility - and no need for it, since JUnit classes \ncan be used as inner classes.\n\nConflict of technical versus technical is a problem that may or may not \nbe solvable. But conflict of technical versus aesthetic is a *smell*. \nThat smell says something is wrong - either not so much should be \nprivate, or the test harness needs to be more intimate with the code. In \nthis case, aesthetics are a luxury for programmers, much like morality \nis a luxury for politicians. Sometimes we need to cast aside aesthetics \nin order to do the job correctly. Ugly but right is always better than \npretty but wrong.\n\n-- \n\nDavid Stagner\n\nNational Marrow Donor Program\n3001 Broadway Street NE\nBroadway Ridge Suite 500\nMinneapolis, MN  55413\n\nEmail: dstagner@...\n\n\n\n",
