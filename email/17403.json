When you ship<br/>\nyour code, you certainly hope there is no bug in it.  I was just responding<br/>\nto the claim that &quot;if you don&#39;t TDD your code, you don&#39;t know that it works&quot;<br/>\nby saying that  &quot;there are plenty of ways to know that your code works, and<br/>\ntesting is only one of them&quot; (and an imperfect one at that, as somebody<br/>\npointed out earlier in this thread).<br/>\n<br/>\nTest cases are the only reliable indicator of code quality _and_ code<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; reliability, and because they are automated gives me far greater<br/>\n&gt; confidence in the integrity of the code I write.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Absolutely.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I&#39;m asked to review some code and tests, I will sit down and read the<br/>\ncode, and asking whether this code was tested using TDD will give me very<br/>\nlittle clue as to its quality.<br/>\n<br/>\nKent&#39;s argument has always worked for me - TDD when you can, think about<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; it when you can&#39;t.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Agreed.  I think that saying &quot;if you don&#39;t do TDD, you don&#39;t know that your<br/>\ncode works&quot; is preposterous.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn my opinion, it&#39;s not as important to &quot;test first&quot; as it is to &quot;test<br/>\nsoon&quot;, which sometimes means &quot;first&quot; and other times means &quot;when you think<br/>\nit&#39;s time&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nCédric<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://testng.org\">http://testng.org</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",
