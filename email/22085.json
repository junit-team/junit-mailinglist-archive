I don&#39;t have specific examples I can give<br/>\nyou just yet.<br/>\n<br/>\nI will give this some more thought, and maybe try some code. Before I went<br/>\nvery far I wanted to make sure there wasn&#39;t an existing system I should use.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for the responses. I have listened to the JUnit group for a while,<br/>\nbut this was my first post.<br/>\n<br/>\nLandon (AKA The Sunburned Surveyor)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Fri, Nov 20, 2009 at 11:22 AM, David Saff &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:david@...\">david@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Dear Sunburned,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; If I write<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; assertEquals(&quot;(1,-1,0)&quot;, point.toString());<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; and change the toString method, I get this (slightly garbled, but<br/>\n&gt; mostly helpful) failure:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; org.junit.ComparisonFailure: expected:&lt;[(1,-1,0)]&gt; but was:&lt;[[1, -1, 0]]&gt;<br/>\n&gt; at org.junit.Assert.assertEquals(Assert.java:123)...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; This seems to cover the one example you cite.

Please allow me to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; illustrate my question with a simple example.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;ve got a class called Coordinate that represents a point in a 3D<br/>\n&gt; &gt; coordinate system. I&#39;ve overloaded the toString method of this class<br/>\n&gt; &gt; to write out the X, Y, and Z values of the coordinate in a simple<br/>\n&gt; &gt; String. Now I want to test my toString method using JUnit.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; If the Coordinate.toString test method fails (because the string was<br/>\n&gt; &gt; not constructed in the correct format) I would like to provide the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; programmer running the test with a copy of the incorrect string, since<br/>\n&gt; &gt; it provides valuable clues about what is broken with the method under<br/>\n&gt; &gt; test. I typically do this by placing System.err.println statements in<br/>\n&gt; &gt; my test method. However, I realize that using System.err.println isn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the most portable or elegant way to provide this information to the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; programmer executing the test.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; What I really want is a GUI that allows the programmer to select a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; failed test from a list of failed tests, and then to view supplemental<br/>\n&gt; &gt; test data I provide him/her.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I was thinking I could do this by completing the following tasks:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; - Implementing the RunListener interface in JUnit.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; - Create an extension of Exception that could contain a HashMap of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; simple parameters and that would be passed to the constructor of a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Failure object from within a test.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; - Creating Failure objects in my tests that contain the supplemental<br/>\n&gt; &gt; failrure data.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; - Passing these failure objects to my RunListener implementaiton.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; - Creating a FailureProcessor class that displays a GUI with the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; information in my RunListener implemenation to show the programmer<br/>\n&gt; &gt; executing my tests the supplemental failure data as described above.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; (FailureProcessor would be an interface so that you could do different<br/>\n&gt; &gt; things with the supplemental failure data, not just show it in a GUI.)<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Before I begin this work, I wanted to ask if there was a better way to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; do this. I know I could use a logging framework from within my test<br/>\n&gt; &gt; method, but I really want to work within the JUnut framework, not<br/>\n&gt; &gt; outside of it. I also want a nice little GUI, not a log file.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; How are other programmers handling instances when they want to display<br/>\n&gt; &gt; supplemental data on failed tests? Does my approach sound reasonable?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; The Sunburned Surveyor<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Yahoo!
