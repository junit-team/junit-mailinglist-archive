You are asking a big question.  We are just\n&gt; treating EJB like any other classes.  We create the EJB in the set up method\n&gt; and then delete it in the tear down.  As long as you have the EJB deployed\n&gt; to a running app server, your off to the races.\n&gt; \n&gt; This is really a good topic for discussion.  Anyone else what to share there\n&gt; experiences with EJB testing?  I have heard allot about Cactus, How does it\n&gt; fit in to the whole thing?  (Now my post is the vague one &lt;grin&gt;)\n\nI think you should probably use both local and remote testing. It&#39;s probably\neasier to test a lot of the methods of the EJB by treating the bean\nimplentation as a local object, instantiated it and testing those methods.\nHowever, you also need to test the bean from the client&#39;s point of view. \n\nI think there are frameworks that run in the EJB server for testing the EJBs.\nBut it doesn&#39;t seem to be any more trouble just to create a client in the test\nclass. With the system I work on, I test my EJB by using the test class as\nclient that calls the business methods. That is, The test class contains a\nreference of the remote type, and then in the setup I get the context, do the\nlookup, and then create the reference to the remote object. Each test method\ncalls one business method, and I check the results of the method. There may be\nmultiple test methods for each business method. The teardown method calls the\nremove() method of the bean. These seems to work pretty well for my\nenvironment, but we only have about two dozen EJBs in our system.\n\n",
