Quality code only comes from<br/>\nusing TDD.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, TDD is not JUnit, after all, JUnit is just a library. TDD is at<br/>\nit&#39;s most basic, a philosophy. This means that anytime you are<br/>\ndeveloping with a positive feedback loop from your tests, you are<br/>\ndoing TDD.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, as I have already mentioned a few times in this thread, I have a<br/>\nfriend who works for a aeronautical testing company. They are called<br/>\nin to perform third-party independent verification of tests and test<br/>\nresults for flight systems. When flight systems are designed, their<br/>\ncomplete behaviour is specified up front. The code and the tests are<br/>\nwritten and then when all of the tests pass, the code is handed over<br/>\nto the third-party folks for verification.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can argue that this isn&#39;t TDD, and I wouldn&#39;t argue the point too<br/>\nhard, but the basic philosophy is compatible. They think carefully<br/>\nabout what they want, they define the desired behaviour including what<br/>\nthe tests should test and then the developers get to work and then<br/>\nthere is another round where the third-party verification provides<br/>\nfeedback on the tests and how well they satisfy the original<br/>\nrequirements. Hmmmm, that sounds like something I&#39;ve seen around here.<br/>\n:-)<br/>\n<br/>\nQuality is caring. <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://simonpeter.org/technology/writings/thirdlaw.html\">http://simonpeter.org/technology/writings/thirdlaw.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\nWithout caring, even someone who is mandated to use TDD is going to<br/>\nchurn out Sierra Hotel 1 Tango. I&#39;ve seen it done. At my previous<br/>\nemployer, unit tests were mandated, so some developers created unit<br/>\ntests but never made any assertions about expected results. Naturally<br/>\nthe tests passed, because they never actually tested anything and<br/>\ntherefore could never fail.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile I&#39;m fully in favour of TDD, without caring, TDD cannot work.<br/>\nWithout caring, non-TDD development techniques can&#39;t work either.<br/>\nWithout caring, even the aeronautical testing won&#39;t work.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you do care about quality, I assert (pun intended) that TDD is the<br/>\nmost effective converter of caring into software quality.<br/>\n<br/>\nSimon<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nwww.simonpeter.org<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On 8/11/06, Brett L.

This says nothing good about our industry or our users, I<br/>\n&gt; fear.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I just can&#39;t buy the notion that it&#39;s possible to write good, untested<br/>\n&gt; &gt; code. Show it to me. Where is this good, untested code?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I still maintain that it&#39;s all about quality. TDD is a tool to help<br/>\n&gt; you build quality in to your software. It isn&#39;t, nor should it be a<br/>\n&gt; religion. I&#39;m sure it&#39;s possible to write code that is &quot;good enough&quot;<br/>\n&gt; without TDD, but it&#39;ll never be high quality.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; And you&#39;ll never get code that&#39;s &quot;good enough&quot; accepted into flight<br/>\n&gt; systems. They not only test the code, but they have independent<br/>\n&gt; testers test the tests and certify the results. When Windows crashes<br/>\n&gt; it&#39;s annoying, when airplanes crash, it&#39;s at the far end of bad.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; It&#39;s all about how much quality you want in your code. Quality has to<br/>\n&gt; be built in, you can&#39;t go back an bolt it on. I use TDD whenever<br/>\n&gt; possible to build quality into my code. No one make me do it, but I<br/>\n&gt; find that the more tests I write, the quicker I write them and the<br/>\n&gt; quicker I get to working code.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Simon<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --<br/>\n&gt; www.simonpeter. org<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>",
