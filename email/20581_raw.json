You&#39;ve never met Phil nor have you\n&gt; seen any of his test cases. You&#39;ve no idea if he writes small focused\n&gt; tests or not.\n&gt;\n&gt; I think we can all learn to do a better job but I don&#39;t think this\n&gt; sort of reply serves either Phil or you well. Perhaps if this\n&gt; discussion were face to face that would have helped us all.\n\nHaving been on both sides of the debating table with JB, both agreeing\nwith and disagreeing with, I would just like to say that JB has always\nbeen one to conduct himself with the highest level of manners and\nintegrity, both on this list and in other venues.\n\nJB&#39;s specific question that appears to have triggered your concern\nlooks perfectly reasonable to me.\n\nPlease accept my apologies, but I had not been closely following this\nconversation because logging within unit tests seems unnecessary. I\nget a report when I run the tests using Ant, and as long as they all\npass, and have been updated as necessary, it shouldn&#39;t matter. But as\na moderator on this list, your comment caught my eye when approving\nit.\n\nPart of the challenge of email communication is that we get none of\nthe spontaneity of face to face discussions and none of the\nside-channel meta-communications (gestures, facial expressions,\nlaughter etc etc), so please take extra care to allow for this known\ndrawback. I have never had the opportunity to meet JB in person, but\nhe and I have managed to have some excellent conversations over the\nyears both where I agreed and dis-agreed. One disagreement was so\nstrong, that he quoted me in his book as the opposite side for one of\nhis essays in the appendixes. Seems more than fair to me! :-)\n\nSimon\n(One of the JUnit list moderators)\n\n-- \nsimonpeter.org | simonpeter.com | newlife-upc.org | wisconsindistrictnews.org\n\n",
