Remember that the point of JUnit is not to<br/>\n&gt; functionally test the software. It is to unit test it. Try to break down<br/>\n&gt; your code into small testable pieces. By testing each piece you will<br/>\n&gt; have<br/>\n&gt; greater control and more confidence that it will work once you put it<br/>\n&gt; together. It may not even be necessary to run the client and server at<br/>\n&gt; the<br/>\n&gt; same time if you take this approach; the test case could act as the<br/>\n&gt; server<br/>\n&gt; for testing the client and vice-versa. These are just a few thoughts --<br/>\n&gt; the<br/>\n&gt; details of your particular program may prevent such an approach. But if<br/>\n&gt; you<br/>\n&gt; are testing your code from the very beginning you shouldn&#39;t have too<br/>\n&gt; much<br/>\n&gt; trouble doing it.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Chris<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: guillaume_berche [mailto:guillaume.berche@e...]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Monday, January 21, 2002 8:49 AM<br/>\n&gt; To: junit@y...<br/>\n&gt; Subject: [junit] Junit support for non-standard distributed applications<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Hello,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m working on a Java layer implementing various communication <br/>\n&gt; infrastructrure betwen processes based on raw TCP and UDP.

I&#39;m basically remotizing the <br/>\n&gt; junit interfaces.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I wonder if such extension would already exist and if I could reuse <br/>\n&gt; it rather than redoing this from scratch. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Thanks for your help,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Guillaume. </span></blockquote></div>",
