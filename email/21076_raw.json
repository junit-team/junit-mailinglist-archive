Let us say that I had test classes, Test0, Test1. Each of these \nrequires a backend to be configured. I&#39;d like to do something like this:\n\n@RunWith(Suite.class)\n@...({Test0.class, Test1.class})\npublic abstract class MySuite{\n  abstract public void  setBackend(Backend backend);\n\n @BeforeClass\n  public static void doSetup() throws Exception{\n    //... stuff to get this all pulled together and configure the tests\n  }\n}\n\nThen all a tester needs to do is extend the class MySuite, implement the \nmethod and s/he gets to run their backend against my tests.\n\nComplicating factors are that java does not allow for annotations to be \ninherited unless the @interface is created with the @Inherited \nannotation, so attempts to do what is above kick back the message that \nthere are no tests to run or some such. At least this is my \nunderstanding of java annotations...\n\nThe real life example has not just a couple of test classes, but many \nmore that very rigorously exercise the backend. The kludge is to have \nthe abstract MySuite class and have the annotations cut and pasted every \ntime. This is bad since it will make maintainability problematic (we \nhave lots of different backend configurations people want to test \nagainst). What&#39;s more several people who want to use this really don&#39;t \nknow that much about jUnit and we&#39;d really like it to be the case they \ncan write a backend then get good feedback on robustness, failure modes, \nyou name it.\n\nIs this clearer?\n\nThanks in Advance!\n\nJeff\n\nDavid Saff wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Jeff,\n&gt;\n&gt; Can you expand on what you mean by &quot;The problem is that making a suite\n&gt; using annotations does not really work so well. The annotations are\n&gt; not inherited.&quot;? Can you give an example of what you&#39;d like to do?\n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt;\n&gt; David Saff\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt; On Mon, Nov 3, 2008 at 2:54 PM, Jeff &lt;jjg@... \n&gt; &lt;mailto:jjg%40jqhome.net&gt;&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Hi,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I am new to this group, so if there is a FAQ or thread that addresses\n&gt; &gt; this, please direct me appropriately.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I wrote a comprehensive set of tests in jUnit that run under Maven. Now,\n&gt; &gt; these run against a single backend and now several developers in my\n&gt; &gt; group would like to use these tests against other backends to test them.\n&gt; &gt; The most natural way to do this is with the test suite mechanism in\n&gt; &gt; jUnit. That is to say, make up a suite that requires merely that the\n&gt; &gt; backend be set and test away. Or so I thought.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The different backends are different projects in our group and live in\n&gt; &gt; different Maven modules.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The problem is that making a suite using annotations does not really\n&gt; &gt; work so well. The annotations are not inherited. The other solution\n&gt; &gt; which is to have the developers make their own suites by annotations is\n&gt; &gt; also very clunky and will probably break at some point.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; So here is my question: Is there any way to make a test suite that is a\n&gt; &gt; harness and can be reused?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I assume that jUnit 3.8&#39;s method of explicitly creating a suite is going\n&gt; &gt; to get deprecated soon, right? So that would be a deadend. Also, are\n&gt; &gt; their plans to make annotations inheritable at some point in jUnit? We\n&gt; &gt; could maybe live with cutting and pasting for the short term if we knew\n&gt; &gt; that this issue would get resolved at some point.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Thanks!\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Jeff\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n\n\n",
