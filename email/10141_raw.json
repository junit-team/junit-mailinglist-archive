Discovered\n&gt; DBUnit, but I&#39;m not sure how I should approach my problem.\n&gt;\n&gt; We migrate a database from one data schema to another, completely\n&gt; different. I want to be sure data is migrated correctly (so that for\n&gt; example a customer keeps its orders).\n&gt;\n&gt; My first idea was to iterate on customers in the source database, and\n&gt; check its data against the new database.\n&gt; For example, for a customer, I would have tests on, amongst others:\n&gt; -contacts\n&gt; -orders\n&gt; -address\n&gt; and each test would be run for each row coming from the source database.\n&gt;\n&gt; Is that the correct approach?\n&gt; From what I discovered of JUnit, I&#39;m not sure how to integrate the\n&gt; iteration in the test suite ( The same test would be run against all rows\n&gt; from the database).\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks in advance for your help. I hope I didn&#39;t miss any obvious thing\n&gt; before posting this....\n&gt;\n&gt; Raph\n\nRaph,\n\nThis sounds like a fine approach.  Why not try it in a small fashion and \nsee if it would meet your needs?  As far as the implementation is \nconcerned... I would hope that you already have something of a persistence \nabstraction layer in which you could swap out the DBs.  The first thing I \nmight do is to build up models on one DB, swap in the new DB, build models \nagain and compare them.  Make sense?\n\n=jason\n\n-- \nUsing M2, Opera&#39;s revolutionary e-mail client: http://www.opera.com/m2/\n\n",
