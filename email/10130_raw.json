If you have general \nquestions about a topic, then go to http://www.google.com, enter a few \nkeywords, press the big Search button and look through a few relavent \nlinks. Download tutorials and software, install, and try things out.\n\nWhen you have tried a few things out and have some specific questions, \nsuch as &quot;why doesn&#39;t this work?&quot; or &quot;what am I doing wrong here?&quot;, then \npost them here to the mailing list, where I&#39;m sure that /someone/ (and \npossibly me, depending on whether I have time at that moment) will answer.\n\nIf you are looking to hire a consultant to help your company adopt JUnit \nand testing-oriented practices, then by all means, please visit the \nDiaspar Software web site, the URL for which is in every message I \nwrite. If you are looking for free help, then go to the mailing lists, \nand not directly to me.\n\nThank you for your time.\n-- \nJ. B. Rainsberger,\nDiaspar Software Services\nhttp://www.diasparsoftware.com :: +1 416 791-8603\nLet&#39;s write software that people understand\n\n\n",
