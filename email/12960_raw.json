I have been able to seperate most\n&gt; functional code from the\n&gt; EJB code and am able to unit test most of the code.\n&gt; However, some of\n&gt; my tests still throw errors simply because i am\n&gt; running these tests\n&gt; outside of the weblogic&#39;s JVM. Is there a way to get\n&gt; into a running\n&gt; JVM (weblogic in my case) and load junit classes and\n&gt; my classes in\n&gt; that container&#39;s JVM?\n\nI think this might be what you&#39;re looking for:\nhttp://www.junitee.org/\n\nI just started looking at it myself and got distracted\nwith other things, so I can&#39;t claim to have experience\nusing it.  Looks like it is pretty useful for this\nkind of thing though.\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nTired of spam?  Yahoo!
