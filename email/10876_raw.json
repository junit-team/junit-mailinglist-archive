This is where a work around could work.  However, I have \nanother issue.  I&#39;ve never been very good with regular expressions, \nwhich seems to be the best way to either search and replace or search \nand add.  If I have a project class and I want to add a name, what \nwould I do?  Here&#39;s a vague example of what I&#39;m trying to do:\n\n&lt;testsuite ... name=&quot;[package name].class&quot; ...&gt; changed to:\n&lt;testsuite ... name=&quot;[package name].class.[test name]&quot; ...&gt;\n\nBecause the package name (or similarly class name) is the same for \nevery test, the test was overwritten.  However, each test I run has \nit&#39;s own name, which I could add at the end as described above.  The \nonly bad part is that the report then recognizes the &quot;[package \nname].class&quot; as the package, instead of just the package and the \ntest &quot;[test name]&quot; as the class instead of the actual class.  This is \nmore of an annoyance, however, not an actual problem.\n\nIf someone has any pointers on good ways to use reg ex or another \nmethod, I&#39;d appreciate it.  I hope to be able to do this for multiple \nfiles, so I&#39;m looking for a more script-like implementation.  I \nunderstand I could use &quot;sed&quot; in Unix, but again, I am not very good \nwith regular expressions.  Thanks!\n\n\n\n\n--- In junit@yahoogroups.com, &quot;J. B. Rainsberger&quot; &lt;jbrains@r...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt; junit_rinaldi wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; In general, the output shows that there were a certain number of\n&gt; &gt; tests, but because the same class is used, the &lt;class&gt;.html file \nis\n&gt; &gt; overwritten along with other helpful output information.  This \nleaves\n&gt; &gt; only the output for the last test run.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; If anyone knows a good method for getting around this JUnit\n&gt; &gt; limitation, please let me know!!!\n&gt; \n&gt; Play around with test suite and test case /names/, since I believe \n&gt; /those/ are used to generate report files, and not class names. The \n&gt; coincidence is that, by default, test suites and test cases are \nnamed \n&gt; after their respective class/method names. You can always change \nthe \n&gt; name of a test suite, although at present I only know of one way to \ndo it:\n&gt; \n&gt; suite = new TestSuite(&quot;My Custom-Named Test Suite&quot;);\n&gt; \n&gt; I suggest looking at how to change the /names/ of the various Test \n&gt; objects (suites and cases) to get the desired result.\n&gt; \n&gt; Good luck.\n&gt; -- \n&gt; J.
