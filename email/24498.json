To clear up my point, I wasn&#39;t saying that there wasn&#39;t a way to to compare BigDecimals, I was saying that there isn&#39;t a way to do it that ships with Junit. There are hamcrest Matchers that ship with JUnit, and there are hamcrest Matchers that handle BigDecimal comparisons well, but none of those ship with JUnit.</p>\n\n</div></div></div></div></blockquote><div><br></div><div><span style=\"font-family:arial, sans-serif;font-size:12.800000190734863px;\">JUnit depends on Hamcrest, and there are a even some JUnit APIs that accept Hamcrest matcher (like ExpectedException).

Luckily, there are</span><span style=\"font-family:arial, sans-serif;\"> many really good, supported, open-source Java assertion frameworks (including Hamcrest, Fest, Truth) that filled in that void.</span></div>\n\n<div><br></div><div><font face=\"arial, sans-serif\">When we had trouble coming up with a set of good Comparable assertion APIs, and realized that Hamcrest (which JUnit itself integrates with) had a good set of Comparable assertion APIs, we decided to not add APIs to JUnit. Maybe that was the wrong decision, but it seemed like a reasonable one at the time.</font></div>\n\n<div><font face=\"arial, sans-serif\"><br></font></div><div><font face=\"arial, sans-serif\">Perhaps you can come up with a good, simple API to do this. Or perhaps we were trying to solve the wrong problem, and there&#39;s a simpler API that meets 90% of your use cases.  Either way, if you have a good idea, please feel free to send us a pull request.</font></div>\n\n<div><font face=\"arial, sans-serif\"><br></font></div><div><font face=\"arial, sans-serif\">Most of the changes to JUnit don&#39;t come from those of us who help maintain JUnit@GitHub; they come from users like you.

Are you suggesting that JUnit should include it&#39;s own Hamcrest Matcher that works with BigDecimal? That we should provide our own assertion DSL? Or that we should simply have an API that can assert that two BigDecimal values are the same?</div>\n\n<div><br></div><div>-- Kevin</div><div><br></div></div></span></blockquote></div></div>\n</div>",
