Do \nyou think this is no longer a unit test when I start making sure that \nthe messenger is respondeing correctly when something is added?  \n\nShould the unit test only make sure that the addMessage() method is \nworking (I.e. it received the message), and the integration test \nshould then make sure that when a certain message is added it \nrecieves the correct response message via the listener?\n\nThanks\n\n--- In junit@y..., &quot;Michael Rettig&quot; &lt;mrettig@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; ----- Original Message -----\n&gt; From: Mike Clark &lt;mike@c...&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;I have already implemented this with JUnit by making the \n&gt; &gt; &gt;TestMessenger TestCase a MessengerLister.  After I add a message \nI \n&gt; &gt; &gt;sleep until a response is supplied. I then wake up (or time out \nfor \n&gt; &gt; &gt;failure) and test if this is the correct response to assert if \nthe \n&gt; &gt; &gt;test failed or passed. \n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Sounds like a reasonable integration test.  That&#39;s generally the \n&gt; &gt; approach I take when faced with testing asynchronous messaging \nend-to-end.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Mike\n&gt; \n&gt; Also, you can look at mocking your messenger layer. Whenever, I&#39;ve \ndone asynch testing, I found a way to make the testing synchronouse \nusing a mock layer. This was ideal for simulating odd messaging \nbehavior that could not be easily replicated asynchronously.  \n&gt; \n&gt; Mike Rettig\n&gt; -- \n&gt; __________________________________________________________\n&gt; Sign-up for your own FREE Personalized E-mail at Mail.com\n&gt; http://www.mail.com/?sr=signup\n&gt; \n&gt; Single & ready to mingle? lavalife.com:  Where singles click.
