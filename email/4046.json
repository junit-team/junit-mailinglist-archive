Then use <br/>\n  assertTrue(&quot;...&quot;,myFunction(obj,xml)) <br/>\nin your tests.  <br/>\nThis way your custom test code is still enclosed in the test class (or<br/>\nat least in the same package) and you don&#39;t have to override anything in<br/>\nthe testing framework.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you were comparing two objects of the same class, I would recomend<br/>\njust putting the comparison code in the .equals() method, but it sounds<br/>\nlike you are comparing an object to an XML fragment.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Tue, 2002-02-12 at 20:31, pisharath_k wrote:<br/>\n    I have a basic question.

I will pass it the object to compare, and it will compare <br/>\n    the object&#39;s data against pre-defined values that will be stored in <br/>\n    the helper classes. I will need to extend junit&#39;s Assert class for <br/>\n    these helper class, since they will assert if there is a data <br/>\n    mismatch. So my question is,  is it okay to extend Assert in my own <br/>\n    classes ? Has anyone faced this problem before, and if so how did you <br/>\n    solve this ?
