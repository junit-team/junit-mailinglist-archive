If you do then you have pay the price\nof the transition eventually. I had a similiar class of problem\ntransitioning from NUnit 1.??? to 2.0 on a .NET project a few years ago. In\nthe end two of us divvied up the test code base and tore it too pieces with\nscripts and chainsaws over two days. We reviewed each others work and got it\nright without too too much trouble.\n\nAs for JUnit 4.x vs 3.8 - I&#39;ve never had the problems you outlined perhaps\nwe should all dig deeper.\n\nBack to my paying client. Thanks for the fun.\nMark\n\nOn Tue, Feb 17, 2009 at 4:46 PM, yme0987654321 &lt;yme0987654321@...&gt;wrote:\n\n&gt;   I looked at it, and found it to be rather error prone, in that you\n&gt; have to get every setup method as a before, and every teardown as an\n&gt; after, change the constructor, etc. I didn&#39;t find a tool to do it.\n&gt;\n&gt; The only problems I have with the hack code I presented are:\n&gt;\n&gt; 1) it is extremely brittle. I expect it to break with JUnit 4.6.\n&gt; 2) Intellij doesn&#39;t report the test name correctly. It reports:\n&gt;\n&gt; Test &#39;com.intellij.rt.junit4.Junit4ClassSuite$1.0 test case(s)&#39; ignored.\n&gt;\n&gt; I assume it looks at the annotation and does its own naming.\n&gt;\n&gt; The main reason I&#39;m asking on the group is in case I&#39;m missing\n&gt; something about the approach, and perhaps the JUnit developers had\n&gt; something else in mind. Clearly they do for JUnit 4 tests, but I\n&gt; haven&#39;t found anything for intermixing JUnit 3 tests.\n&gt;\n&gt; I do appreciate the insight about the Assume class, it is very helpful\n&gt; to know!\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In junit@yahoogroups.com &lt;junit%40yahoogroups.com&gt;, Mark Levison\n&gt; &lt;mark@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; On Tue, Feb 17, 2009 at 1:23 PM, yme0987654321 &lt;yme0987654321@...&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Hi David,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; My name is Yishai (I have to figure out how to change this Yahoo\n&gt; &gt; &gt; profile). Anyway, I guess the issue is that I have many tests that are\n&gt; &gt; &gt; in the 3.8 style that I am retrofitting, so to use this I would have\n&gt; &gt; &gt; to change the test into a Junit 4 type test, whereas in my hack the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; runner correctly figured out that it was a JUnit 3.8 style test.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Have you considered converting the tests to Junit 4? I&#39;m sure if you\n&gt; &gt; ask around some has implemented a script to get most of the monkey\n&gt; &gt; work done.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Cheers\n&gt; &gt; Mark\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Blog: http://www.notesfromatooluser.com/\n&gt; &gt; Recent Entries: Agile/Scrum Smells:\n&gt; &gt; http://www.notesfromatooluser.com/2008/06/agilescrum-smells.html\n&gt; &gt; Agile Games for Making Retrospectives Interesting:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; http://www.notesfromatooluser.com/2008/10/agile-games-for-making-retrospectives-interesting.html\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\n\n\n-- \nCheers\nMark Levison\nBlog: http://www.notesfromatooluser.com/\nRecent Entries: Agile/Scrum Smells:\nhttp://www.notesfromatooluser.com/2008/06/agilescrum-smells.html\nAgile Games for Making Retrospectives Interesting:\nhttp://www.notesfromatooluser.com/2008/10/agile-games-for-making-retrospectives-interesting.html\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n",
