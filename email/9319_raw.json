And after that the test, i&#39;ll also \nneed to clear the data. This works, but i find that quite \ntroublesome. Can DBUnit provides an easier alternative to what i am \ndoing? Or is there any other easier way?\n\nIs DBUnit tied to any database, Oracle, MySQL, etc?\n\nThanks lots.\n\nVeny\n\n\n\n",
