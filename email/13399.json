Each state transition is<br/>\ndone by send a message. Now at each stage i have a set of testcases to<br/>\nrun. one example testcase could be i send a join room message when i<br/>\nam not logged in, but befor i run this test case i need to be<br/>\nconnected to the server, which becomes a fixture. So basicaly each<br/>\nstate i mentioned above becomes a fixture which display a parent child<br/>\nrelationship, ie i cannot be logged in unless i am already connected.<br/>\nI need to be able to pass the socket connection across fixtures and<br/>\nfrom the final fixture to the required testcase.<br/>\nThe approach i was going with was to use JSystem for the fixture<br/>\nhierarchy implementation (which i can really use here) and have a<br/>\nstatic helper to pass the connection around.<br/>\nAny thoughts or suggestions are welcome.<br/>\n<br/>\nAkhil Srinivasan<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On 5/3/05, Arun J &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mail.jak@...\">mail.jak@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;  Soln 1:Use Cactus which provides Servlet/JSP type test interface.

One mechanism i thought of was<br/>\n&gt;  &gt;  extending a testcase that will contain the connection and use it as a<br/>\n&gt;  &gt;  fixture, all testcases will call that as a fixture but how do i shared<br/>\n&gt;  &gt;  the connection from the fixture to other testcases which them selves<br/>\n&gt;  &gt;  need to send messages?<br/>\n&gt;  &gt;  Thanks<br/>\n&gt;  &gt;  Akhil Srinivasan<br/>\n&gt;  &gt;<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;  ________________________________<br/>\n&gt;  Yahoo!
