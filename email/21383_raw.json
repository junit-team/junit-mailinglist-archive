Selenium seems to be\n=\r\nnice, since it allows someone without much (or none at all)\nprogramming exp=\r\nerience, as our Product Owner to create those tests\nwith Firefox Selenium I=\r\nDE plug-in.\n\nBut time has come to integrate those tests to other JUnit test=\r\ns, so\nthese can be run on CI server.\n\nIs there any know-how or link which c=\r\nould help. I already visited\nmavenium (http://mavenium.sourceforge.net/inde=\r\nx.html) and\nmaven2-selenium plug-in\nsite(http://mojo.codehaus.org/selenium-=\r\nmaven-plugin/index.html), but\ndocumentation is not quite clear, or at least=\r\n I couldn&#39;t run my tests.\n\nAs I understood, selenium-rc should run automati=\r\ncally if defined in\npom.xml and then Selenium JUnit tests should run fine. =\r\nWhat about\njetty? Is it run implicitly, or some server should be run? If no=\r\nt\nautomatically, should it be run manually? In this case CI doesn&#39;t make\nse=\r\nnse, since you have to deploy application to some other server.\n\nHuh...too =\r\nmany questions, I guess. I would be happy to have at least\nsome answers.\n\nR=\r\negards,\nMarko\n\n\n",
