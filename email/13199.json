It takes an input file executes all the <br/>\nattribute values and throws an exception if there is an error. There <br/>\nare about 150+ of these files. To fix it up I wrapped it in Junit. Now <br/>\neach executed file is treated as an individual test. This works great, <br/>\nI have a nice gui telling me which testfiles passed and which failed. <br/>\nThe problem is that it doesnt tell me why they fail. the original <br/>\nprogram still throws an exception but Junit cannot hear it. Is there <br/>\nany way of directing the error to Junit? thanks Jonno</div>",
