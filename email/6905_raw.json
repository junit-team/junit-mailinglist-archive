Surely there is some of that but my \n&gt; perception is much\n&gt; &gt; more that once one test is done, the next becomes obvious.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; It&#39;s possible that I have more of a list in my head than I&#39;m\n&gt; &gt; aware of. It&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; also possible that with a century of experience and a \n&gt; highly intuitive and\n&gt; &gt; interrupt-driven style of thinking, things just &quot;come&quot; to \n&gt; me. Still, I\n&gt; &gt; perceive nothing very &quot;scratchpad&quot; about the way I think, \n&gt; and I use no\n&gt; &gt; physical forward-looking list at all.\n&gt; \n&gt; That aligns with my experience - I typically have some rough \n&gt; ideas about\n&gt; what I probably will need to test, but I don&#39;t write them \n&gt; down. It&#39;s mainly\n&gt; the state of the production code which motivates my next test, not a\n&gt; predetermined list.\n&gt; \n&gt; I have the suspicion that this is very individual; there is a \n&gt; programmer I\n&gt; much like to pair with because of her very different way of thinking -\n&gt; possibly having a test list written down could smooth pairing \n&gt; sessions here.\n&gt; \n&gt; Regards, Ilja\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; testdrivendevelopment-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
