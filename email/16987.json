I needed<br/>\nto write some tests around a user belonging to a group.<br/>\n <br/>\nI needed at a minimum an implementation of IDfUser and IDfGroup. Due to the<br/>\nnature of the beast it is most common to get these from the session<br/>\n(IDfSession). As all of these are interfaces it wasn&#39;t too bad but each of<br/>\nthe interfaces extends others and have several hundred methods each. I<br/>\neventually decided that what I was trying to test in this case was<br/>\nDocumentum logic and that I should just trust the framework.<br/>\n <br/>\nAnother example is Documentum web components which are similiar in some ways<br/>\nto JSF. These extend standard Documentum classes which provide a large<br/>\namount of functionality much of which eventually ties back to a functionaing<br/>\nsql database via a custom interface and/or query language. In these cases<br/>\nthe best I could do was to test extracted business logic piecemeal.<br/>\n <br/>\nMichael Rutherfurd<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a>] On Behalf Of<br/>\nDavid Saff<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, 21 June 2006 12:05 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Mocking libraries and moving parts (was: Re: [junit] unit test case<br/>\nfor login())<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nRutherford, Michael wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I&#39;ve looked in passing at the various mocking libraries<br/>\n&gt; and they looked interesting but again required too many &quot;moving parts&quot; to<br/>\n </span></blockquote>be<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; useful for more than trivial tests.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Can you elaborate on this? I&#39;ve used mocking libraries on some rather <br/>\nnon-trivial tests, but I&#39;m willing to believe there are special features <br/>\nin Documentum&#39;s API that make it hard. I&#39;m curious what those features <br/>\nare.
