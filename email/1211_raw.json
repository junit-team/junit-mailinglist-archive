Could I help you in any way?\n&gt; \n&gt; You can poke me every so often so I don&#39;t procrastinate. :) \nActually, I&#39;ve\n&gt; collected a lot of material in the last few weeks, and I just need \nto polish\n&gt; it up a bit. I&#39;m not aiming at formal publication or anything... \njust an\n&gt; article on junit.org would be the limits of my humble ambition.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Could you please submit a simple example of a the &quot;smart&quot; function\n&gt; &gt; (method :-) you talked about.\n&gt; \n&gt; Um. Okay.\n&gt; \n&gt; Here&#39;s a sample test method:\n&gt;     public void testGetMerchantId() throws java.rmi.RemoteException \n{\n&gt;         obtainMerchant(&quot;Merchant1&quot;);\n&gt;         assertEquals(&quot;Merchant1&quot;, getSample().getMerchantId());\n&gt;     }\n&gt; \n&gt; Here&#39;s a smart implementation of obtainMerchant:\n&gt;     protected void obtainMerchant(String merchantId) {\n&gt;       if (EjbHelper.isLive()) {\n&gt;           try {\n&gt;               javax.ejb.EJBHome ejbHome =\n&gt; EjbHelper.lookupHome(MERCHANT_HOME, MerchantHome.class);\n&gt;               MerchantHome home = (MerchantHome)ejbHome;\n&gt;               \n&gt;               setSample(home.create(merchantId));\n&gt;           }\n&gt;           catch (javax.ejb.CreateException e) {\n&gt;               throw new RuntimeException(&quot;CreateException: &quot; +\n&gt; e.getMessage());\n&gt;           }\n&gt;           catch (javax.naming.NamingException e) {\n&gt;               throw new RuntimeException(&quot;NamingException: &quot; +\n&gt; e.getMessage());\n&gt;           }\n&gt;           catch (java.rmi.RemoteException e) {\n&gt;               throw new RuntimeException(&quot;RemoteException: &quot; +\n&gt; e.getMessage());\n&gt;           }\n&gt;       }\n&gt;       else {\n&gt;         return new MerchantImpl(merchantId);\n&gt;       }\n&gt;     }\n&gt; \n&gt; (EjbHelper is a utility class, but it should be fairly obvious what \nit does,\n&gt; from context). About the only thing that&#39;s not clear is that\n&gt; EjbHelper.isLive() returns Boolean.getBoolean(&quot;EJB_LIVE_MODE&quot;), \nallowing EJB\n&gt; testing to be turned on or off by supplying a system property.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Any other tips and practical issues regarding testing and EJB \nwould\n&gt; &gt; be great.\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;ll see what I can come up with.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; I have heard that this (testing locally and then live) is not\n&gt; &gt; nessesary with Visual Age since you can run your appserver within\n&gt; &gt; Visual Age...? Is this true?\n&gt; \n&gt; Technically, this is true, or so I&#39;m told. When I was playing with \nEJB 1.0,\n&gt; I didn&#39;t have Visual Age. When I had Visual Age, I&#39;d moved on to \nEJB 1.1,\n&gt; which VAJ doesn&#39;t support. However, I&#39;ve got a goal of being able \nto run my\n&gt; unit tests from the command line, via Ant, so I wouldn&#39;t want to \nrely on\n&gt; such support, anyway (though it would be handy for the odd debugging\n&gt; session).\n&gt; \n&gt; However, VAJ doesn&#39;t like more than one person working on an EJB \ngroup (a\n&gt; collection of related EJBs) at a time (it will actually end up \ncorrupting\n&gt; the repository, given enough time, and will produce all sorts of \nweird side\n&gt; effects in the interim). If you&#39;re working by yourself, that&#39;s not a\n&gt; problem. If you&#39;re working with others, it&#39;s nasty. There&#39;s a \nreview on\n&gt; theserverside.com, by Bartek Kiepuszewski (a former co-worker of \nmine),\n&gt; which details all the hassles we had doing EJB development in VAJ \nand\n&gt; WebSphere.
