Normally I&#39;d say yes - you don&#39;t want cycles in an \n&gt; object graph. In this case I&#39;m not so sure it&#39;s a problem, because \n&gt; it might just be my own private definition of what clean code looks \n&gt; like and Java seems more forgiving than C++ wrt cycles. [...]\n\nI&#39;m sorry, but I didn&#39;t follow your explanation -- I&#39;m still\nconfused about why dependency cycles among objects are a bad\nthing.  (Perhaps I missed the reason clearly stated in the snipped\ntext, in which case I hope you will patiently explain it again.)\n\nHere&#39;s a silly example of what I think we&#39;re talking about, for\nconcreteness.\n\n\t// a list\n\tclass FooList {\n\t\t// the nodes which comprise this list\n\t\tFooNode[] nodes;\n\t\t// ...\n\t}\n\n\t// an element of a list\n\tclass FooNode {\n\t\t// the list of which this node is a member\n\t\tFooList list;\n\t\t// ...\n\t}\n\nHere, as you see, FooList refers to FooNode and vice versa.\n\nNow, what specifically might I want to do with the code above that\nis more difficult because of this circularity?  The only thing I\ncan think of is incremental compilation, which is certainly tricky.\n\n&gt; [...] And I&#39;m\n&gt; pretty sure Gamma and Beck and the legion of developers that use and \n&gt; extend JUnit know about dependency cycles. [...]\n\nAs I&#39;m sure the above makes clear, I don&#39;t know much of interest\nabout them.\n\n-- \nSteven Taschuk           |   7&#92; 7&#39;Z {&~         .
