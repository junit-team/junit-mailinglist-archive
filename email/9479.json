The bad advice was the<br/>\n&gt; _categorical_ statement that comments are waste.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>OK, I see.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; On the other hand, if the code embodies application-specific<br/>\n&gt; knowledge, it is usually important and often essential to explain.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yes, of course. Most often that knowledge can be explained by using<br/>\ncode, though.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Walter was well known for his incredibly precise, tight code.  It was<br/>\n&gt; beautiful. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; He was also very economical with comments.  That wasn&#39;t so<br/>\n&gt; wonderful for those who had to decrypt the code when he wasn&#39;t there.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Perhaps &quot;precise, tight&quot; code isn&#39;t exactly the same as &quot;expressive,<br/>\nmaintainable&quot; code? I&#39;d really like to see some code snippets the<br/>\nmaintaines had problems with...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; Saying &quot;write your code in a way that it doesn&#39;t need comments&quot; is<br/>\n&gt;&gt; very good advice, on the other hand.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; That I would agree with.  Although some of us do like Javadocs.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I have never seen a javadoc comment I would have preferred over code. If<br/>\nyou can&#39;t have the code, Javadoc is very nice, though.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;                                 And in my experience you *can* learn<br/>\n&gt;&gt; to write code in a way that you very seldom need to fall back on this<br/>\n&gt;&gt; crutch.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Crutch?  Name-calling helps no one.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Sorry, I didn&#39;t mean it that way. A crutch is an important tool to me.<br/>\nThere are situations where I definitely want to have one. Most often I<br/>\nwant to avoid to need one, though. Exactly the same with comments. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Can we return to JUnit and the thrill of unit testing?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t mind.<br/>\n<br/>\nTake care, Ilja</div>",
