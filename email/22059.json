By clock, not by resources.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the classes I&#39;m testing is a working set cache, and in order to<br/>\ntest it, you have to wait until a cycle or two have gone by to let the<br/>\nmark logic work.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis takes a long time, during which the main JUnit test is just doing a<br/>\nThread.sleep(bignumber);<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I&#39;d love to do is start the cache testing code, and then continue<br/>\nwith other tests that are not time dependant while the cache test is<br/>\ndoing the big sleep();<br/>\n<br/>\nIt would not be hard to use Java&#39;s concurancy tests to resync things,<br/>\nbut I don&#39;t have any idea if, or how, to get subsequent tests to fire off.<br/>\n<br/>\nIs this possible?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks<br/>\nPat<br/>\n-- <br/>\nPat Farrell<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.pfarrell.com/\">http://www.pfarrell.com/</a></div>",
