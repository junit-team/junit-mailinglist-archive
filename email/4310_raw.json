Upon running its 200\n&gt; some odd tests, it creates a report of the results of the tests.  OK,\n&gt; sounds like something JUnit might be able to handle.  However, the\n&gt; basic test that I want to to compare the output file with the\n&gt; expected result file.  If the files do differ, then I&#39;d like a\n&gt; listing of ALL the places where they differ.  Is there anything in\n&gt; JUnit or any of its extensions that does something like this?  I know\n&gt; this is not really unit testing, more like black box application\n&gt; testing, but I like the formatting and gui options of JUnit and would\n&gt; like to be able to use it if possible.\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks in advance,\n&gt; Adam\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
