One possibility is to use the TemporaryFolder rule<br/>\n&gt; in JUnit 4.7 and above. This creates a new temporary folder for each<br/>\n&gt; test, and deletes it afterward. Since each test automatically gets a<br/>\n&gt; different folder, you&#39;re protected against any filesystem oddities in<br/>\n&gt; deletion.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve been getting that on Windows 7 every now and then. Though it would <br/>\nusually happen less often than in the OP&#39;s case - maybe once in a <br/>\nhundred test executions. The NTFS file system has a thing called pending <br/>\ndelete and it sometimes prevents the file from being deleted right away, <br/>\nfor example if another process accessed it concurrently.<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3764072/c-win32-how-to-wait-for-a-pending-delete-to-complete\">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3764072/c-win32-how-to-wait-for-a-pending-delete-to-complete</a><br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve managed to work around the problem by repeatedly trying to delete <br/>\nthe file within a time limit.
