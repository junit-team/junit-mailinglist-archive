Using<br/>\n&gt; reflection to get at them is kind of like taking Tylenol without asking<br/>\n&gt; what else could be wrong.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Good design is easily testable. If you can&#39;t write test without special<br/>\n&gt; tricks, it&#39;s time to go back to your design and ask: do I really have<br/>\n&gt; good cohesion? Or, why is my coupling so bad that testing is hard.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Michael Feathers<br/>\n&gt; www.objectmentor.com<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed] </span></blockquote></div>",
