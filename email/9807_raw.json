The set of objects is the fixture.  The\n&gt; &gt; fixture is what you set up.  This is clear and unambiguous English\n&gt; &gt; from the authors of JUnit.\n\n&gt; &gt; For that matter, if I google I get\n&gt;\n&gt; Of what relavance is this?\n\nJB cited what appeared to be a quotation backing his interpretation of\nthe term.  He appeared to be claiming that it came from the JUnit Web\nsite.  I was investigating the claim.\n\n&gt; Google aparently limits it&#39;s reading to the web.\n&gt;\n&gt; Page 74-78, &quot;Test-Driven Development: A Practical Guide&quot;.\n\nHmmmm.  Doesn&#39;t appear to be the JUnit Web site ...\n\n&gt; &quot;The relationship of subclasses of TestCase and instacne of those\n&gt; subclasses is one of the most confusing parts of xUnit.  Each new kind\n&gt; of fixture should be in a new subclass of TestCase.  Each new fixture\n                       **\n&gt; is created in an instance of that subclass, used once, then discarded.&quot;\n             **\n&gt; and further on the same page:\n\nHoist with your own petard, I would say ;-)\n\n&gt; &gt; Not really.  A TestCase always contains a fixture.  This may or may\n&gt; &gt; not be clearly distinguished by putting it in a setUp() method, but\n&gt; &gt; it&#39;s the set of objects that you are running your test against.\n&gt;\n&gt; Which is what JB said.. and what I&#39;ve said, and what Kent&#39;s said...\n&gt; and many others as well.  The TestCase subclass is what defines a\n&gt; fixture.  setUp() just provides a tidy way of implementing that.\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; If we are going to be truly nitpicking,\n&gt;\n&gt; Oh, lets... I feel the need to be lectured in OO basics.\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; then recall that an object is an INSTANCE of a class.\n&gt;\n&gt; Well... not always... in the common-place OO languages, sure.  But\n&gt; sometimes it&#39;s a copy of a prototype.\n\nMy friend, this is the JUnit list.  We are talking about Java classes.\nYou may disparage Java as a commonplace OO language.  That&#39;s your right.\nBut in Java:\n\n&gt; &gt; A set of objects can never be a class.\n&gt;\n&gt; Um.. well... I sort of disagree.  What exactly is a class?  It&#39;s the\n&gt; describtion of a set of objects.\n\nIn Java a class is a very well-specified thing, and it not the same\nthing as a instance.  You really ought to know this.  Objects are\ninstantiated from classes using a well-defined set of operations, and\ngiven an object you can get back to its class.  But they aren&#39;t the\nsame thing, any more than a fixture is a TestCase or testing is the\nsame as test-driven development.\n\n&gt; &gt; It is  a set of instances of a set of classes.\n&gt;\n&gt; which (in cool OOPLs anyway) are in turn instances of metaclasses ;-)\n\nBut we, alas, are condemned to toil in the uncool world of Java and JUnit,\nwhere we have to make things work.\n\n&gt; &gt; My apologies to the wider world for starting this absurd thread\n&gt;\n&gt; No thread that stirs up dissention and discussion is absurd.  You\n&gt; would prefer that we all sit around typing mediocre rubbish and\n&gt; sedately nodding at each other?\n\nI think that that we could use our time more productively than this.\n\nI have been trying to decide whether unit testing is really applicable\nin multi-threaded applications, for example, and wondering how JUnit\ncould be extended to be useful in this area.  What I have seen so far\nalong these lines is most unsatisfactory.\n\n--\nJim Dixon  jdd@...   tel +44 117 982 0786  mobile +44 797 373 7881\n\n\n",
