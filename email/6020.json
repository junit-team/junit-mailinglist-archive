Can you start reading and once <br/>\n </span></blockquote>you <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; got enough data you write it as XML?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>That&#39;s exactly  what I meant by the second solution. I have a reader <br/>\nobject that after its execute() function being called returns a <br/>\nresult set. So the composer actully fetches the recordsed and writes <br/>\nout the read data. The benefit is that memory is allocated as lowest <br/>\namount as it needed but the disatvantage is the composer has to not <br/>\nforgetting to close the reader object otherwise the DB connection is <br/>\nleft open. <br/>\n<br/>\nAfter reading for awhile I found usefulness of MockObjects and found <br/>\nthat my obstacles may be overcome if I separate a too big function. <br/>\nThe function from inside called the reader featched the resultset and <br/>\ncomposed the output. If I make several small subfunctions then I <br/>\ncould test each of them separately with help of MockObjects. But then <br/>\nanother question comes in. Should I test the one big public function <br/>\n(that actually inside merely calls several small functions)? <br/>\n<br/>\nLet me make up an example:<br/>\n<br/>\npublic void buildReport(ReportSpec spec, OutputStream out) {<br/>\n  init(spec);<br/>\n  ResultSet rec = reader.execute(spec);<br/>\n  composeData(rec, spec, out);<br/>\n  reader.close();<br/>\n}<br/>\n<br/>\nlook at this snippet as at an logical example. I wrote an own test <br/>\nfor  each of internal functions by using MockObjects (if needed) but <br/>\nshould I test buildReport function? It seems to me I&#39;m just not able <br/>\nto.<br/>\n<br/>\nSorry for a long question.</div>",
