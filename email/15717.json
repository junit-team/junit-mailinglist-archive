Eclipse seemed to skip some tests in the 3.0.x branch (we would<br/>\n&gt; select 1 project whose tests would number N, its dependent projects<br/>\n&gt; would weigh in at M tests.  So you would expect N + M tests to have been<br/>\n&gt; run.  Not so.  It was N + M - X tests.  I don&#39;t know where things were<br/>\n&gt; getting lost.  I noticed this because I had a test in which I was<br/>\n&gt; forcing a failure and it never failed.  Why?  It never ran.)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yipe!
