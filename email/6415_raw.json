I&#39;m not really sorry at all.  It works\nmuch better when you don&#39;t have TestCases tied tightly to classes\nbeing tested.\n&lt;/aside&gt;\n\nTestCases and Classes being tested should have only coincedental\ncorrespondance.  A TestCase is the embodiment of a *fixture*... a\nspecific context in which tests are run.  As such it should contain\nonly those tests (i.e. test methods) which run in the context of the\nfixture that the TestCase embodies.\n \nAnd, anyway, tests are meant to test behavior,not classes.\n\n&gt; I only recently became enamored of JUnit, as a result of \n&gt; JUnitDoclet&#39;s creating a test framework for me. That shortened the \n&gt; JUnit learning curve, which helped a lot.\n\nAs I said above (and will again, watch for a CoadLetter issue on the\ntopic) there should be no explicit coorelation between classes being\ntested and TestCase subclasses.\n\n&gt; I&#39;m curious. Do you know of any IDEs that support this technique by\n&gt; generating static inner test classes?\n\nWell, Together does.  You can point it at a class and have it generate\na skeletal TestCase.  This is, IMO, at best useless, and at worst\ndisastereous.\n\nDave\n\n\n",
