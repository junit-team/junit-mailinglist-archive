Meaning that you&#39;ve got set/get methods for things that provide\nJavaMail interfaces in your Struts action.  So how are you currently\ninjecting the JavaMail objects into your Struts action??\n\nAssuming you are doing that, it could be as simple as mocking JavaMail\n(using easymock, for example, I don&#39;t know if mockobjects itself has\nJavaMail mocks) and injecting those to your Struts action in setUp.\n\nIf your struts action class hierarchy is &quot;hardwired&quot; to get references to\nJavaMail (e.g. through JNDI), then you&#39;ve shot yourself in the foot.  But\nI&#39;m thinking that&#39;s not the problem.  I think mocking JavaMail is the part\nthat&#39;s not done for you yet.\n\nForgive my obscurity around JavaMail.  It&#39;s not an API I&#39;m incredibly\nfamiliar with, but the external dependency problem is one I&#39;ve been dealing\nwith quite a bit.\n\nThe trick of subclassing the object you&#39;re testing to override and provide\nmock implementations of dependencies may not work with MockStrutsTestCase,\nbecause it&#39;s bound to the struts-config file to invoke the execute method.\nSeems like there should be some way to override that configuration to point\nto the subclass, but I&#39;m not sure how much that would buy you.\n\nPerhaps some code snippet from your action&#39;s execute method would help\nclarify your problem, or at least allow me/us to provide more concrete\nexamples of ways around.\n\nHope some of this helps.\n\nLater,\n-Larry\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: emilander [mailto:emilander@...] \nSent: Monday, December 20, 2004 1:32 PM\nTo: junit@yahoogroups.com\nSubject: [junit] Testing a Struts Action with a mock back end\n\n\n\nI am trying to write some unit tests for a Struts Action that uses \nJavaMail to send a message. It seems to do this I&#39;ll need to \n\n1 - Use a junit extension built for Struts\n2 - Use IOC to substitute a mock JavaMail implementation for the \nreal thing.\n\nI have found StrutsTestCase (http://strutstestcase.sourceforge.net/) \nas a framework for doing #1, but it does not seem to allow me to do \n#2. I could do #2 without #1 by refactoring into a helper class, but \nthat would leave the action untested.\n\nDo anyone have any ideas how to do both #1 and #2?\n\nThanks\nAlex\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nYahoo!
