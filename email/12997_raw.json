In the tested class &quot;new\nDate() &quot; returns always the current date and not the one which I set\nin my JUnit test.\n\nI have test data for business logic which I create before the test\nstarts and which contain absolute dates like 2004-12-31. So I need to\nmodify the system date for my tests.\n\nWhat I need to test is calculation of the average sold quantity. But\nonly the last X weeks (from today) need to be considered. My test\nsales data contains dates like 2004-12-31. Its much easier for me to\nwrite and understand data with such &quot;absolute&quot; dates instead of\nrelative dates (by rolling the dates around and not understanding it\nquickly). So it would be good for me to simply set the system date\nbefore the test starts and thus use absolute dates for my tests\ninstead of relative ones.\n\nOf course I could make the dates of the test data relative, but that\nwould be harder to code, understand and to maintain. It better for me\nto change the system time. But it needs to be done programatically in\nthe JUnit test and not manually by changing the OS date by hand.\n\nCan you provide a solution for that please?\n\n\n\n\n",
