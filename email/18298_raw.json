That=\r\n is why I suggested running as big part as possible outside the\ncontainer d=\r\nuring developmenttime.\n\nIf running your tests often does not feel that impo=\r\nrtant then by all means\nrun them inside a container. I&#39;m currently working =\r\nwith weblogic and I \ncan&#39;t\nimagine TDD:ing if I would need to deploy my new=\r\n code in the container in\norder to run my tests. It is simply too tedious. =\r\nIn my case 95% of the \ncode\nhas nothing to do with EJB:s whatsoever so i do=\r\nn&#39;t see that much added \nvalue\nof executing the unittests inside the contai=\r\nner.\n\nThat is just my opinion and also the reason why i don&#39;t know the answ=\r\ner to\nhow to run the tests inside the container. I never did it. Maybe it i=\r\ns\neasier in other containers.\n\n/J\n\nOn 11/2/06, C=E9dric Beust ? &lt;cbeust@goo=\r\ngle.com&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; On 11/2/06, Joakim Ohlrogge &lt;joakim.ohlrogge@...\n=\r\n&lt;joakim.ohlrogge%40gmail.com&gt;&gt;\n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Extract as much as possible=\r\n to classes that can be tested outside of \nthe\n&gt; &gt; application server.
