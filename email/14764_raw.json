The\ncompany I work for has developed this connector to an EIS written in\nC/C++. This JCA connector uses the Command design pattern in order to\nget/send and validate information on the EIS. \n\nNow they have added two new commands to this connector and I&#39;m\nsupposed to test them. As it&#39;s legacy code, there are no junit tests\nand I will be the first one to write them but only for those new\ncommands. My idea is to test the JCA connector out of the container\nand have a mock EIS since testing inside the container and connecting\nto the real EIS seems really painfull to me. :)  \n\nHowever, I have no clue how to do that cause the code under test does\nnot offer a way of receiving a mock object. This code instanciates all\nit needs within the Command method execute. \n\nIs there any framework that could help me in this challenging\nsituation? Something like simulating a fake container and EIS. I did\nsome googling over the internet and also searched over this group but\ncouldn&#39;t find anything :( Any ideas?\n\nregards,\nPatrick\n\n\n\n\n\n",
