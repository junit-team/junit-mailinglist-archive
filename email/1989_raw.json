Tyron&#39;s\nexmple seems more like a black box test rather than a white box one.  And a unit\ntest should be a white-box test.\n\nSo the example should be modified as the following:\n\nIf we are talking about an Order class, a call getStatus() to another layer (the\nclass should be known) with specified ProductID might return different status,\nPENDING (onhand and\nnot committed), COMMITTED(on hand but committed), IMMINENT(on order or imminent\narrival), PROTRACTED (protracted arrival), OUT_OF_STOCK(out of stock at the\nsupplier undetermined), UNAVAILABLE.  Depending on the return status of the\nproduct ID, a call to Order.create() method on a Order class might throw create\nan Order instance with PENDING status, a ProductUnavailableException, etc.\n\nThe point I am trying to make here is that because you know about the class\nimplementation, a unit is now finer grained in UT.  The language we are speaking\nin UT is programming-like rather than business like in AT.\n\nJason Rogers wrote:\n\n&gt;\n&gt;     &gt; I would like to hear everyones thoughts on the topic.\n&gt;     &gt; Your point about AT&#39;s\n&gt;     &gt; is well taken.\n&gt;     &gt;\n&gt;     &gt; To my way of thinking, flawed though it might be, a unit\n&gt;     &gt; describes one\n&gt;     &gt; scenario of one behavior.  For example, if we&#39;re talking\n&gt;     &gt; about an ordering\n&gt;     &gt; system, a specified product might exist in a number of\n&gt;     &gt; states, onhand and\n&gt;     &gt; not committed, on hand but committed, on order (imminent\n&gt;     &gt; arrival), on order\n&gt;     &gt; (protracted arrival), out of stock at the supplier (undetermined\n&gt;     &gt; availability) or perhaps even never available again.  A\n&gt;     &gt; customer wanting to\n&gt;     &gt; order that product might have patterned responses for\n&gt;     &gt; each of these states.\n&gt;     &gt; If the task at hand is to develop a system that will\n&gt;     &gt; automate the response\n&gt;     &gt; to a customer placing an order for this item, each\n&gt;     &gt; possible state and\n&gt;     &gt; outcome combination constitutes a unit.  Each test case\n&gt;     &gt; contributing its\n&gt;     &gt; behavioral rules to the design.\n&gt;\n&gt; I don&#39;t know, Jason.  It seems to me that unit is, for all intensive\n&gt; purposes, the class to be tested.  If all of these scenarios are present in\n&gt; that one class, then they can be tested at the &quot;unit&quot; level.  If the\n&gt; scenarios are a combination of objects and their interactions, I think the\n&gt; test raises to the &quot;acceptance&quot; level.  The thing I take issue with is your\n&gt; use of the term &#39;scenarios&#39;, because it conjures up ATs in my mind, but that\n&gt; may just be me.\n&gt;\n&gt; It all comes down to what is the best way to write unit tests.  Right?\n&gt; That&#39;s a heated discussion from which I have learned to stay away (for the\n&gt; most part).  Everyone has their style and most are very adamant about it.\n&gt; There are some general principles that we can all agree upon, but once that\n&gt; is done, the proofs are more or less stylistic.\n&gt;\n&gt; Some general principles can be found at\n&gt; &lt;http://www.javaworld.com/javaworld/jw-12-2000/jw-1221-junit-2.html&gt;.  I\n&gt; don&#39;t agree with the all of the things listed there, but most of it sounds\n&gt; good and right to me.\n&gt;\n&gt; -Jason\n&gt;\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
