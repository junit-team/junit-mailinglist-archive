Something like:<br/>\n<br/>\nassert_equal &quot;10 nuts, 10 bolts, 2 hinges&quot;, helper.method(order.products)<br/>\n<br/>\nwhich I thought was incredibly readable.<br/>\n<br/>\nLike for another test it created a string something like<br/>\n&quot;19Charactersxxxxxxx&quot;, which again was nice and readable.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt also generated exception tests.  It did however test the expected<br/>\nmessage which I think some people like to do and some do not.  Going<br/>\nforward it would be nice to see this type of decision configurable if<br/>\npossible.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn case I am out of  touch though, I am not aware of any other product<br/>\nwith this level of sophistication, am I correct?<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers<br/>\nShane<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nShane Mingins</div>",
