It does  sound a little scary -- at some point you get into &quot;why<br/>\n&gt; not roll my own&quot; territory, which is a dangerous way to be thinking!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I remember know that I did look at using Runner before but it wasn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; clear how to get back into the core functionality once I&#39;d implemented<br/>\n&gt; my own. I was looking at BlockJUnit4ClassRunner which sounds like its<br/>\n&gt; not what I want. Its still looking pretty complex to me even after<br/>\n&gt; looking at the SuiteRunner code but maybe I&#39;m just having a slow brain<br/>\n&gt; day. But it doesn&#39;t look like I can use inheirit from Suite or Parent<br/>\n&gt; Runner for example because they both are looking for a class.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You can actually give pass Suite a null for the parent class, and then<br/>\na list of subclasses.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &quot;A runner that creates a suite from a set of names should be<br/>\n&gt; straightforward given you can compute the number of tests beforehand,<br/>\n&gt; eg. because the class can already be loaded or you know the names of<br/>\n&gt; test methods per class from some other source.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; I think one question is the key make or break though -- does JUnit<br/>\n&gt; expect to traverse the entire test tree before running any tests?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yes.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; The<br/>\n&gt; reason I ask is because the above is not quite true -- I don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; actually know the names of the test methods at runtime, or at lest I&#39;d<br/>\n&gt; like to obtain them from the generated classes. To simplify down to<br/>\n&gt; brass tasks, what I basically need to do is use JUnit exactly the same<br/>\n&gt; way, except to substitute just one set of nodes in the test traversal<br/>\n&gt; tree -- for class discovery to load the classes by name.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>The division between<br/>\n<br/>\n1) Discover / Declare Tests<br/>\n2) Run Tests<br/>\n<br/>\nis unlikely to change any time soon.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; But the trick<br/>\n&gt; of course is that needs to be deferred until test run-time.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Does the test discovery step _need_ to happen inside a test computation?  Why?<br/>\n<br/>\nI have a feeling we have a mismatch of assumptions.<br/>\n<br/>\n   David Saff</div>",
