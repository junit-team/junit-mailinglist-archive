I think the best way to present my<br/>\n&gt;  confusion is to show to you an example where I think it would be perfectly<br/>\n&gt;  reasonable to not run some tests, because I know the _will_ fail if one<br/>\n&gt;  other fails:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  I&#39;m developing a system that handles (among others, but quite extensively)<br/>\n&gt;  persistence of java objects to a database. I&#39;ve built test cases for some<br/>\n&gt;  (far too few, but that&#39;s another problem) of the functionality, most of<br/>\n&gt;  which of course need a properly configured Database conection. Now I also<br/>\n&gt;  got a test that checks to see if the system can successfully connect to<br/>\n&gt;  the database. If this case fails then there are about 130 other tests that<br/>\n&gt;  will not produce anything useable. It would probably be possible to mock<br/>\n&gt;  the Database, but I can&#39;t really imagine how (without makeing the Mock so<br/>\n&gt;  unstable, that it won&#39;t help).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  What would you do about these tests in this case? Or am I talking about<br/>\n&gt;  something completely different?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I would mock it.  Hopefully, the database access is isolated enough that you <br/>\ncan do this.  The point is that there is code that is &quot;figuring&quot; out what <br/>\nneeds to be persisted and how.  You want to test that.  Your test of that <br/>\nisn&#39;t interested in whether or not the database actually received said <br/>\npersistence (those are other tests).  So, I would want those tests to <br/>\npass/fail on their own merit, not based on whether or not a DB was properly <br/>\nconfigured.  But again, perhaps I am just old-fashioned. ;)<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJason Rogers<br/>\n117 N.
