I see all the discussions going on and they are far beyond what I conceive that I have use for at the moment.<br/>\n<br/>\nPresently, I&#39;m developing part of a simulation system in Java for work, and I plan on using JUnit as part of NetBeans to do unit testing to bulletproof my code.  My question is, as I understand it, I can write a class and then &quot;right-click to generate JUnit test class&quot; or something.  So what happens when I update my real class with additional fixes and/or functionality?  Does NB/JU know to automatically update the test class, or do I have to regen the test class?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for your time,<br/>\nMike</div>",
