For<br/>\n&gt; example, if I have a junit test like junit&#39;s one that actually<br/>\n&gt; executes junit inside the test, it will screw up. Also, because of the<br/>\n&gt; timeout behavior, we&#39;ll introduce stuff from java.util.concurrent<br/>\n&gt; into the trace, which means we have to figure out *exactly* which<br/>\n&gt; methods there need excluding. In general, this is fragile. JUnit can<br/>\n&gt; easily get a stack trace from the method that calls user-code. This<br/>\n&gt; would at least allow a tool to find out exactly what frames needed to<br/>\n&gt; be killed.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;ll look at it a bit more.  The concern is that the same issues that <br/>\nmake this difficult and fragile for runner clients would make it <br/>\ndifficult for us to get right in JUnit.<br/>\n<br/>\n    David Saff</div>",
