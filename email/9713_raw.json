I come from a Smalltalk\nbackground where everything is public. You make things private through\nwhat is effectively a comment. I like this because you don&#39;t throw\narbitrary limitations on people who want to use or extend your\nframeworks but you do let them know that certain methods are subject to\nchange in the future so they can manage risk accordingly.\n\nTying this to my append below, if you publish APIs via Interfaces and\nmake methods in concrete classes public, indicating which methods are\nreally likely to change or go away via comments, others are free to\nextend the concrete classes as much as they see fit and assume as much\nrisk as they feel comfortable with.\n\n -----------------------------\n Mike Silverstein\n SilverMark, Inc.\n The Object Testing Company\n www.javatesting.com\n\n&gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; From: Michael Silverstein [mailto:msilverstein@...] \n&gt; Sent: Thursday, October 16, 2003 9:02 AM\n&gt; To: junit@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Subject: RE: [junit] Re: How to test private methods, its urgent\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Private methods are difficult to test because, after all, \n&gt; they&#39;re private. If you adopt a convention that API methods \n&gt; are only presented via Java Interfaces instead of concrete \n&gt; classes then you don&#39;t care about the way the implementers of \n&gt; the Interfaces are written. You can then make non-API methods \n&gt; within the concrete implementation public without implying \n&gt; that they are themselves API methods. \n&gt; \n&gt; You would also write your API tests for the Java Interfaces \n&gt; and plug in the concrete implementations to test them. If you \n&gt; need to write tests for lower-level supporting methods within \n&gt; the concrete classes you can do that separately, as \n&gt; appropriate and its easy because they are public.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; -----------------------------\n&gt; Mike Silverstein\n&gt; SilverMark, Inc.\n&gt; The Object Testing Company\n&gt; www.javatesting.com\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; &gt; From: Chirag Shashikant Doshi [mailto:chirag.doshi@...]\n&gt; &gt; Sent: Wednesday, October 15, 2003 11:02 PM\n&gt; &gt; To: junit@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; &gt; Subject: RE: [junit] Re: How to test private methods, its urgent\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Hi Michael\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Personally, I don&#39;t believe in private methods.

Therefore well\n&gt; &gt; tested public\n&gt; &gt; &gt; methods will include the behaviour of the private methods.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; There is no real reason for directly testing private methods.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Domain objects support the GUI.

Often you loose efficiency \n&gt; &gt; testing supporting methods indirectly via their caller - such \n&gt; &gt; as in the case where you want to test their ability to \n&gt; &gt; properly handle a range of input values. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Personally, I don&#39;t believe in private methods.
