I have to thank you,<br/>\n&gt;David, for putting this example in &gt;      the spotlight.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;      The second test may be better if it depends on the data from the<br/>\n&gt;classpath<br/>\n&gt;walker, rather than a mock<br/>\n&gt;&gt;      classpath walker. Presumably the mock classpath walker will be<br/>\n&gt;implemented to hardcode specified<br/>\n&gt;&gt;      classpath walking data, anyway. I propose to extract the classpath<br/>\n&gt;walking<br/>\n&gt;data, then, and pass it to<br/>\n&gt;&gt;      the second object, rather than mocking a classpath walker.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;J.B. I really have to thank you for not using this as an opportunity to<br/>\n&gt;distract. Right after I sent this I feared I&#39;d be told &quot;integration not<br/>\n&gt;unit&quot; and have the whole thread thrown out (or get side tracked) for that<br/>\n&gt;one thought. That would be a shame on one example.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Do you realize that by writing the foregoing you have insulted me?<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;I have to thank you for not being an idiot, because I expected you to be.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you felt this way and truly couldn&#39;t control your impulse to express it, you could at least have had the courtesy to do so in private.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;That all said, I half wonder if you are being tongue in check or<br/>\n&gt;something -- seriously -- because if you aren&#39;t joking, you said &quot;this test<br/>\n&gt;is best if it depends upon that test&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>If you interpreted it that way, then I miscommunicated. I clarified in another e-mail. Read that, since I think it more clearly indicates the degree of isolation I am suggesting you strive for.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;Further, you said use a side effect<br/>\n&gt;(saved result) of one test for the next. [If you are saying store it in a<br/>\n&gt;file, check that file in and test against it, then aren&#39;t we risking that<br/>\n&gt;the output changes and the test isn&#39;t truly valid?] This all confuses me,<br/>\n&gt;since it seems to go against so much of what you said.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Not what I meant. I realized that after the first reply.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Being more practical than purist I just need to know that my code works, I<br/>\n&gt;don&#39;t care too much what is an internal-to-my-code-integration test, or<br/>\n&gt;not.<br/>\n&gt;As such, I concur with what you are saying -- but I&#39;d have my second test<br/>\n&gt;use the class in the first, not us stored results or mock objects. I need<br/>\n&gt;to<br/>\n&gt;know that the solution I provide works as a unit (irrespective of user<br/>\n&gt;input/others) that is my goal for using junit. If not we could never junit<br/>\n&gt;anything above the JDK &#39;cos we&#39;d be doing &quot;integration&quot; test.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Agree with the last part. When we say &quot;integration test&quot;, we generally speak within the context of integrating with other application classes, and not the underlying platform.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;So, do we have a valuable concept of a dependency? If this is the best way<br/>\n&gt;for me, the user, is to test my code -- ought I be able to want it to stop<br/>\n&gt;if the walker failed?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>My other e-mail ought to make it clear that no dependency is required. Read it and we&#39;ll pick this up after that.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nJ. B.
