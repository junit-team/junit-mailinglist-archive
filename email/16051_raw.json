I have seen quite a few TDD enthusiasts choose not to use\n&gt;    debuggers for dogmatic reasons (&quot;because I read it in a book&quot;) and then\n&gt;    spend hours writing tests or even println&#39;s trying to reproduce a \n&gt; mysterious\n&gt;    bug that a breakpoint would have caught in a few minutes.\n\nWhile I agree with your overall point, I&#39;m surprised by this. If a \ndebugger could have found the problem in a few minutes, then why did it \ntake hours to write the tests? If I have to write 1 test per frame of \nthe stack trace, that&#39;s maybe 15-20 tests.\n\nNow, if it takes hours to write 20 tests, then they must not be very \ngood TDD practitioners; and if they&#39;re good TDD practitioners, then the \ncode is easy to test and it wouldn&#39;t take hours to write 20 of them.\n\nMy general approach is this:\n\n1. Reason about the problem. Try to write 2-3 tests.\n2. If #1 doesn&#39;t find the problem, launch the debugger and step until we \nfind the frame of the stack where the problem occurs.\n3. Find the values of the input to that method, then drop out of the \ndebugger and write the test. It fails.\n\nVoila. As you say, a /good/ marriage between debugger and tests.\n-- \nJ. B.
