I&#39;d <br/>\nrather have fewer new features that are well designed and developed <br/>\nthan many features that are poorly designed and implemented.<br/>\n<br/>\n- If you are going to transfer control to the community, why <br/>\nnot &quot;Community Planning Game&quot;.  That is, implement the XP Planning <br/>\nGame where the community is the customer.  The community could <br/>\nexpress what they desire (stories) and set priorities.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Providing hooks for extensions would be great.  Right now, the most <br/>\nfrequently use hook is subclassing.  Unfortunately this makes it <br/>\ndifficult to use two extensions at once.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Greg<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In junit@y..., &quot;Johannes Link&quot; &lt;john.link@g...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 2. JUnit as a political gesture celebrates the ability of <br/>\nprogrammers<br/>\n&gt; &gt; to test their own software. The code and tests must be held to a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; higher standard, to demonstrate the techniques necessary to uphold<br/>\n&gt; &gt; our end of the bargain.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;d like to add two aspects:<br/>\n&gt; - JUnit should be the stable angle for the very unstable projects <br/>\nwe all<br/>\n&gt; have to do. Changing too much jeopardizes stableness.<br/>\n&gt; - When adding too much non-core functionality one quickly looses <br/>\nfocus of<br/>\n&gt; the core parts. Very often the extra functionality is not exactly <br/>\nwhat I<br/>\n&gt; need in a specific situation, so I have to reimplement it anyway. <br/>\nIf the<br/>\n&gt; unneeded and unwanted part of a tool is prevailing many will move <br/>\ntowards<br/>\n&gt; starting from scratch with a new (small) framework. That&#39;s why I&#39;d <br/>\nrather<br/>\n&gt; have JUnit as a core with hooks to plug in additional behaviour <br/>\nwhich is<br/>\n&gt; available in additional tools.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; BTW, is the move to version 4 as described in<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?JunitNextRelease\">http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?JunitNextRelease</a><br/>\n&gt; an &quot;official&quot; thing, i.e. promoted by Kent and Erich?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Johannes </span></blockquote></div>",
