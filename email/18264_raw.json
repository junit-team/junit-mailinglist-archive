I think that doing this in even one or two classes \nmay well cut down on=\r\n a lot of the testing, and a lot of the Mocking, \ntoo. Thanks everyone for =\r\nyour help on this!\n\n\nBut I was also thinking about how we are using mocks a=\r\nnd JMock... \nUsing this tool demands that you define how each of the method=\r\ns called \non a mocked object behave. For a given method, you define what it=\r\n will \nreturn, and specify that you expect it to be called once, or twice, =\r\nor \nthat you don&#39;t care if it&#39;s called or not, and say what parameters you =\r\n\nexpect. \nSo, from the JUnit point of view, this means that we can test wha=\r\nt will \nhappen if the mock&#39;s method returns null, or an exception, or the t=\r\nhing \nwe expect, and so on. Whis is good, &#39;cos to get to this result \nother=\r\nwise could be hard, especially if it&#39;s a database you&#39;re talking \nto.\nBut t=\r\nhe other point of this, as I understand it, is to test that the \nroute you&#39;=\r\nre taking through your code is the one you expect to take. \nNow, this is wh=\r\nere some of the complexity comes in, because you have to \ndefine all the mo=\r\nck&#39;s method behaviour to support this, and even \nrelatively minor changes t=\r\no the code can hit this hard. The mock&#39;s \nmethod name has changed, or you m=\r\noved some code which doesn&#39;t need to \nget executed in case of an exception,=\r\n or.... and so on. The result of \nthe method you&#39;re testing is the same, bu=\r\nt how you did it has changed. \nSo the tests fail, as the methods you were e=\r\nxpecting on the mock object \nnow aren&#39;t called, and other ones are.\n\nSo, is=\r\n this kind of testing important enough to warrant all the effort \nit takes =\r\nto write & keep up to date? \nShould we care what method got called on our m=\r\nock, or even whether it \ndid get called at all? Or are we really only inter=\r\nested in the result \nof the main method we&#39;re testing?\n\nCheers, \nTracey\n\n\n\n=\r\n\n",
