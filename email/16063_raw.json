In JUnit we have assertEquals, not\n&gt; assertKindaLike. Assertions should be *exact* specifications of\n&gt; behavior.\n\nWhat test that /was/ passing then failed (or was failing, then passed) \nbecause of the subclass check? I understand that a different handler was \nbeing used, but to change from an unchecked exception to a checked \nexception seems to me to be a surprising and weird change without also \nwanting to change the exception handlers.\n\nAt any rate, none of that addresses your original point. How do you \nwrite a test that shows that the second handler is being hit when it \nshould? Do you throw an Exception in your test? Do you always either \nthrow just an IllegalArgumentException or a generic Exception in your \nproduction code?\n\nI&#39;m just trying to understand the forces that led to JUnit being the \nproblem, rather than either an underspecified test or an oddity in the \ndesign, because I have learned to trust JUnit when something weird like \nthis happens. I like to rule everything else out first.\n-- \nJ. B.
