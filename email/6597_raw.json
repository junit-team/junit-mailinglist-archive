Instead, I adopted a convention of having\nmy setUp()s perform the clean-up for the next test.  In other words, for a\ngiven test I do a pre-clean instead of a post-clean.  I&#39;m not sure if that&#39;s\ngood or bad...\n\nKendall\n\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: Brian br524-at-yahoo.com br524-at-yahoo.com |Yahoo Work 20030102|\nTo: XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX\nSent: Friday, January 03, 2003 10:47\nSubject: [junit] Re: Conditional tearDown()\n\n\nI only have one test in the TestCase, and if it fails, I want to leave\nthe database in the state it was in when the test failed so I can\ninspect what happened.\n\n--- In junit@yahoogroups.com, Mike Clark &lt;mike@c...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Brian  wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;I see in the TestResult class there&#39;s a method wasSuccessful().\nFrom\n&gt; &gt;within class that extends TestCase, I want to do something like\nthis:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;    public void tearDown()\n&gt; &gt;    {\n&gt; &gt;        TestResult result = createResult();\n&gt; &gt;        if( result.wasSuccessful() )\n&gt; &gt;        {\n&gt; &gt;            System.out.println( &quot;Clearing database&quot; );\n&gt; &gt;            clearDatabase( &quot;1&quot; );\n&gt; &gt;        }\n&gt; &gt;    }\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Is this intended to be more efficient than just clearing the\ndatabase\n&gt; every time the tearDown() method is invoked, or am I missing\nsomething?\n&gt;\n&gt; Mike\n\n\n\n",
