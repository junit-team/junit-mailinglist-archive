Since in my style of development I iterate<br/>\nbetween design, implement, and test several times a minute, I don&#39;t think<br/>\nI&#39;d like separate tools. I use the feedback from the results of each<br/>\nactivity to improve my decisions in the other activities.<br/>\n <br/>\nWhat I can see clearly is the need to be able to view and manipulate the<br/>\nspecification/design/tests in different ways to suit different purposes. For<br/>\nexample, you can translate a test or set of tests into a sequence diagram.<br/>\nSometimes I would like to see a summary of the design implications of my<br/>\ntests in this or some other graphical format.<br/>\n <br/>\nRegards,<br/>\n <br/>\nKent Beck<br/>\nThree Rivers Institute<br/>\n<br/>\n  _____  <br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a>] On Behalf Of J.<br/>\nB.

I expected to talk a little about Theories and<br/>\n&gt; assertThat, but we ended up having a wide-ranging discussion about a<br/>\n </span></blockquote>variety<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; of topics. I mind-mapped the result and put in on the conference wiki:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.agileope\">http://www.agileope</a><br/>\n </span></blockquote>&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.agileopennorthwest.com/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?FutureOfUnitTesting\">http://www.agileopennorthwest.com/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?FutureOfUnitTesting</a>&gt;<br/>\nnnorthwest.com/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?FutureOfUnitTesting <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.agileope\">http://www.agileope</a><br/>\n </span></blockquote>&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.agileopennorthwest.com/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?FutureOfUnitTesting\">http://www.agileopennorthwest.com/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?FutureOfUnitTesting</a>&gt;<br/>\nnnorthwest.com/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?FutureOfUnitTesting&gt;<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; The most surprising result to me was the interest in language features for<br/>\n&gt; testing-what would a language look like that included double-checking as a<br/>\n&gt; first-class concept? I was also surprised at how much commonality there<br/>\n </span></blockquote>was<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; between the unit and functional testing &quot;vendors&quot;, that reporting is a big<br/>\n&gt; issue for everyone.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; One thing missing from the discussion was much talk about the hopes and<br/>\n&gt; dreams of users, so I thought I would open up the question here. What is<br/>\n </span></blockquote>it<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; you wish your testing tool would do for you that it doesn&#39;t?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;m beginning to wonder whether we should have separate design and <br/>\ntesting tools. This seems to be a serious source of contention among <br/>\nprogrammers: we call it testing, but we mean design, and when we do <br/>\ndesign, testing is a secondary consideration, and yet testing is important.<br/>\n<br/>\nRather than repackaging TDD and calling it BDD, hoping that Sapir-Whorf <br/>\nwill save us from our own sloppiness, maybe it&#39;s time for separate tools <br/>\nfor design and testing. I have no idea how that would work, but perhaps <br/>\nit would help us all get along.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I&#39;d like a way to separate my design and testing activities when I do <br/>\nTDD. For example, when I test-drive behavior that doesn&#39;t yet exist, I&#39;m <br/>\nalmost always designing; but when I fill in the holes by adding a test <br/>\nfor a case that should already pass, I&#39;m testing. Perhaps it would be <br/>\nbetter to separate those somehow.<br/>\n<br/>\nAny ideas?<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJ. B.
