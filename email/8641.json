I thought of running the <br/>\n&gt;code in a new thread, and having the test wait for x seconds and if its<br/>\n&gt;not <br/>\n&gt;finnished, kill the thread and fail the test, but I&#39;m not sure...<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You won&#39;t want to write a test that says, &quot;Method X should halt after n seconds,&quot; because you could write that about every method. If you&#39;re doing performance testing, then that&#39;s different; but if you&#39;re just doing behavioral testing, then I wouldn&#39;t do that.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf a test never halts, interpret that as a failure. Been there. It&#39;s something outside the system that requires human intervention. The cost of replacing that with self-verification is prohibitive.<br/>\n<br/>\nHmmm. I would probably add a TimedTest (JUnitPerf) for that case, just to protect against regression.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nJ. B.
