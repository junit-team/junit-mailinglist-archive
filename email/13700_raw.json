For one thing, there \nmay be circular dependencies. The more complicated the system the more \nlikely this is. For another, it&#39;s not always obvious what depends on \nwhat. Trying to figure out the dependencies feel like more trouble than \nit&#39;s worth. In practice, I almost alway just look at the last change I \nmade. Normally it&#39;s obvious what I broke and how. Even in the occasional \ncase where it isn&#39;t obvious, I still know the change that caused the \nbreakage so I&#39;ll figure it out eventually. Finding the change that broke \nthe tests is 90% of fixing the problem. As long as we&#39;re testing \nfrequently, you can&#39;t make too many changes before noticing the breakage.\n\n-- \nElliotte Rusty Harold  elharo@...\nXML in a Nutshell 3rd Edition Just Published!\nhttp://www.cafeconleche.org/books/xian3/\nhttp://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0596007647/cafeaulaitA/ref=nosim\n\n",
