I prefer to think in terms of the behavior of objects\nand methods, not in terms of (procedural) code branches.\n\nHis first suggestion was to embed (in every method!) debug code that writes\nto a log and indicates that the method was executed.  I do not want to\npollute my code with piles of:\n\nif (debug_mode) { SomeGlobalLogFile.write(&quot;this method happened&quot;) }\n\nAny ideas on how to assure him that exhaustive testing of every outcome of\nevery public method will prove the system is working right?\n\n--  Norm\n\n\n\n\n",
