    "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-334354980\">I&#39;ve always thought that in retrospect one of junit (&lt;4)&#39;s  worse failings was creating <br/>\ninstances of the test classes up front in the suite. This means that <br/>\n* the contructors of all tests are called before any tests are run, leading to some <br/>\ninteresting issues if any initialization is done there instead of in setUp, <br/>\n* resources created in setUp and assigned to test class fields hang around until the end of <br/>\nthe test run, kept alive by the suite<br/>\n* we get some very different behaviour running all tests in ant using fork=true, compared <br/>\nto running all tests in the same VM<br/>\n<br/>\nNow in junit 4 it looks like the instances of test classes are constructed on the fly. The <br/>\nconstructor of each test instance is called just before @Before.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo my question - is this a designed behaviour? Can I assume that junit 4 runners will have <br/>\nthis behaviour, allowing me to use the constructor instead of @Before, allowing fields to <br/>\nbe final, etc? <br/>\n<br/>\nDoes anyone have experience of constructors v @Before in junit 4?<br/>\n<br/>\nFinally, is there scope for releasing the test class instances after each test has run? This <br/>\nwould give us a much smaller footprint for large test suites, without having to assign <br/>\nfields to null in @After.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks in anticipation<br/>\n<br/>\nDuncan Mc^Gregor<br/>\n&quot;The name rings a bell&quot;</div>",
