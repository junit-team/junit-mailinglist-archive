I&#39;d rather \ntest my own classes, and just assume that the framework works. Until \nproven wrong, I&#39;ll gladly believe in their &quot;zero bugs&quot; statement. :)\n\nIf you want to test the interaction of your classes with Prevayler, \nthen you shouldn&#39;t test the end result of the framework - you should \ntest the interaction itself. Mock objects might help here. You&#39;ll \nneed a Mock Prevayler though, which might not be trivial (I&#39;m not \nsure - I just started using Prevayler myself).\n----------------\nPaolo Perrotta\nBologna, Italy\n\n\n",
