I wasn&#39;t real clear in the email. The person in question made that\nstatement and that contributes to my skepticism. He also thought that junit\n&quot;generates&quot; tests.

First, I find\n&gt; &gt; that a little hard to swallow given the second statement about junit\n&gt; &gt; being the built-in testing generator provided by java (can you say\n&gt; &gt; non-sequitor?). Secondly, I cannot corroborate that statement via google.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; What I need is link to a document that explicitly corroborates or\n&gt; &gt; refutes the statement. So far, it looks like the statement is false\n&gt; &gt; but I am only using deductive reasoning there.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\n\n\n-- \n--\ndlm\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n",
