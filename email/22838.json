People who are non-java/non-junit are going to make changes to the database and stored procedures (for many different projects).<br/>\n<br/>\nQuestion:<br/>\nIs there an easy way for a non-java/non-junit person to, basically, one-click run unit tests to see if changes they made will cause issues to the existing regression/unit tests?  The ease-of-access and results is the key/critical part, as otherwise they will just keep asking development staff to run them and ask for feedback.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for any tips/ideas/tooling!<br/>\n<br/>\n-dhartford</div>",
