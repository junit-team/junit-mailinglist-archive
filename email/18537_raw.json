Whether\nthat&#39;s true or not is another discussion... (I&#39;m totally new to all this, so\nI have no idea.)\n\nWhat is the point of these mock object tools? I first read about mock\nobjects in a book on JUnit that had an example using straight JUnit to\ncreate the mock object and test it. What do these tools do that is special\nthat you can&#39;t do yourself - I haven&#39;t been able to figure out by their\nwebsites, perhaps somebody could explain it in simple terms?\n\nI&#39;m guessing it has something to do with emulating the use of another class\n(like MySQL drivers or whatnot) without actually having to program the mock\nobject yourself. What astonishes me is how these tools do that? Is it just\nthat you hope the tool you chooses supports what you need to be mocked (i.e.\nit has built-in mock objects), or do you specify the details of the class\nexcept the Java code and it just does the last step for you (i.e. generates\nthe Java code), or something else? Plese describe on a conceptual level if\nyou know.\n\nBasically, what all am I getting from one of these tools that I couldn&#39;t\nfrom just doing it myself? (I realize there are benefits, I just don&#39;t know\n- in beginner terms - what they are.)\n\nAlso, looking at the tutorials on rMock (and jMock, and easyMock which has\nthis issue but to a lesser degree), I realized that they are extremely\nsparse. Just a little more than a page is apparently enough to teach people,\nbut not me! Are people who are new to mock objects really supposed to\nunderstand it from their minimal Getting Started sections? Or is it just me?\nWhat&#39;s the best way for me to learn something like rMock?\n\nThanks.\n\n\n\nLasse Koskela wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; Hi &quot;veerukrishnan&quot;,\n&gt; \n&gt; On 12/13/06, lightbulb432 &lt;veerukrishnan@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt;  I&#39;m new to JUnit, and am wondering about using mock objects with JUnit.\n&gt;&gt; I wa\n&gt;&gt;  looking at www.mockobjects.com, and on the right side of the page it\n&gt;&gt; lists\n&gt;&gt;  &quot;implementations&quot;, and for Java it says jMock, EasyMock, and rMock.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;  What does it mean by implementations? What standard or specification are\n&gt;&gt;  they implementing, if any?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;  Or are they really very different things that only use the &quot;concept&quot; of\n&gt;&gt; mock\n&gt;&gt;  objects, but implement it very differently?\n&gt; \n&gt; EasyMock, jMock and rMock are not implementations of any standard or\n&gt; specification. They&#39;re implementations of the mock object pattern\n&gt; where you define &quot;expectations&quot; (expected interaction, method calls in\n&gt; Java) for a smart test double, which can then afterwards verify\n&gt; whether those expectations were met.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; On 12/13/06, lightbulb432 &lt;veerukrishnan@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt;  Any advice for a beginner as to which of those three implementations to\n&gt;&gt; look\n&gt;&gt;  at (any difference in functionality, robustness, or any other\n&gt;&gt; criteria?).\n&gt;&gt;  Looking at their websites I couldn&#39;t really tell what the main\n&gt;&gt; differences\n&gt;&gt;  are.\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;ve been personally using EasyMock for a long time. The reason for me\n&gt; having used EasyMock has really been just that I disliked the\n&gt; string-based approach of jMock (which doesn&#39;t work with automated\n&gt; refactoring tools too well, not to mention modern IDE&#39;s\n&gt; auto-completion features) and rMock has just recently appeared on the\n&gt; market.\n&gt; \n&gt; Functionally all of the above frameworks are almost identical so if\n&gt; you don&#39;t have any bias towards a specific library, I&#39;d recommend\n&gt; trying each of them out by writing a small set of tests with each\n&gt; alternative. For jMock, however, be sure to use the 2.0 branch from\n&gt; their Subversion repository as the API will change completely. They&#39;re\n&gt; dumping the string-based expectation setting API in the upcoming 2.0\n&gt; release (which Nat Pryce promised would be out real soon...).\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Lasse\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n-- \nView this message in context: http://www.nabble.com/Using-mock-objects-tf2812332.html#a7860038\nSent from the JUnit - User mailing list archive at Nabble.com.\n\n\n",
