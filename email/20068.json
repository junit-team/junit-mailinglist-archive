They&#39;re great and thanks for help, that really<br/>\nresolved most of my questions I had in mind about crap4j.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust in case if you&#39;re still on a look out for a &#39;Screen recording<br/>\nSoftware&#39;, I know a open source tool which is a really good one. you<br/>\ncan try it yourself...<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sourceforge.net/projects/camstudio/\">http://sourceforge.net/projects/camstudio/</a><br/>\n<br/>\nThanks and Regards.<br/>\nkumar.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;albsavoia&quot; &lt;albsavoia@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;edu_kumar&quot; &lt;sarat.beesa@&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I tried downloading it on my eclipse workspace couple of days back and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; had a trail run against Commons Collection API. It did showed a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; beautiful report with all the metrics in place, but I couldn&#39;t figure<br/>\n&gt; &gt; out what they actually meant. Is there a documentation available on<br/>\n&gt; &gt; how to understand these metrics ? I tried pondering around in your web<br/>\n&gt; &gt; site but ended up finding some blog posts rather than any<br/>\n&gt; &gt; documentation....  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Hi Edu,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I posted a 6 minute video on YouTube that shows the basic usage of<br/>\nCrap4J.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The video quality is rather crappy (how appropriate) but hopefully the<br/>\n&gt; basic idea comes across:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 1) Run Crap4J.<br/>\n&gt; 2) See which method are considered CRAPpy (due to an bad combination<br/>\n&gt; of complexity and lack of tests).<br/>\n&gt; 3) Cut the CRAP in those methods by a) adding tests or b) refactoring<br/>\n&gt; overly complex methods.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I am exploring options for higher-resolution video, but in the<br/>\n&gt; meantime you might want to check out this first attempt.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Here&#39;s the link to the YouTube video:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://youtube.com/watch?v=bV6IhUh0IH4\">http://youtube.com/watch?v=bV6IhUh0IH4</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Thanks,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Alberto<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>",
