Please, pick one of the many volunteers and work with him/her to automate deployment to Maven Central. This will literally save 1000&#39;s of wasted hours for devs around the globe. (As someone else already stated, there is zero practical chance of breaking someone&#39;s build when deploying a new release version.)<br/>\n<br/>\nMeanwhile I&#39;ve deployed the latest release versions of junit/junit-dep to my own Maven repo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://m2repo.spockframwork.org/ext/junit.\">http://m2repo.spockframwork.org/ext/junit.</a> Also I&#39;ve set up a CI build that will continually build and deploy the latest (4.9) snapshots to this repo. Hopefully this will help some people who, like me, can&#39;t wait any longer for the latest JUnit versions to appear in Maven Central. The repo also hosts Hamcrest 1.2, another important (and related) lib that isn&#39;t available from Central.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers,<br/>\nPeter<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a>, David Saff &lt;david@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; On Tue, Aug 17, 2010 at 6:28 PM, pniederw &lt;pniederw@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;ve noticed that JUnit includes an (outdated) version of Hamcrest. Will future JUnit version continue to ship with Hamcrest?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Yes, having made this decision, we&#39;ll stick to it until convinced it&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; doing more harm than good.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Do you have plans to update to Hamcrest 1.2 or higher?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Unfortunately, the last time we looked at the typing changes in<br/>\n&gt; Hamcrest 1.2, we found that we couldn&#39;t automatically upgrade people<br/>\n&gt; without changing compiling tests into non-compiling tests, and, if I<br/>\n&gt; remember, in a few pathological cases, passing tests into failing<br/>\n&gt; tests.  We guessed that of people who used the hamcrest features<br/>\n&gt; bundled with JUnit, there were more that would be hurt by a version<br/>\n&gt; change than would be helped by it, so we&#39;ve stayed here.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Why is there no junit-dep anymore, i.e. how are we supposed to use JUnit with Hamcrest 1.2?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; junit-dep has been up on github for every release.  Whoever has been<br/>\n&gt; putting JUnit up on maven, I take it, hasn&#39;t been also putting up<br/>\n&gt; junit-dep?  I&#39;m sorry to say that I&#39;m very aware that a lot of people<br/>\n&gt; are indebted to the anonymous time-donor who&#39;d been keeping the maven<br/>\n&gt; repos up-to-date until several months ago.  I&#39;ve been reluctant to<br/>\n&gt; accept full responsibility for feeding a repository I neither use nor<br/>\n&gt; fully understand until some point where I was sure I could quickly<br/>\n&gt; respond to millions of users who got their junit jars auto-updated in<br/>\n&gt; a way that broke all their tests.  This might be overly cautious of<br/>\n&gt; me.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;    David Saff<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Cheers,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Peter<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Yahoo!
