I connect to a data provider via an IP address. They have\n&gt; provided an API which I implement, and get callbacks from them with\n&gt; the data. I can create a mock of one of their classes - but since\n&gt; it&#39;s not hooked up to their IP, there&#39;s no data in it.\n&gt;\n&gt; I suppose I could decompile their class and put some data in it - but\n&gt; at that point, am I really testing my interaction with their classes -\n&gt; or with one of my own munging?\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks for any suggestions.\n&gt;\n\nAbout a year ago I had to get our application to work with another \napplication over JNI (they only had a C/C++ interface).   I did the \nfollowing:\n\n1. I wrote an interface that described how I wanted to access the remote \nAPI in terms of my\napplication (the Facade pattern)\n\n2. I wrote an implementation of that interface using fake data for \ntesting the rest of the system.\n\n3. I wrote tests of the real implementation against the real API (which \naccessed a local copy of the remote application). As the real API was \nnot always going to be available (licensing issues), these were \nseparated from the rest of the tests.  Some of these tests were also \n&quot;Learning tests&quot; to make certain I understood the remote API (and, in my \ncase, JNI, as this\nwas my first JNI project).\n\nI thus ended up with three kinds of tests:\n\n1. Learning tests to make certain I understood the API (and also \nprotecting me from changes to the API).\n\n2. Tests of my real implementation of the interface against remote API.  \nThese tests were separated from the standard set of tests.\n\n3. Tests of my application against a fake implementation.  These were \npart of the main set of tests.\n\nI hope this helps,\n\nKathy Van Stone\nkvs@...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
