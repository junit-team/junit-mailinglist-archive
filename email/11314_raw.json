Put your setUp and tearDown code in the TestCase.setUp() and\ntearDown() as usual.\n\n2. Declare your setUp() and tearDown() as final.\n\n3. Expose a new overridable method for clients to use.\n\nIn general, that&#39;s the approach I use when I want to allow subclasses\nto add functionality, but fear that they&#39;ll &quot;forget&quot; to call super(..).\n\nThis, of course, breaks every test currently written for your\nframework, and changes your API slightly from the very familiar JUnit\nAPI.  As a rebuttal (although I have no opinion either way) it isn&#39;t as\nthough it&#39;s a difficult fix since your compiler will tell you\neverywhere to do it.  \n\nAlternatively, whatever functionality your test classes provide could\nsimply fail with a useful message if the super.setUp() isn&#39;t called. \nCatching and reliably reporting a forgotten tearDown() call is tricker,\nthough.\n\nHope this helps,\n\nKevin Klinemeier\n\n--- Martijn Dashorst &lt;yahoogroups@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Hi,\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m a maintainer of jWebUnit and we&#39;ve got a problem with resource \n&gt; deallocation when many tests are run (1000+). This is due to the HTTP\n&gt; \n&gt; driver (WebTester) which is allocated in the constructor (bad policy,\n&gt; I \n&gt; know) and which is only freed when the TestCase is cleaned up by the\n&gt; GC.\n&gt; \n&gt; Now my question is: how do I allocate/deallocate the HTTP driver\n&gt; without \n&gt; needing my clients&#39; subclasses to call super.setUp() and \n&gt; super.tearDown() in their implementations of setUp()/tearDown().\n&gt; \n&gt; I was thinking of overriding runBare() in which I allocate the driver\n&gt; \n&gt; before calling super.runBare(), and in a finally block, I dereference\n&gt; \n&gt; the driver:\n&gt; \n&gt;   public void runBare() throws Throwable {\n&gt;       try {\n&gt;           tester = new WebTester();\n&gt;           super.runBare();\n&gt;       } finally {\n&gt;           tester = null;\n&gt;       }\n&gt;   }\n&gt; \n&gt; This allows subclasses of WebTestCase to override setUp() and\n&gt; tearDown() \n&gt; without requiring them to call super.setUp()/tearDown().\n&gt; \n&gt; This is rather risky, for I have no guarantee that runBare() is\n&gt; called \n&gt; in each environment (ant, Eclipse, IntelliJ, etc).\n&gt; \n&gt; Creating my own WebTestCase extends Assert implements Test would\n&gt; require \n&gt; me to implement a lot of code, not just delegation, or am I missing \n&gt; something?\n&gt; \n&gt; I hope you could shed some light on this.\n&gt; \n&gt; Martijn Dashorst\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n\n\t\t\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
