Mike&#39;s chapter was very good, but it was<br/>\n&gt; &gt; almost pointedly devoid of TDD. The test-later approach that the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; chapter took left the example relatively untested.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Nevertheless I am very pleased with the testing orientation of Rails,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and am looking forward to seeing that very active and energetic<br/>\n&gt; &gt; community continue to embrace the disciplines of TDD.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I am finding it difficult to do TDD with Rails, mostly because I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; expecting to use the same dependency injection techniques there as I use<br/>\n&gt; with Java, and that doesn&#39;t seem to fly. For this, I have two questions:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; * Does anyone else have this or a similar problem?<br/>\n&gt; * Would someone point me to a place to discuss those problems?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thanks.<br/>\n&gt; -- <br/>\n&gt; J.
