You should be able to\nfind many resources on this.\n2) Getting those tests to run from maven.  I have little to contribute here,\nbut others on-list or on Google might.\n3) Optimizing the acceptance-test-writing process.  In the absence of strong\nAI, the process of translating business requirements into acceptance tests\nis always going to be an engineering task, which needs skill and time in\nyour process.  I would suggest owning it as an engineering team, with gentle\nhand-off of small parts as it becomes _obvious_ people closer to product\nownership can do them.\n\nHope that helps,\n\n   David\n\nOn Tue, Feb 24, 2009 at 7:45 AM, majkic@... &lt;majkic@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt; WOW. I&#39;m really impressed with seriousness you approached to\n&gt; acceptance testing.\n&gt;\n&gt; On the other hand it seems that much work was involved to make this\n&gt; acceptance framework work fine.\n&gt;\n&gt; I would like to make our Selenium tests work automatically from CI\n&gt; server (linux server without X), as any JUnit test would work. This\n&gt; way our Product Owner (yes, we&#39;re Scrumming) could write all necessary\n&gt; acceptance tests instead of descriptive acceptance criteria.\n&gt;\n&gt; CI is executing &quot;mvn clean install&quot; periodically and it would be great\n&gt; if we could automate this process.\n&gt;\n&gt; Any ideas?\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt; Marko\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In junit@yahoogroups.com, Fredrik Wendt &lt;fredrik@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; On fre, 2009-02-20 at 13:25 +0000, majkic@... wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Hi guys,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I need to create automated acceptance tests. Selenium seems to be\n&gt; &gt; &gt; nice, since it allows someone without much (or none at all)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; programming experience, as our Product Owner to create those tests\n&gt; &gt; &gt; with Firefox Selenium IDE plug-in.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; But time has come to integrate those tests to other JUnit tests, so\n&gt; &gt; &gt; these can be run on CI server.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Disclaimer: No JUnit, no Selenium-RC used in the solution below.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; What we did is to put all Selenium tests (HTML source) in a separate\n&gt; &gt; web-app, bundled with Selenium Core and an index.jsp that starts the\n&gt; &gt; test automatically when called by a browser. (We also mangled Selenium\n&gt; &gt; Core to let a USERNAME and PASSWORD Selenium variables be set and\n&gt; &gt; present in all tests - mangled means five lines of javascript code.)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; To have it run in a CI environment ... I wrote two applications:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; a) a simple app called &quot;test agent&quot; that can take two commands over\n&gt; &gt; XML-RPC:\n&gt; &gt; a1) start a browser pointing it at a certain URL (pointing to the\n&gt; &gt; index.jsp file mentioned above, also telling the browser where the\n&gt; &gt; selenium result should be posted)\n&gt; &gt; a2) stop a browser\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; b) A web-app called &quot;test conductor&quot; that\n&gt; &gt; b1) keeps track of test agents\n&gt; &gt; b2) aggregate results returned from browsers\n&gt; &gt; b3) register test new test runs and launch them when test agents become\n&gt; &gt; idle\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; This works well and having the test files in HTML (with human readable\n&gt; &gt; ID values on all elements the test interacts with) makes it useful for\n&gt; &gt; manual testing as well. Since the web-app with test can be deployed on a\n&gt; &gt; developers machine, a developer can also ask the test conductor to run a\n&gt; &gt; test off the developer&#39;s machine (and start debugging server side).\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; There&#39;s no JUnit integration. We just added a simple script on our CI\n&gt; &gt; environment (Hudson) that after each successful build of the full\n&gt; &gt; software stack does:\n&gt; &gt; i) download the build artifacts, deploy them to a test server\n&gt; &gt; ii) register a new test run with web-app b mentioned above\n&gt; &gt; iii) waits for b to return a fail/success\n&gt; &gt; iv) undeploys the artifacts from step i\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; This was all setup one year ago - the client I worked for wasn&#39;t sure\n&gt; &gt; what Selenium could do or if they wanted to invest time using it. Having\n&gt; &gt; the test written/saved in human readable HTML was a good selling point -\n&gt; &gt; if they decided to not go with Selenium then the tests could still be\n&gt; &gt; used &quot;as is&quot;.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Since then:\n&gt; &gt; Selenium 1.0 still hasn&#39;t been released.\n&gt; &gt; There&#39;s still no Selenium Driver that can use HTML files as source.\n&gt; &gt; 3000+ runs completed.\n&gt; &gt; We run test agents for FF2, FF3, IE7, Safari on Mac.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Parts of the test agent and test conductor is BSD-licensed, some parts\n&gt; &gt; where developed for the client (and I think they&#39;ll be happy to share\n&gt; &gt; under BSD-ish license).\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; / Fredrik\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
