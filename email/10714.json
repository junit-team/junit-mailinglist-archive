The problem I have is on the first failure, the tests<br/>\n&gt; discontinues and the rest of the array is not checked.  This makes<br/>\n&gt; sense because of the exception that is thrown and handled by JUNIT. <br/>\n&gt; Is there a away I can keep the loop running until it finishes all the<br/>\n&gt; strings.  I can catch the exception but how do I add it to the<br/>\n&gt; current aggregate test results that JUNIT is keeping track of.  Also,<br/>\n&gt; is this the best way or proper way to do this?  I don&#39;t think it<br/>\n&gt; makes very much sense to write a test method for each string in the<br/>\n&gt; arry, it wouldn&#39;t be very scalable or dynamic.  Thanks in advance for<br/>\n&gt; any help or advice. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>The xUnit philosophy is for tests to be focused and that tests either <br/>\npass or fail.

If you have different <br/>\nassertions that should evaluate separately from one another, then try <br/>\nimplementing them as separate tests.<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJ. B.
