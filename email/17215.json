    "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-530543216\">For those who haven&#39;t followed the private methods discussion:<br/>\n<br/>\nMy opinion is that people use files too much in Java and that<br/>\nStreams/Readers/Writers should be the first choice. I created a new<br/>\nsubject to discuss this. It is a bit off topic but I care too much<br/>\nabout the subject to let it go :)  (sorry)<br/>\n<br/>\nI also want to point out that eventhough Cederic is quoted here I have<br/>\nno reason to beleive so far that we are somehow in oposition. It was<br/>\nmerely the queue that made me want to ask some questions to the list.<br/>\nSo here goes:<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nCederic Wrote<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;  Of course, it&#39;s very important to give low-level functions to achieve that<br/>\n&gt;  goal, but the fact that more than ten years after its inception, Java still<br/>\n&gt;  doesn&#39;t have a File#readEntireFile is absolutely baffling.  I must have<br/>\n&gt;  written this function dozens of times myself.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>What would a generic readEntireFile return? Should there be a<br/>\nreadEntireFileAsByte, readEntireFileAsChar, readEntireFileAsLines.<br/>\n<br/>\nI must admit that I have never created a readEntireFileMethod. I<br/>\nusually want to do something with the contents and then I usually end<br/>\nup with some kind of parseStream/parseWriter thingy. Why would I read<br/>\na file into memory and transform it form there when I can transform it<br/>\nwhile reading it?<br/>\n<br/>\nI have clearly have issues with files and I must admit that I always<br/>\nfind it a bit annoying when I see methods taking a file but not an<br/>\nequivalent taking a Stream. I think that the Stream API is much<br/>\nunderused by too many Java programmers and that most of the time I see<br/>\n&quot;File&quot; in code it should read &quot;Stream&quot;. Some argue that Streams are<br/>\ntoo complicated. I don&#39;t understand that really,  I think that it is<br/>\neasier to use streams/readers/writers than files since they are more<br/>\ngeneric and your toolbox becomes so much wider with hardly any effort<br/>\nat all.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am probably to constrained in my thinking here and that is why I<br/>\ncan&#39;t see a generic readEntireFile that I miss... I have to think<br/>\nharder, there is probably a whole world out there that I have not<br/>\nexplored :).<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat do people on the list prefer? Working with Files or<br/>\nStreams/Readers/Writers? For what reasons?<br/>\nPlease share your thoughts.<br/>\n<br/>\n/Joakim Ohlrogge</div>",
