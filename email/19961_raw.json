Only the duplication in product code should be\n&gt; refactor.Do you think so��\n\nI think that duplication between test production code *is* a smell - if \nperhaps not an as strong one. When I seen duplication such as in your \nexample, I would still think a while about why it&#39;s there and how I \ncould get rid of it - and most often that will lead to some insights and \nan improved design, in my experience.\n\nHope this helps,\n\nIlja\n\n",
