Unit tests often test the interplay of two or<br/>\n&gt;    three<br/>\n&gt;    &gt; methods, or even of several objects. You can&#39;t do this (effectively)<br/>\n&gt;    &gt; with embedded assertions.<br/>\n&gt;    If you use Design by Contract then the implementation can be checked<br/>\n&gt;    by<br/>\n&gt;    the compiler to be valid or not. No JUnit needed. Focus on writing<br/>\n&gt;    proper contracts instead of proper tests.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This is an uneducated statement -- why don&#39;t you spend some time learning<br/>\nwhat testing is about before making these assumptions!  The compiler is<br/>\nactually on one kind of test.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;    &gt; Do you have a pointer?<br/>\n&gt;    I don&#39;t know what you mean.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I think he meant do you have a POINT...<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;    &gt; That&#39;s wrong, as others already stated.<br/>\n&gt;    But how will you test a method which returns nothing?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>As was said before, check the state the system is in before and after<br/>\ncalling the method.  For example, return a DB connection to a Pool. <br/>\nCheck the DB pool to make sure the connection is there.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;    &gt; Asserts are even less a guarantee. Asserts need to be executed to be<br/>\n&gt;    &gt; effective - if you don&#39;t have external code invoking them in a well<br/>\n&gt;    &gt; directed manner, they will not be of any use until in the production<br/>\n&gt;    &gt; environment.<br/>\n&gt;    In my following posting I favor Design by Contract instead of just<br/>\n&gt;    using<br/>\n&gt;    assert statements. I replied to myself. Read the thread when it<br/>\n&gt;    appears.<br/>\n&gt;    &gt; If you really prefer this way, it wouldn&#39;t be too hard to include<br/>\n&gt;    the<br/>\n&gt;    &gt; unit tests into your production code. Most people seem to prefer to<br/>\n&gt;    &gt; seperate the two.<br/>\n&gt;    I prefer Design by Contract. Most people don&#39;t know that paradigma.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Many of us here are quite familiar with DBC -- again you make uneducated<br/>\nassumptions.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;    &gt; Junit doesn&#39;t force you to develop test-driven at all.<br/>\n&gt;    It suggests it strongy I think. Otherwise the synchronisation of code<br/>\n&gt;    and test is endangered.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>The ASSUMPTION you make here would be nice if it were true, however, it<br/>\nis not.  You obviously don&#39;t quite understand TDD/TFD.  Go study some<br/>\nmore.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;    &gt; You might fear that it is. In practice, it doesn&#39;t seem to be that<br/>\n&gt;    way.<br/>\n&gt;    If you use TDD in its intended form than you lose time. Thats my<br/>\n&gt;    opinion.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It would be better to back it up with real experience.  I have done a lot<br/>\nof development, using a lot of approaches and methodologies.  I<br/>\npersonally have found myself to go MUCH faster with TDD.  But I won&#39;t<br/>\ntake the time to belabor this point until you do more of your own<br/>\nhomework, or ask intelligent questions instead of throwing out these<br/>\nridiculously unfounded _opinions_!<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;    &gt; minutes. There are even tools to automate this. My IDE shows me<br/>\n&gt;    wether I<br/>\n&gt;    &gt; run the tests since the last code change, and an integration server<br/>\n&gt;    &gt; emails me if I broke a test nevertheless.<br/>\n&gt;    Still much work. I prefer to concentrate on code and not on test<br/>\n&gt;    quality.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I believe that most folks who understand unit testing would agree that<br/>\nfocusing on test quality IS focusing on &quot;code&quot; -- it sounds like you are<br/>\njust LAZY!<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;    &gt; So, did that help?<br/>\n&gt;    Yes.<br/>\n&gt;    Using Design by Contract is in a way a medium between implementation<br/>\n&gt;    and<br/>\n&gt;    tests. It is not as abstract as the implementation but not so<br/>\n&gt;    concrete<br/>\n&gt;    as the tests. Read my second thread (I replied to myself).<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I could really flame you here, but I think I have said enough.<br/>\n<br/>\n=jason<br/>\n=jason<br/>\n[:question | ^One]</div>",
