Something along the lines of &quot;test or don&#39;t test the accessor methods, it&#39;s your choice!&quot; :-) Some of us like to do that and some of us don&#39;t, both view points are valid and both should be accepted/respected. But it might be good to have that explained really well in the FAQ to help the signal/noise ratio. (That being said, the signal/noise ratio around here is far in favour of signal! :-)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Sure.
