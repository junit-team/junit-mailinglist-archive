So i create\na MockStatement and say &quot;ms.setExpectedUpdateCalls(3)&quot;, or something to that\neffect, and pass it in to my object.\n\nIn my view, this is tantamount to designing a &quot;probe&quot; which will fit through\none of the holes in the box (ie conforms to the public interface), thereby\nallowing us to snoop on what is happening inside the box.... Now, maybe i&#39;m\njust misunderstanding the terminology, but my gut tells me that this should\nnot count as &quot;black box&quot; testing.\n\nAnd if this is &quot;black box&quot; testing, what the heck counts as &quot;white box&quot;\ntesting?\n\n\n-Brian\n\n\n\n",
