B. Rainsberger&quot; &lt;jbrains@r...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt; &gt;So said Paul Zabelin on 2003-05-28 --------------------\n&gt; &gt;1. Separates Exceptional behaviour test code. Throwing exception \ncan \n&gt; &gt;be slower compared to normal workflow. Failure on exception class \ncan \n&gt; &gt;be classified as exceptable for code shipment, while normal test \n&gt; &gt;failure has to be a showstoper.\n&gt; \n&gt; we cannot solve in time to ship the product, but failure to handle \n&gt; an exception must not automatically be considered less important\n&gt; than correctly handling the &quot;happy paths&quot;.\nOf course, it is better to consider them equaly important.\n\n&gt; &gt;2. Fails if wrong exception class thrown or nothing was thrown.\n&gt; \n&gt; That&#39;s not always enough: does the exception object thrown contain \n&gt; adequate information to describe the exception?\nIf it is not enough, then it is normal path and should be tested as \npart of normal TestCase. If you have one line code within each test \nmethod you would worry less from where exception was thrown.\n&gt; \n&gt; Exception tests in particular are more of a design tool than a\n&gt; testing tool: writing good exception tests leads to better\n&gt; exception classes, which leads to higher serviceability and\n&gt; maintainability, \nStill test cases code should be written, until design tools can \nautogenerate them. Most code for exceptional test cases is in setUp() \nmethod to prepare objects in state, which can lead to an exception. \nThen single method call on an object we test should throw expected \nexception. Test methods can be organized to call exception causing \nmethods.\n\n&gt; People who do not practise TDD probably think exception tests are a\n&gt; waste of time and they wouldn&#39;t be far off. Exception tests show \n&gt; their value most in the context of TDD.\nI have not practised complete TDD project, and I think exception \ntests are very important. Even I prefer to have them organized in a \nseparate test case classes.\n\n&gt; &gt;3. Typical exception cause is wrong method parameters or \n&gt; &gt;preconditions. So it takes a lot of tests to be written to create \n&gt; &gt;different exceptional conditions.\n&gt; \n&gt; Wrong method parameters or failed preconditions indicate a bug\n&gt; elsewhere, and not a bug in the method trying to receive those\n&gt; parameters. It usually indicates that the caller is not adequately\n&gt; tested. &quot;Defensive programming&quot; is truly paranoid programming and\n&gt; should be avoided.\nDefensive programming is an extreme. But often it worth to reject \ninvalid paraters immediately, rather than let them slip futher in \nstack. I am using same approach as java.util.Vector class from Sun&#39;s \nJDK 1.4 source. It has very good examples of parameter checks and \ndocumentation.\n\nIf parameter is not an ANY value for it&#39;s type, then there is an \nexceptional path and it should be tested. For example if an object of \nsome class is used as a parameter we need to consider a case of null \nreference. Some method can take null as a normal value, others will \nhave NullPointerException, which should be included in javadoc. Third \ntype of methods may throw another type of exception including \njava.lang.IllegalArgumentException\n\n\n\n",
