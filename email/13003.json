Rainsberger<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jbrains@...\">jbrains@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; Kevin Klinemeier wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Heh, to quote Yogi Berra, &quot;It&#39;s like Deja Vu all over again&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; It&#39;s OK, Kevin; you can just summarize. I know the issues, and I&#39;m not<br/>\n&gt; trying to force you to type too much.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Oh, I&#39;m not offended or anything of the sort.  I&#39;m just chuckling that<br/>\nyou and I specifically have discussed this issue before.  I&#39;m a quick<br/>\ntypist, and I ought to be: I have all this practice from documenting<br/>\nmy test methods and assert statements!  :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Just like the test name often needs further clarification (never pass<br/>\n&gt; &gt; up an oportunity for documentation), often the reason for the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; assertion is not self-apparent.  You can try to argue that &quot;it ought<br/>\n&gt; &gt; to be, or rewrite your code!&quot; but, as before, I think you&#39;re straying<br/>\n&gt; &gt; too close to the &quot;Java code is self-documenting&quot; argument, which I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; find ... dubious at best.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I don&#39;t know. I just wrote this in an XHTMLUnit test today:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; assertXpathExists(<br/>\n&gt;      somewhereThereIsA(formNamed(&quot;demographics&quot;))<br/>\n&gt;      .eventuallyContainingA(textFieldNamed(&quot;firstName&quot;)), document);<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; This translated to the XPath expression<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;      //form[@name=&quot;demographics&quot;]//input[@type=&quot;text&quot; and @name=&quot;firstName&quot;]<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Is a comment or a failure message going to make that clearer?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I haven&#39;t had a need for XHTMLUnit, I&#39;m mostly commenting about<br/>\nvanilla JUnit usage.  That said, what message does the above generate<br/>\nin your error report?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; Or to put it pithily:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I feel that I&#39;m proficient with Java, but when I want to explain<br/>\n&gt; &gt; something, especially *why* something, I generally prefer English.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I agree and explain &quot;why&quot; in English, but nost of the time, test case<br/>\n&gt; class name, method name and line number is enough for me to know what<br/>\n&gt; failed, from which I generally can determine why it failed. If not, then<br/>\n&gt; my tests are too big (and that&#39;s an entirely different problem).<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Do you have the same experience with tests you&#39;re not the author of? <br/>\nThis is where I&#39;ve found it especially helpful, or frustrating if it<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t exist.  Of course *my* logic and reasoning is always obvious,<br/>\nit&#39;s those other punks that write stuff I can&#39;t understand. <br/>\n(sarcasm!)<br/>\n<br/>\nThese additional comments have also been helpful if I&#39;m debugging a<br/>\nsection I neither wrote, nor studied the original requirements.  An<br/>\nexample of that situation is code written for features implemented<br/>\nbefore I joined the proeject.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Kevin</div>",
