I am also a firm belei=\r\nver in\nJUnit especially if you use Test-driven development. My experience\nt=\r\nells me that it does make a significant difference especially if you\nwant t=\r\no add lots of new features all the time.\n\nMy experience is mainly from come=\r\nrcial projects and lately from\nparticipating in the development of rMock ht=\r\ntp://rmock.sf.net\n\nLet me put it this way:\n\nIf you don&#39;t have the tests to =\r\nprove that your system works, adding\nnew features, and knowing you didn&#39;t b=\r\nreak anything that used to work,\nis way harder than if you have them.\n\nToda=\r\ny I would actually think twice if I knew that a comercial product\nwas not p=\r\nroperly unit-tested before buying it, I would not trust its\nquality since I=\r\n have seen the difference in my code and other peoples\ncode when changing t=\r\nowards TDD.\n\n\nAs a concrete example of where my faith in unit tests comes f=\r\nrom:\n\nSome years ago I was a tech-lead (coding tech-lead) for a web-based\na=\r\npplication, one of many in a portal. &quot;my&quot; application was supposed to\ngo li=\r\nve together with a similar application (in terms of complexity)\ndeveloped b=\r\ny another company.\nI had managed to get the customer interested in TDD (tha=\r\nt to them was\nthe same as having automated unit tests) and they had agreed =\r\nto let me\n&quot;prove my point&quot; on this project well aware that this might take =\r\na\nlittle bit more time since we were all inexperienced in TDD (they were\nwi=\r\nlling to take the risk since they saw a potential benefit in higher\nquality=\r\n and less bugs since going live in that system was\ntraditionally tedious an=\r\nd error-prone. A bug in a component requires a\nnew turn in that procedure s=\r\no it is better if it works when they go\nlive ;))\n\nThe development was no pi=\r\ncknick, TDD is not a silver bullet and you\nmake mistakes while you learn ho=\r\nw to master it. This application was\nno exception.\nAfter we went live only =\r\n2 bugs have ever been discovered and none of\nthem serious. The other applic=\r\nation had more than 100 reported bugs of\ndifferent levels chriticality the =\r\nfirst week.\n\nI attribute this difference mainly to the fact that we had uni=\r\nt-tests\nand the others didn&#39;t (It would be tempting to think that we were\ns=\r\nimply that much better and smarter but realistically: our choice of\nenginer=\r\ning approach was better in this case). It is also interesting\nto note that =\r\nwe did not need more time to finish our application than\nthe other team did=\r\n, I think that this is bvecause they spent more time\nin word than we did an=\r\nd we spent more time in code than they did,\nrelying more on our testcases t=\r\no drive the design and acting on the\nfeedback we got from our tests. In fac=\r\nt our server side components\nwere live 1 week before theirs.\n\n\nDo I think u=\r\nnit testing takes more time? Yes and no:\n\nYes - because there is more code =\r\nto write, and in the beginning there\nis a learning curve. I would say that =\r\nyou would experience a drop in\nproductivity the first couple of months unti=\r\nl you get the &quot;hang of it&quot;\nTDD is a new way of thinking but it is worth lea=\r\nrning. I think TDD is\nalmost as big of a change as it is to change from pro=\r\ncvedural oriented\nthinking to OO thinking, you never stop learning and it w=\r\nill take you\nyears to master it (although you will get benefits from it muc=\r\nh earlier)\n\nNo - because you tend to write less &quot;unused code&quot; simply becaus=\r\ne\nhaving to have a test for every line of code you write makes you\nreluctan=\r\nt to do &quot;might be good if I want to do this in the future&quot;\nkind of design s=\r\ntunts. This also comes from the knowledge that\nchanging the code to support=\r\n those &quot;might be good to haves&quot; is\nstraight forward, if you have the tests,=\r\n when they change from &quot;might\nbe good&quot; to &quot;are necesary&quot;.\nLess &quot;might be go=\r\nod to haves&quot; alsoe leaves less production code to\nmaintain wich saves some =\r\neffort, I don&#39;t remember who said that he\n&quot;would rather have his developers=\r\n surf the web than adding code that\ndid not immediately provide any value&quot;.=\r\n An interesting thought.\n\nNo - Because you tend to do less bug-hunting sinc=\r\ne your code usually\nworks.\n\nNo - Because your design, with TDD, tends to be=\r\n simpler, more to the\npoint and better when you drive it with tests (when y=\r\nou learn how to\ndo that, before that you will just have very complicated te=\r\nsts and the\nsame design).\n\nYes - Because if you have not been doing test-dr=\r\niven development so\nfar your design will likely be hard to test until you r=\r\nemedy that. To\nfix that is time well spent since a testable design is usual=\r\nly an\nextendable one and when you have your tests you will see that you can=\r\n\nadd new features faster than you thought were possible. But\nproductivity w=\r\nill no doubt drop until you have spent some time\nrefactoring for testabilit=\r\ny (and fixing what you break/try to prevent\nto break stuff while doing that=\r\n since you have no tests at the moment)\n\nI am not saing that your design is=\r\n bad, I&#39;m saying that it is unlikely\nto be very good for testing if that ha=\r\ns not been a design-goal (from\nmy experience)\n\nAbout testing web-based appl=\r\nications and the effectiveness of unit\ntests I would say that JUnit is equa=\r\nlly appropriate for web, but, with\nJUnit you test one class at the time (if=\r\n you do it interaction based)\nor several classes from one class at the time=\r\n (if you are doing\nstatebased testing). In order to find bugs in your HTML =\r\netc you need\nsystem tests and other tools (or add ons) to test that. (The e=\r\nxample I\ngave you was a unit-tested serverside with a manually tested\nprese=\r\nntation layer). What you want to do though is to put as little\nbusiness log=\r\nic in your presentation layer as you can (that is put no\nbusinesslogic ther=\r\ne) so that all your businesslogic can be unit\ntested. When you have that yo=\r\nu find a lot fewer bugs in your\npresentation-layer.\n\nMore and more tools ar=\r\ne available testing web apps, I heard about but\nnever tried &quot;selenium&quot; try =\r\nthat one.  And I also recomend looking at\nwww.testdriven.com to see if you =\r\ncan find anything that suits you. But\nregardless of wether you test the gen=\r\nerated html or not you can still\nrely on the fact that what is beneath your=\r\n presentation-layer works.\n\nSorry for the blah, blah response I easilly get=\r\n caught up in these\nthings :) I hope you could distill something useful fro=\r\nm this massive\namount of text :)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
