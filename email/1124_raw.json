(export DISPLAY=144.230.1.1:0)  Then all\nof the gui rendering will leverage the graphics\ncapabilities of the remote X Server.\n\nAlso you could run a virtual display on the testing\nmachine.  Something like Xvdm which will let you keep\nthe tests isolated to a single machine.  In this case\nyou would still need to export your DISPLAY as above\nbut would look something like this &quot;export\nDISPLAY=localhost:100&quot;.\n\nI have tried both of these techniques with java and\nthey work great!\n\n--- Brian Button &lt;bbutton01@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; My problem is that I designed a Java GUI using TfD,\n&gt; and now I want to\n&gt; run these unit tests, along with the rest of my\n&gt; tests, during my\n&gt; nightly build. I&#39;m building on a Unix machine, which\n&gt; means that the\n&gt; java ui has to connect to an X server somewhere. If\n&gt; it doesn&#39;t, then\n&gt; all the gui-related tests fail, since they can&#39;t\n&gt; open their windows.\n&gt; \n&gt; Has anybody solved this problem before? The best\n&gt; answers I can come up\n&gt; with are to either separate out the gui tests that\n&gt; require a window to\n&gt; be opened (anything dealing with geometry it seems),\n&gt; or replace the\n&gt; visible windows with in-memory windows and see if\n&gt; that helps. \n&gt; \n&gt; Any suggestions are welcome...\n&gt; \n&gt; bab\n&gt; \n&gt; -- \n&gt; Brian Button            bbutton@...\n&gt; Senior Consultant       Object Mentor, Inc\n&gt; St. Louis, MO\t\thttp://www.objectmentor.com\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
