I try to be clearer with my problem.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have a method getConnection that uses a datasource to get a <br/>\nconnection from the connection buffer pool with the websphere <br/>\napplication server. I have some other methods that call this method. <br/>\n<br/>\nif those methods are called by a jsp or a servlet running on the <br/>\nserver then everything is fine. However, when any of those method are <br/>\ncalled by a Junit method, then getConnection fails. I need to say <br/>\nthat my JUnit tests also reside within the same web application <br/>\nworkspace in wsad.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf it comes to worst,I can write a getConnectionMock method that uses <br/>\na jdbc to get a connection but that means everytime I test my code, I <br/>\nneed to change the source code.<br/>\n<br/>\nIs there a way around it, I would really appreciate your replies in <br/>\nadvance.<br/>\n<br/>\nregards,</div>",
