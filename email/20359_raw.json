I\nhave =\r\nused almost exact the same mechanism in JUnit 3.8 for making the\nparametriz=\r\ned test. There is one little disappoint though. Now every\nparametrized meth=\r\nod must be in separate class that is not very good.\nEven if there is 2 [b]r=\r\nelated[/b] tests it is impossible to use the\nsame in the single class. That=\r\n is because Parameterized runner expects\nonly one constructor. So neither a=\r\nnother parameterized, neither\nregular test can&#39;t be added. I think this sho=\r\nuld be revisited.\n\n\n",
