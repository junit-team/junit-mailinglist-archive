The DB is now well enhenced &\ncontains a flush on close so the deleted records a re definitively removed,\netc...\nEverything has been done in the almost purest JUnit style (must admit many\ncoding followed by testing, but there&#39;s none piping over my schoulder, so\n;-) ).\n\nI&#39;d like now to change the accessor of some methods from public to\n&quot;friendly&quot; or protected for some methods as they are not needed for the\ncaller anymore.\nMy question is twofold :\n    1�. What are the possibilities ?\n        Would simply moving the TestCase as inner\n        class suite the matter.\n    2�. Am I&#39;m better to make all the TestCases member\n        of the package of the class to test & make the accessor\n        protected ?\n\n\nTx for advice,\n\nThomas,\n\np.s. :\nTo read with a sens of humour\nI was wandering if some of the fossiles wagging around this web site could\nlay down some of their best advices on testing private/protected methods &\ntesting with inner classes.\n\n\n\n\n\nhttp://groups.yahoo.com/group/junit/message/3542\n\n--\n\nThomas SMETS - Certified Java Programmer\nrue J.
