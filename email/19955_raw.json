Tests are running =\r\nOK\nwhen I run each of them individually. Every time I run a testSuite I\ngot=\r\n a summary report about what methods failed and which passed. I\nthink this =\r\nis Junit&#39;s expected behaviour.\n\nThe point is that when I try to run my test=\r\nSuites alltogether at a\ntime, I got no summary (just a line telling me the =\r\nmost general test,\nthe one which launches the other testSuites, passed). It=\r\n seems that\nJunit stops quietly, so I am afraid it may fail. \n\nOn the other=\r\n hand, I forced some of the tests to fail, then I got some\nsummary output b=\r\nut only for those methods which failed. \n\nI do know whether this is related=\r\n to my code or is it an issue from\nJunit. I would be glad if anybody famili=\r\nar with this could shed some\nlight...\n\nThanks in advance\n\nDiego\n\n\n",
