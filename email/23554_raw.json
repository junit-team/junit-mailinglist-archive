It seems that since NB has built-in JUnit support (i.e. Run File), I\n&gt; don&#39;t need to have an associated Main class under the Test Packages.\n&gt; True or false?\n\nTrue. Nearly every testing and building tool out there finds all tests \nautomatically.\n\n\n&gt; 2. If I do decide to use a Main class as my test harness for my JUnit\n&gt; classes, I assume I have to declare an instance of the test class. True\n&gt; or false?\n &gt;\n&gt; 3. Furthermore, if I were to instantiate the test class and run it under\n&gt; my Main, wouldn&#39;t I basically have to make a call to each test* method\n&gt; explicitly? It seems like &quot;Run File&quot; does that for me.\n\nIn the main method you would use \nhttp://junit.sourceforge.net/javadoc/org/junit/runner/JUnitCore.html and \ngive it a list of all test classes (or suites which contain the test \nclasses). JUnit will create the test class instances itself (actually \nonce per test method) and call the test methods.\n\n\n&gt; 4. I was able to just do &quot;Run File&quot; on AngleTest.java and it ran for me\n&gt; in a split screen window at the bottom of NB. Kind of cool - gives me\n&gt; pass/fail and TTE (time to execute) stats. I noticed, however, that\n&gt; everything failed because JUnit by default puts in some boilerplate\n&gt; lines of code:\n\nIt&#39;s NetBeans (or whichever tool you used) that generates the \nboilerplate, not JUnit.\n\n\n&gt; 5. Am I supposed to go ahead and customize the values and/or code in the\n&gt; auto-generated test methods to test what I want? What&#39;s the better\n&gt; approach: Add more code for more test cases inside the method, or keep\n&gt; changing the existing code and re-running it until I&#39;m satisfied with\n&gt; the test results?\n\nThe best approach would be to write all tests manually. That way you can \nwrite meaningful tests which describe the features of the system. See \nhttp://blog.orfjackal.net/2010/02/three-styles-of-naming-tests.html\n\n\n&gt; 6. If I deliberately set the result and expResult to be two different\n&gt; things and also remove the call to fail(), will assertEquals() take care\n&gt; of raising a flag saying, &quot;Hey dummy, your results didn&#39;t match!&quot;?\n\nTry it. (The answer should be yes.)\n\n\n&gt; 7. What happens if I set a value for the angle in degrees and make a\n&gt; call to something like setDegrees(value)? How can that even fail anyway\n&gt; (i.e. what&#39;s the point of having the test method)?\n\nIt won&#39;t fail. There is no point in testing things such as trivial \nsetters/getters (and language features such as the `new` operator). \nThose will be tested indirectly when you write tests for features which \nuse them. Write tests for (all) things which could possibly fail.\n\n\n&gt; 8. If I just remove the auto-generated calls to fail() as the comment\n&gt; suggests, then how am I going to know if my test is failing or not?\n&gt; Essentially what I&#39;m seeing is that I can rig the test however I want,\n&gt; which is not entirely what I&#39;d like to happen.\n\nTo find out whether a test works, modify the production code so that it \nhas a bug in the feature which is being tested by the test. Good tests \nfail: http://www.agitar.com/downloads/TheWayOfTestivus.pdf\n\nAn even better way is to write the tests before the production code. \nFirst the test will fail because the system doesn&#39;t yet do the thing \nwhich is specified by the test. Write code until the test passes. Remove \nduplication and fix bad names \n(http://www.jbrains.ca/permalink/the-four-elements-of-simple-design). \nRepeat.\n\nHere is a tutorial to get started: \nhttps://github.com/orfjackal/tdd-tetris-tutorial\n\n\n&gt; P.S. I realize it would probably be helpful to attach both Angle.java\n&gt; and AngleTest.java. If anyone has a suggestion for what to do about\n&gt; that, I&#39;ll gladly post them. (Neither class is proprietary.)\n\nI don&#39;t know whether this mailing list allows attachements, but whatever \nthe case, it&#39;s always possible to use https://gist.github.com/ \nhttp://pastebin.com/ or a similar site for sharing snippets of code.\n\n-- \nEsko Luontola\nwww.orfjackal.net\n\n",
