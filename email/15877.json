The need for <br/>\n&gt; integration testing is greater than ever before, but the time QA has <br/>\n&gt; for that activity is reduced to such short periods that that type of <br/>\n&gt; testing is relegated to last, IMHO. <br/>\n </span></blockquote>Bob,<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you for un-lurking.  I think I could learn something from your <br/>\nexperience.  I&#39;m not sure, though, if your response was directly to <br/>\nJ.B.&#39;s comment, or to the tone of discussion in general.  J.B. suggests <br/>\nthat if programmers don&#39;t test their own code, it wastes QA time.  Are <br/>\nyou saying that if programmers don&#39;t test their own code, they get it to <br/>\nQA quicker, giving more time for effective QA?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks again,<br/>\n<br/>\n    David Saff</div>",
