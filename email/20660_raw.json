Especially since my remote test env needs to be =\r\non Windows  :-S\n(Background: I want to use WebDriver to test our Webapps, a=\r\nnd that\ninvolves IE...).\nAnyway, though I have previously written that Grid=\r\nGain seems to be\noverengineered, I have given it a try nethertheless and I =\r\nam\npleasantly (!) surprised. It is very easy to setup and you can run\nyour =\r\nUnit tests on any node in the grid nearly without any code change\nto your e=\r\nxisting Testsuites- absolutely cool.\nSo anyone in need of running JUnit tes=\r\nts remotely, give GridGain a try.\n\nBest regards,\nLudwig\n\n\n--- In junit@yaho=\r\nogroups.com, &quot;Nat Pryce&quot; &lt;nat.pryce@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; How about ssh?\n&gt; \n&gt; You=\r\n can use sftp to copy the files to the remote machine and then ssh\n&gt; to run=\r\n ant.\n&gt; \n&gt; Or, to avoid the sftp stem, use NFS to share the drive on the bu=\r\nild\n&gt; machine with the remote machine.\n&gt; \n&gt; --Nat\n&gt; \n&gt; 2008/7/4 ludwig.adam=\r\n &lt;ladam@...&gt;:\n&gt; &gt; Hi,\n&gt; &gt; i am currently looking for the a solution to remo=\r\ntely run JUnit tests\n&gt; &gt; from our cruise control (cruise control runs ant w=\r\nith JUnit, tests\n&gt; &gt; should run on remote machine).\n&gt; &gt; After searching for=\r\n a while I found that the Eclipse JUnit integration\n&gt; &gt; features this but I=\r\n didn&#39;t find a standalone-version. In addition\n&gt; &gt; GridGain (http://www.gri=\r\ndgain.com/) seems also to support this, but is\n&gt; &gt; too overengineered for m=\r\ny case. Do you know any alternatives / good\n&gt; &gt; solutions for this scenario=\r\n?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Thanks & Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; Ludwig\n\n\n\n",
