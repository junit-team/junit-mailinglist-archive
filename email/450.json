This is what<br/>\nsetUp() and tearDown() usually take care of. <br/>\nWhen you rely on a certain order what do your follow-up tests do when<br/>\none of their precessors has failed? Removing test order dependeny often<br/>\nrequires some refactoring of the tests and of the classes under tests.<br/>\nEvery time that I had to do this refactoring I ended up with an improved<br/>\ndesign, i.e. one with less overall dependencies and better overall<br/>\ntestability.<br/>\n<br/>\nJohannes<br/>\n<br/>\nHeinz van Pee wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; Hello,<br/>\n&gt; i have a question about JUnit:<br/>\n&gt; Is it possible to influence the order of the Tests?<br/>\n&gt; I have some test methods in a Testcase and would like to<br/>\n&gt; have them executed in a specific order, for some tests<br/>\n&gt; reley on the success of others.<br/>\n&gt; Is there any way to do this?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Kind Regards,<br/>\n&gt;     Heinz van Pee </span></blockquote></div>",
