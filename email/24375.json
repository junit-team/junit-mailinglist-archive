I was waiting for David to respond (I am a<br/>\nsometimes contributor) but here are my thoughts.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is an interesting idea. Note that you could get what you want with a<br/>\ncustom runner.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy concern with adding Rules via system properties that someone running the<br/>\ntests in their IDE would see different results compared to the test runs<br/>\nfrom Maven. Sure, you could tell your IDE to run the tests with the same<br/>\nsystem properties, but it would be unexpected for most people to have to<br/>\ntake a special step to make the tests run the same way as they did in the<br/>\ncontinuous build.<br/>\n<br/>\nCould you find some way to define the global rules via code? Perhaps you<br/>\ncould add a DynamicRule to all of your tests that could apply the addition<br/>\nrules. Alternatively, you could have a class in the same package as the<br/>\ntests that defined the global rules for tests in that package (though I&#39;m<br/>\nnot sure there is a platform-independent way to scan all of the classes in<br/>\na package that works for all runtime/deployment environments)<br/>\n<br/>\n-- Kevin<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Mon, Apr 29, 2013 at 7:09 AM, Henning Gro� &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:igaffai@...\">igaffai@...</a>&gt;wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; **<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hi!<br/>\n&gt; I have a use-case where I need to enable rules based on external<br/>\n&gt; parameters.
