In the tested class &quot;new\n&gt; Date() &quot; returns always the current date and not the one which I set\n&gt; in my JUnit test.\n&gt; \n&gt; I have test data for business logic which I create before the test\n&gt; starts and which contain absolute dates like 2004-12-31. So I need to\n&gt; modify the system date for my tests.\n&gt; \n&gt; What I need to test is calculation of the average sold quantity. But\n&gt; only the last X weeks (from today) need to be considered. My test\n&gt; sales data contains dates like 2004-12-31. Its much easier for me to\n&gt; write and understand data with such &quot;absolute&quot; dates instead of\n&gt; relative dates (by rolling the dates around and not understanding it\n&gt; quickly). So it would be good for me to simply set the system date\n&gt; before the test starts and thus use absolute dates for my tests\n&gt; instead of relative ones.\n&gt; \n&gt; Of course I could make the dates of the test data relative, but that\n&gt; would be harder to code, understand and to maintain. It better for me\n&gt; to change the system time. But it needs to be done programatically in\n&gt; the JUnit test and not manually by changing the OS date by hand.\n&gt; \n&gt; Can you provide a solution for that please?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; Yahoo!
