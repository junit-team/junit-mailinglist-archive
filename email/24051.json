This will be posted now and then; not often<br/>\nenough to be spam, but often enough to keep our newer members aware of how<br/>\nwe conduct business around here.<br/>\n<br/>\nDear members and readers of the JUnit mailing list,<br/>\n<br/>\nAround here, we love testing. Not only do we love testing, we love to<br/>\ndiscuss any and all aspects of testing, often with enthusiasm and passion.<br/>\nThis is good. This is the reason that this mailing list exists. On top of<br/>\nall this, we are very keen to help others understand this strange<br/>\naffliction we have; medical name &quot;testus infectus&quot;, better known as being<br/>\ntest infected. We love to answer questions and help those new to the joy<br/>\nmove further down the road towards test enlightenment. In the classic<br/>\nspirit of hospitality, our list is your list, our test cases are your test<br/>\ncases. Please make yourself at home and enjoy the journey. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nThat said, there are some things that we don&#39;t love, so sit tight and<br/>\nlisten up.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe don&#39;t love people who haven&#39;t, or won&#39;t, read the JUnit Frequently Asked<br/>\nQuestions (FAQ) document, lovingly maintained by Mike Clark or the &quot;Smart<br/>\nQuestions&quot; document written and maintained by Eric S. Raymond. Here are the<br/>\nlinks, go forth and read ...<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://junit.sourceforge.net/doc/faq/faq.htm\">http://junit.sourceforge.net/doc/faq/faq.htm</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html\">http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\nWe don&#39;t love people who think that we&#39;ll do their homework assignments for<br/>\nthem. Back when I was a lad, we didn&#39;t have the Internet and we had to do<br/>\nour own homework assignments without the aid of all the knowledge and<br/>\ninformation that you have available to you today. (And yes, now that you<br/>\nask, I did walk uphill both ways to school through the snow.)<br/>\n<br/>\nWe don&#39;t love people who are incapable of using a search engine, but are<br/>\nyet somehow capable of signing up onto this mailing list so that they can<br/>\nask questions that ten seconds of searching would reveal the answer to.<br/>\nLearn how to use a search engine. Around here, Google seems quite popular.<br/>\nHere&#39;s a link; learn to love it and use it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.google.com/\">http://www.google.com/</a><br/>\n<br/>\nWe don&#39;t love job postings. We do love having jobs (or at least, we like<br/>\nthe pay) and we do like to look at job postings, but we like to look at<br/>\nthem in more logical places like job websites. So, please don&#39;t be upset<br/>\nwhen a moderator deletes your carefully worded prose describing yet another<br/>\ntesting job.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe don&#39;t love thread hijacking. That&#39;s when you start a different subject<br/>\nby replying to a previous conversation and not even changing the subject<br/>\nline. We like to discuss a variety of subjects, so please feel free to be<br/>\ninspired to ask side-questions during ongoing conversations. Just do so by<br/>\nstarting a fresh thread with a unique subject line.<br/>\n<br/>\nLastly, we don&#39;t love people who whine, moan and generally sound like<br/>\npetulant children after they&#39;ve been told that they have violated one of<br/>\nthe &quot;laws of the land&quot; around here. It&#39;s a big old Internet; feel free to<br/>\ntake your questions and/or tantrums somewhere else if you don&#39;t like the<br/>\nway we do things around here.<br/>\n<br/>\nSimon<br/>\n(One of the JUnit mailing list moderators)<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nsimonpeter.org | simonpeter.com | newlife-upc.org<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",
