I&#39;d have to disagree.\n\nThat might be a simplification of my position.\n\n&gt;JUnit is a TESTING FRAMEWORK. By using it, testing should be made easier. \n&gt;I&#39;d like to not have to reinvent the wheel for many of these assertions. I \n&gt;understand that I can easily write my own assertion library in just a \n&gt;couple hours but why should I have to?\n\nWell, you don&#39;t. Just write methods that answer boolean and use assertTrue() \nor assertFalse(). The only difference is that you&#39;re writing:\n\npublic static boolean somethingIsTrue() {\n    return someBooleanCondition;\n}\n\nand using it this way:\n\nassertTrue( &quot;Hey man, it ain&#39;t good.&quot;, somethingIsTrue() );\n\nas opposed to writing\n\npublic static void assertSomethingIsTrue( final String failureMessage ) {\n    assertTrue( failureMessage, somethingIsTrue() );\n}\n\nand using it this way:\n\nassertSomethingIsTrue( &quot;Hey man, it ain&#39;t good.&quot; );\n\nOf course, you may want a version with and without the failure message, so \nas not to make it mandatory.... aww, hell, you&#39;re just rewriting \nassertTrue(), anyway.\n\n&gt;Certainly, after years of use, we have identified many assertions that \n&gt;would be useful to the community at large. As they are identified, it seems \n&gt;natural for JUnit to provide them in future releases.\n\nMaybe this is just an issue of terminology. There are no new assertions, \nmerely new boolean conditions to assert. The assertion mechanism itself is \nnot what&#39;s new. Hell, even assertEquals() is just a shorthand for\n\nassertTrue( equals( a, b ) );\n\npublic static boolean equals(final Object a, final Object b) {\n    return (a == b) || (a != null && a.equals(b));\n}\n\n(Of course, assertTrue( a.equals(b) ) is no good, since a could be null and \nthis would blow up.)\n\nSo if you find yourself writing assertX() methods that do nothing more than \nturn around and use some method that answers a boolean, it is cleaner simply \nto use assertTrue() and assertFalse() around your boolean method.\n\nI would be interested in seeing an assertX() method whose boolean condition \ncouldn&#39;t be easily refactored out without overly affecting the unit test. \nThis refactoring would reduce coupling and increase cohesion. Good Things, \nno?\n\nJ. B.
