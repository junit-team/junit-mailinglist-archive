I think\nI&#39;m settled on this one.\n\n&gt; #2 - T=\r\nhere&#39;s some kind of Junit additional package that does all of this \n&gt; stuff=\r\n - Its at http://gsbase.sourceforge.net/ \n&gt; &lt;http://gsbase.sourceforge.net/=\r\n&gt; - take a look\n\nPERFECT! This is exactly what I was hoping to find (to sav=\r\ne my\nhaving to write it). With LGPL, I *think* I can use it... I&#39;ll\ncheck w=\r\nith the author to make sure.\n\n&gt; #3 - Have you looked at Aspect Oriented Pro=\r\ngramming yet? This might get \n&gt; around some of your issues. Check it out at=\r\n http://aspectj.org/\n\nMy influence on this project doesn&#39;t extend NEARLY as=\r\n far as being able\nto suggest the use of AOP.\n\n&gt; Finally, there&#39;re some oth=\r\ner JUNIT best practices articles out there - \n&gt; try this one at \n&gt; http://w=\r\nww.javaworld.com/javaworld/jw-12-2000/jw-1221-junit.html\n\nFairly introducto=\r\nry, but a nice reference. I think I&#39;ll include it\nin the materials I hand o=\r\nut when encouraging others to USE unit\ntesting.\n\nThanks for a prompt and he=\r\nlpful response!\n\n-- Michael Chermside\n\n\n",
