I suspect<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; you&#39;re not an asshole, so I imagine you mean something else. I would<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; appreciate you clarifying this position. Is it necessarily the case,<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; then, that &quot;the sort of programmers who... hang out on lists like this<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; one&quot; don&#39;t know what we&#39;re talking about, because I kinda think I do and<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; I kinda think I&#39;ve proven that.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; You do know what you&#39;re talking about, and you are practitioners, as am<br/>\n&gt; I. However you&#39;re making the classic mistake of assuming that everyone<br/>\n&gt; else is just like you, and that what works for you works for them. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Thanks. I wanted to be sure that was the case before I moved much <br/>\nfurther forward. I appreciate the clarification.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; This<br/>\n&gt; is a *HUGE* and unrecognized fallacy that underlies a lot more than<br/>\n&gt; programming methodologies. For instance, it&#39;s largely responsible for<br/>\n&gt; the failure of modern elementary and secondary education, which works<br/>\n&gt; for maybe 5% of children. However that&#39;s those 5% that go onto become<br/>\n&gt; teachers and principles and propagate the same techniques to future<br/>\n&gt; generations, while ignoring the failure of 95% of their students.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I think I understand exactly where you&#39;re coming from here.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; The simple fact is that people learn and think differently. No one<br/>\n&gt; technique works for everyone, but some techniques do work for more<br/>\n&gt; people. We tend to self-select into groups that think similarly and<br/>\n&gt; learn similarly to ourselves. The people who like interfaces are a<br/>\n&gt; self-selected group of programmers who think at a very high degree of<br/>\n&gt; abstraction, even for programmers (already a self-selected and abstract<br/>\n&gt; bunch). This doesn&#39;t mean they don&#39;t produce quality software. It does<br/>\n&gt; mean that you can&#39;t expect what works for them to work for all or even<br/>\n&gt; most developers.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Thank you, Elliotte, for making that clearer.<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJ.
