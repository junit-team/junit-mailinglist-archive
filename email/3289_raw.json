I said\nthat I think the advice to always run the debugger on every line of\ncode one writes (as quoted from Code Complete) is not applicable when\none does test first programming.\n\n&gt; * You&#39;ve inherited some code from someone. It&#39;s badly named, barely \n&gt; commented, undocumented, and there are no unit tests. What does it\n&gt; do?\n\nOf course, when the assumed test first approach (which I *thought* I\nexplicitly stated) is missing, a debugger may be helpful. I&#39;ve actually\nfound it more useful to convert the untested code by adding tests and\ndesign by contract assertions.\n\nDebuggers are not inherently evil. Personally, I find little use for\nthem, but they are not inherently evil. I recognize that my personal\nlack of desire or need for a debugger does not mean that everyone else\nshould share my attitude. Nonetheless, I find that the Code Complete\nadvice (practically a demand) to always run a debugger on every line of\ncode one writes is simply inappropriate in a test first design.\n\nRegards,\n\nRob\n\n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nFind the one for you at Yahoo!
