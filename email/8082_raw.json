Downloading now. Thanks\n\nThere&#39;s a few other thingd in there as well.  Mike wrote a section on\nthem for my &quot;JUnit extensions&quot; chapter.  And I made use of the\nEqualsTester in the example.  It&#39;s very handy.\n \n&gt; I&#39;ve just pre-ordered your book on BN. Looking forward to reading \n&gt; it.\n\nThanks.  Just a note.. the BN site has the &quot;real&quot; cover, Amazon still\nhas an earlier version.\n\n&gt; I&#39;m currently delving into several XP books (Java Tools for Extreme \n&gt; Programming, as well as the Oreilly XP Cookbook)\n\nTo be honest, I haven&#39;t read those yet.  As you&#39;re looking at TDD, you\nshould read Kent&#39;s &quot;TDD: by Example&quot; as well.\n\n&gt; &gt; I suggest EasyMock (www.easymock.org) as well as\n&gt; &gt; MockObjects (http://www.mockobjects.com)\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks for the links. Got them bookmarked.\n\nIf anyone (else) on here is using Smalltalk, I have a dynamic\nMockObject framework ready for use (similar to EasyMock).\n \n&gt; Got a lot to learn about TDDing.\n\nWe all do.\n\n&gt; Sucks trying to learn this while attempting develop software with a \n&gt; deadline...\n\nYes, and the ironic thing is that once you get good at it, you&#39;ll find\nyourself working faster.\n\n&gt; Thanks for the tips, \n\nGlad to be of assistance.\n\n&gt; and I&#39;m sure this list will be hearing from me  again.\n\nGood.. that&#39;s what it&#39;s here for IMHO.\n\nDave\n\n\n",
