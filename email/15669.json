In my latest projects, I have a test suite<br/>\n&gt; &gt; that runs &quot;all fast tests&quot; in under a minute; very useful when just<br/>\n&gt; &gt; running one or two test cases doesn&#39;t cover all your changes.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; However, the build also runs completely independant on build machine<br/>\n&gt; &gt; via ant, which isn&#39;t very hard to do if you just get it working from<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the start.  So you can get the CI and all that brings with it, plus<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the feedback on a local developer&#39;s IDE before they check in.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I think that working on one object and one test at a time is enough. I<br/>\n&gt; suspect that the effort to create a suite for each object you work on<br/>\n&gt; would get tedious. If you&#39;re working on a highly connected object, it<br/>\n&gt; would be better to refactor it rather than cater to it.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Simon,<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m intrigued.  On many of my projects, I have a single suite of fast <br/>\ntests that cover all the classes in my project; no need for a suite for <br/>\neach class.  I find that this often allows me to catch accidental <br/>\ndependencies, and also allows me to have the structure of my tests not <br/>\nbe rigidly isomorphic to the structure of my code.  Would this strategy <br/>\nwork on your projects?<br/>\n<br/>\n    David Saff</div>",
