I want to make that decision in my test<br/>\nclass and not in the class that runs the suite.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think one time setup/teardown is appropriate when<br/>\nyou have a static set of data and you are testing<br/>\nmethods that read and write that data in a set way. <br/>\nFor my application, I&#39;m testing database mappings and<br/>\na thesarus used in converting individual values.  The<br/>\nsource data only needs to be loaded once, not for<br/>\nevery test.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn fact, the more I think about it, I would probably<br/>\nend up using one time setup/teardown a lot more than<br/>\nthe standard setup/teardown mechanism and it has<br/>\nnothing to do with how I&#39;ve factored my application. <br/>\nSo, having either an overloaded setUp/tearDown,<br/>\nseparate set of methods, or a tag interface to allow<br/>\none time setup/teardown makes a lot of sense to me.<br/>\n<br/>\nCurt<br/>\n---  &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jbase@...\">jbase@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; I have used one time setup and teardown when testing<br/>\n&gt; tools that work on directories and files.  I want a<br/>\n&gt; know set of directories and files (and for a backup<br/>\n&gt; tool the dates).  I don&#39;t see the value in<br/>\n&gt; setup/teardown for each unit test.  This assumes the<br/>\n&gt; tool/tests do not change the setup.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The only problem was &quot;tricking&quot; junit to allow this.<br/>\n&gt;  I could have done this in ant but sometimes, during<br/>\n&gt; developement I use jedit and junit and not ant.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I would like junit to support a onetime<br/>\n&gt; setup/teardown for some types of tools, although it<br/>\n&gt; is possible I would get lazy and use in when I<br/>\n&gt; shouldn&#39;t.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; jeb<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; _______________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; Can a Web portal forever change your life?<br/>\n&gt; Win up to $25 Million on iWon - <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.iwon.com\">http://www.iwon.com</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>__________________________________<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!
