My app is distributed and \nuses serialization to send java objects over the wire.  When I run my \ntests from within Forte they work fine.  When I run them from the \ncommand line I get a InvalidClassException stating the \nserialVersionUID of my class is 0, which doesn&#39;t match the receiving \nversion ID of the class.  The id of 0 makes me think that for some \nreason my serialized classes aren&#39;t being loaded properly.  For one \nthing I&#39;m defining the serialVersionUID myself and it&#39;s not 0.  \n&gt; \n&gt; My application seems to work perfectly except for the class version \nproblem so the classes are being loaded at least by the VM&#39;s default \nclass loader (and it works from within forte!?).\n&gt; \n\nI&#39;m guessing your computation of the serialVersionUID is based on all \ninstance variables, not just the non-transient ones.\n\nMike\n\n\n",
