If the system<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; is really that big, and test runs take hours, then I would immediately<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; evaluate the benefits of splitting that system into loosely coupled<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; parts and evolving them in separate source trees.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; You can run, but you can&#39;t hide :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You always find me...<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Eventually, any software that becomes reasonably complex takes time testing,<br/>\n&gt; and I don&#39;t think there is any way around that.  My experiences range from<br/>\n&gt; small software (TestNG - 300 tests, less than 10 seconds to run them all) to<br/>\n&gt; fairly large ones, where functional tests takes anywhere between five and<br/>\n&gt; ten hours (yes, 5 and 10).  Using groups in such systems is invaluable.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>If functional tests take 10 hours, then is it really one application? <br/>\nI&#39;m imagining that in 10 hours we can run 5,000 functional tests, and it <br/>\nseems to me that that&#39;s a large number for a system that can&#39;t <br/>\nreasonably be modularized into a few small projects. I would have <br/>\nprobably started considering that after the tests started taking 30 minutes.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Although I have to say that for such large scale software, the hurdle is<br/>\n&gt; usually much more the communication between the QA and the engineering teams<br/>\n&gt; than it is about test infrastructure, but every bit counts.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Indeed.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Agree, that&#39;s why groups called &quot;fast&quot; and &quot;slow&quot; make much more sense than<br/>\n&gt; &quot;unit&quot; and &quot;functional&quot;, in my opinion.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Absolutely. I tend to use &quot;fast&quot; and &quot;slow&quot;, knowing that isolated <br/>\nobject tests tend to be fast by their very nature, and slow tests tend <br/>\nto be integration/system/load/end-to-end.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Fair point.  It looks like in this particular case, your experience does not<br/>\n&gt; match mine and Jon&#39;s.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>That&#39;ll happen.<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJ. B.
