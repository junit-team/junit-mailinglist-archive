B. Rainsberger wrote:\n\n&gt; private is not the only way, nor necessarily the best way, to hide \n&gt; implementation details. I use interfaces instead.\n\nWith a lot of care this would work in some situations. If you made the \nclasses the that implemented the interfaces non-public, and provided \naccess to them through some sort of factory, it might work.  It&#39;s more \ncomplex but doable. You need to be careful not to expose the \nimplementation classes or people will use them in preference to the \ninterfaces, either deliberately or out of carelessness. If they write \ntheir own implementations then you&#39;re virtually guaranteed they&#39;ll code \nto the class rather than the interface. I see this all the time.\n\nThe real problem though is that Java is not designed to work this way. \nInterfaces are not meant to replace classes. In particular, the lack of \nmethod preconditions and postconditions means that you can no longer \nmake any promises about what a given method accepts or returns beyond \nthe simple return type. The reason we have access protection as a \nlanguage feature is because we cannot rely on programmer convention to \nenforce rules. Using interfaces instead of classes reduces us to using \nprogrammer convention to enforce constraints that should be enforced in \ncode. There are languages where preconditions and postconditions are \npart of the method signature, and in these languages, using interfaces \ninstead of classes is feasible. However, Java is not such a language. :-(\n\n-- \n﻿Elliotte Rusty Harold  elharo@...\nXML in a Nutshell 3rd Edition Just Published!\nhttp://www.cafeconleche.org/books/xian3/\nhttp://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0596007647/cafeaulaitA/ref=nosim\n\n",
