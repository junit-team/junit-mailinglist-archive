Years back I was a contractor for the DoD. This \n&gt; statement means one of a few possible things:\n&gt; \n&gt; 1. &quot;We don&#39;t know what jUnit it, so we&#39;re against it&quot;\n&gt; 2. &quot;We heard of something like jUnit that is actually banned, \n&gt; so just in case we&#39;ll say jUnit is banned too.&quot;\n&gt; 3. &quot;It&#39;s late, let&#39;s go home.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; I would suggest that since none of the people here who work \n&gt; with jUnit have heard of this ban, plus jUnit is pretty much \n&gt; the standard, the people making the claim must corroborate it \n&gt; to a *legally* binding degree. Nothing like a &quot;well I heard \n&gt; on the internet that...&quot; or &quot;some guy who works at some other \n&gt; location says...&quot; but a copy of an actual memo or directive \n&gt; that explicitly names jUnit and explains the reason for the ban.\n&gt; \n&gt; Otherwise, I would simply be a good negotiator, viz., \n&gt; expressions of sympathy (they are free) but don&#39;t give in to \n&gt; whatever they say until they document it.\n&gt; \n&gt; ---&gt; Exceptional claims require exceptional proof &lt;---\n&gt; \n&gt; Note that you should strongly take the position that jUnit is \n&gt; allowed, it is the standard and that *they* must prove their \n&gt; claim. Otherwise you will be trying to show a negative, which \n&gt; is impossible and will eat up a lot of your time in the \n&gt; process.  What will you do if you come up empty-handed and \n&gt; they say they think the memo was actually classified? \n&gt; If they are legitimate programmers then you&#39;ll get this \n&gt; settled pretty quickly and amicably. If they are \n&gt; non-technical but in charge, well... \n&gt; best of luck....\n&gt; \n&gt; Jeff\n&gt; \n&gt; David McReynolds wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Someone popped up at a meeting this morning and announced \n&gt; that the US\n&gt; &gt; DoD does not allow the use of jUnit for unit testing.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; First, I find\n&gt; &gt; that a little hard to swallow given the second statement about junit\n&gt; &gt; being the built-in testing generator provided by java (can you say\n&gt; &gt; non-sequitor?). Secondly, I cannot corroborate that \n&gt; statement via google.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; What I need is link to a document that explicitly corroborates or\n&gt; &gt; refutes the statement. So far, it looks like the statement is false\n&gt; &gt; but I am only using deductive reasoning there.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; Yahoo!
