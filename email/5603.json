I don&#39;t quite<br/>\nsee what your&#39;re driving at.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\n<br/>\nToby<br/>\n<br/>\nVladimir Bossicard wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; &gt; I want to test a library containing more than 1000 classes and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; lots of methods.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m sure you don&#39;t &#39;want&#39; but &#39;have to&#39; test this library :-)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Let&#39;s not mention that JUnit is primilarly entended for programmers and not QAs<br/>\n&gt; (no offense, I just want to say that if QAs are the ones starting to use JUnit,<br/>\n&gt; something&#39;s wrong in the project).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; In your place, I would go to your manager and expose the fact that testing<br/>\n&gt; 1,000 classes will take you months if not years.  If he wants to ship in two<br/>\n&gt; years, fine... but I bet it&#39;s not what he wants.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I can&#39;t imagine that the developers spend all their time writing code without<br/>\n&gt; some kind of testing.  Chances are that some test code has been written (just<br/>\n&gt; pray that developers haven&#39;t only used &#39;println&#39;) so try to reuse their code<br/>\n&gt; into JUnit tests and (even better) try to convince your manager to let the<br/>\n&gt; developers do this.  You can then run a code coverage tool to have a look where<br/>\n&gt; the code has not been tested.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; If you want to do negative testing (since it&#39;s a library, it must be pretty<br/>\n&gt; solid) JUnit may not be the best tool for this.  But you can write some<br/>\n&gt; extensions that test that a class is not crashing.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -Vladimir<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --<br/>\n&gt; Vladimir Bossicard<br/>\n&gt; www.bossicard.com<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\">junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
