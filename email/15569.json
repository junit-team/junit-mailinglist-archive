It is not that convincing, <br/>\nreally, but may add an additional confusion, like why those 9 tests were <br/>\nskipped and if that single failure in fact has any impact on any of 9 <br/>\nskipped cases.<br/>\n  With dependent tests we don&#39;t really talk about isolated unit tests <br/>\nbut rather about some integration tests when overall code coverage <br/>\nwithin given test case is going down when number of layers of the <br/>\nnon-directly tested code is increasing. So, it could be pretty much a <br/>\nbad smell...<br/>\n  BTW, for those haven&#39;t seen it yet, there is a nice rule enforcement <br/>\ntool for things like that called Ashcroft - <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://docs.codehaus.org/display/ASH/Home\">http://docs.codehaus.org/display/ASH/Home</a>   I believe it would nicely <br/>\nwork with TestNG too. ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\n  regards,<br/>\n  Eugene<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",
