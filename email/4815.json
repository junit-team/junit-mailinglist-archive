Olivier&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dolivier@...\">dolivier@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nwrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; The rule of thumb is that unit tests should be as<br/>\n&gt; standalone as possible, <br/>\n&gt; and dependencies on external resources such as<br/>\n&gt; databases or files should be <br/>\n&gt; minimized or eliminated.  This makes perfect sense. <br/>\n&gt; Tests which rely on <br/>\n&gt; external resources are  not self-contained, are<br/>\n&gt; harder to read, and can be <br/>\n&gt; broken even if the code is functioning correctly. <br/>\n&gt; However, code does touch <br/>\n&gt; external resources at some point.  Shouldn&#39;t this be<br/>\n&gt; tested, and how?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Specifically, I have code that parses a xml catalog<br/>\n&gt; file and builds a <br/>\n&gt; catalog object structure.  I want to verify that the<br/>\n&gt; parsing works <br/>\n&gt; correctly.  In particular, I want to make sure that<br/>\n&gt; it robustly handles <br/>\n&gt; unusual conditions such as catalogs with certain<br/>\n&gt; branches missing.  It <br/>\n&gt; seems to me that the simplest way to do this is to<br/>\n&gt; have a test which uses <br/>\n&gt; the parsing code to parse a very simple catalog and<br/>\n&gt; verifies that it builds <br/>\n&gt; what I expect it to.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; But to do this test I do need some external<br/>\n&gt; resource, a simple catalog <br/>\n&gt; file.  Ok.  Now I can&#39;t simply look at the test to<br/>\n&gt; see what it does.  I <br/>\n&gt; also have to look at the file.  Are there cleaner<br/>\n&gt; alternatives?  Must I <br/>\n&gt; simply accept that there will occasionally be<br/>\n&gt; external resources required <br/>\n&gt; to test functionality at the boundaries of the<br/>\n&gt; system?  If so, are there <br/>\n&gt; best practices for this scenario?  Am I missing<br/>\n&gt; something?  I&#39;d love to <br/>\n&gt; hear peoples thoughts.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; David Olivier<br/>\n&gt; Naval Research Laboratory<br/>\n&gt; Digital Mapping, Charting & Geodesy Analysis Program<br/>\n&gt; Code 7440.2<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!
