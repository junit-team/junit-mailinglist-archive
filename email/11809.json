But, with a little intention-revealing refactoring, I can convey <br/>\nthat after you *agitate SimpleMath.class you should get 100% coverage. I <br/>\nget the added bonus that most of the extracted methods and classes end <br/>\nup in a test harness that is re-usable.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI have found that this technique is rarely necessary for unit tests <br/>\nbecause the tests are so short anyway. But for higher level tests where <br/>\nthere is typically a lot of re-use it is very valuable.<br/>\n<br/>\nKevin<br/>\n<br/>\n* &#39;agitate&#39; is what our product does - so even if /you/ don&#39;t know what <br/>\nthat means (yet) our upper-management does.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nvalerie_abelin wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;&gt;I&#39;m not sure how to do that. Typically, the name of the test is enough <br/>\n&gt;&gt;to describe what each test means. Why is that not the case for you?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;d like to share the result of my unit testing with upper<br/>\n&gt; management-type people.  testInsertTooLargeValue() doesn&#39;t mean much<br/>\n&gt; to them.  I&#39;d like a prose description like:  &quot;In this test, we try<br/>\n&gt; inserting a value into the table that is too large.  Depending on such<br/>\n&gt; and such, this should occur.  Or if not, then this should occur.  In<br/>\n&gt; either case, the code finally handlings this use case in blah blah<br/>\n&gt; blah manner.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; Yahoo!
