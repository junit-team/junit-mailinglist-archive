I have a peculiar problem on similar lines.\nI have created test suites (say A,B,C ) and again added these to new test suite (say D)\nto make it a Regression Test Driver.\n\nWhen i run through junit ant task, all my Test classes (extending JFunc) are\ninstantiated and tests executed.\nHowever, the result with JUnit Report shows results of only test methods\nexecuted, and has no association from the original Test Class which it belongs to.\nIn short the presentation of report is such that all test methods(containing asserts)\nbelong to Test Class containing suite ( D as above) .\n\nAny Other Good idea to associated them to Test classes which they belong.\nI already know to\n1. Run Test Classes individually\n2. use Batchtest ant task\nto achive the desired result -- But NEED fresh idea.\n\nThanks\n\nRanjeet Sahay\n\n\n\n\n&quot;Tambascio, Larry&quot; wrote:\n\n&gt; Hey Nikunj,\n&gt;\n&gt; The junit Ant task can capture all the results in an XML file(s).  The\n&gt; junitreport ant task, I believe, does an XSL transformation of that XML.\n&gt; I&#39;m willing to bet that the XML file which has the results has enough\n&gt; information for you to do your processing.  You could write your own custom\n&gt; Ant task, based on junitreport if you like, to do the processing of the\n&gt; results you desire.  You could do your own XSL transformation, or you could\n&gt; simply parse through the file with some XML parser extracting that which you\n&gt; need.\n&gt;\n&gt; I would urge you to look at what the junit ant task outputs in the XML file.\n&gt; It captures results, so why rewrite it?  Sounds like you have some pretty\n&gt; specific things you want to do with the results, and what those are isn&#39;t\n&gt; exactly clear.\n&gt;\n&gt; Hope this helps,\n&gt; -Larry\n&gt;\n&gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; From: Nikunj Manocha [mailto:manochanikunj@...]\n&gt; Sent: Thursday, August 21, 2003 11:04 AM\n&gt; To: junit@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Subject: [junit] Parsing Junit test results\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi All,\n&gt;\n&gt;   My application needs the following:\n&gt;    1. Execute a suite of junit tests\n&gt;    2. Parse the results and identify certain critical test results\n&gt;    3. If the test pass, then carry forward with processing otherwise\n&gt; kill.\n&gt;\n&gt;   I am looking for ideas or applications that would allow me to parse\n&gt; the result. How could this best be done? Any ideas would be\n&gt; appreciated since I have never used this before and am looking for\n&gt; options to do this prasing. I am working with Ant scripts to execute\n&gt; JUnit on a Unix environment.\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanx for your help.\n&gt;\n&gt; Regards,\n&gt; Nikunj\n&gt;\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
