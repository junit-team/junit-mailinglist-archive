Oops.)<br/>\n<br/>\nWe hacked up an earlier version of JUnit to scan through all jar <br/>\nfiles in the classpath and run all found tests. Our solution required <br/>\nJDK 1.2, even though (for now) most of our developers are stuck on <br/>\nJDK 1.1 (we&#39;re hoping to move from MS J++ soon). <br/>\n<br/>\nObviously this is not good -- having our developers run against a <br/>\ndifferent JDK version than our tests. <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m trying to clean things up, so I&#39;m ripping out our custom hacks <br/>\nand upgrading to JUnit 3.5. I notice the new classpath scanning code <br/>\n(in ClassPathTestCollector et al), but also notice that the comments <br/>\nstate that JAR scanning is not implemented. <br/>\n<br/>\nI tried Duncan McGregor&#39;s ZipAwareLoadingTestRunner and haven&#39;t had <br/>\nany luck -- various class loading and null pointer problems (not in <br/>\nhis code). <br/>\n<br/>\nSo my question is: Has anyone managed to get JUnit to scan the <br/>\nclasspath and execute tests in all jar files using JDK 1.1? <br/>\n<br/>\nthanks in advance, <br/>\nSimon</div>",
