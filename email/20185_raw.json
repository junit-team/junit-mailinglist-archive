I learned that TDD is one best approach to address this\n&gt;  issue, but I still feel the root cause lies in re-factoring my code,\n&gt;  so the TDD isn&#39;t helping me much here. Can you suggest any links or\n&gt;  articles where I can find more details about re-factoring techniques ?\n&gt;\n&gt;  Thanks for your suggestion.\n&gt;\n&gt;  Sarat kumar.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;  --- In junit@yahoogroups.com, Kamlesh Kumar &lt;kamlesh.kumar@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; Hi edu_kumar,\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; You can injected your expected values to those private\n&gt;  &gt; variables using reflection from your testcase method.\n&gt;  &gt; Then your testcase should work properly.\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; Good Luk\n&gt;  &gt; Kamlesh Kumar\n&gt;  &gt; Insurance SBU, Pune.\n&gt;  &gt; L&T Infotech Ltd.\n&gt;  &gt; Tel: (O)(91)-20-6641 6262 ext. 6138\n&gt;  &gt; Email: kamlesh.kumar@...\n&gt;\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; Larsen & Toubro Infotech Ltd.\n&gt;  &gt; www.Lntinfotech.com\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; This Document is classified as:\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; L&T Infotech Proprietary L&T Infotech Confidential L&T Infotech\n&gt;  &gt; Internal Use Only L&T Infotech General Business\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; This Email may contain confidential or privileged information for the\n&gt;  &gt; intended recipient (s) If you are not the intended recipient, please do\n&gt;  &gt; not use or disseminate the information, notify the sender and delete it\n&gt;  &gt; from your system.\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; &quot;edu_kumar&quot; &lt;sarat.beesa@...&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;  &gt; Sent by: junit@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;  &gt; 12/21/2007 04:31 PM\n&gt;  &gt; Please respond to\n&gt;  &gt; junit@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; To\n&gt;  &gt; junit@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;  &gt; cc\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; Subject\n&gt;  &gt; [junit] Ideas for testing large methods..\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; Hi all,\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; I&#39;ve been stuck with a problem, when i&#39;m unit testing my code.\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; My problem is that i&#39;ve a really huge method,which calls several small\n&gt;  &gt; methods ( methods so small, they&#39;re just getters for member\n&gt;  &gt; variables), If i have to unit test this method, i&#39;ve to make sure all\n&gt;  &gt; the small methods that it subsequently invoke, work as they&#39;re\n&gt;  &gt; expected. But all my member variables get initialized seperately in a\n&gt;  &gt; different method which is of no relation with the BIG method I wanted\n&gt;  &gt; to test in the first place.\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; Can I test my method without worrying about the initialization of my\n&gt;  &gt; object&#39;s data, by mocking the results of all my getter methods ?\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; Ex:\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; Class MyClass\n&gt;  &gt; {\n&gt;  &gt; private Object _member;\n&gt;  &gt; public void initialize()\n&gt;  &gt; {\n&gt;  &gt; //huge initialization process, which initializes my member\n&gt;  &gt; variables.\n&gt;  &gt; _member = new Object();\n&gt;  &gt; }\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; public void myHugeMethod()\n&gt;  &gt; {\n&gt;  &gt; //.. my logic here.\n&gt;  &gt; Object m = getMember();\n&gt;  &gt; //... proceed with this value.\n&gt;  &gt; }\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; public Object getMember()\n&gt;  &gt; {\n&gt;  &gt; return this._member;\n&gt;  &gt; }\n&gt;  &gt; }\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; Now, if I call &#39;myHugeMethod()&#39; without calling &#39;initialize()&#39; method,\n&gt;  &gt; it always return NULL.\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; All i wanted to do is to test &#39;myHugeMethod()&#39;, by mocking\n&gt;  &gt; &#39;getMember()&#39; method and setting the result what i wanted.\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; I tried using Jmock for creating mocks in my test case, but it fails\n&gt;  &gt; because the mock object only knows what exactly I wanted to mock but\n&gt;  &gt; nothing more than that. All my application logic is present in\n&gt;  &gt; &#39;MyClass&#39; object not in its mock.\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; How can I achieve this using Jmock ?\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; FYI, I tried with a direct approach by extending &#39;MyClass&#39; and\n&gt;  &gt; overriding the &#39;getMember()&#39; method in it. But I still feel there&#39;s a\n&gt;  &gt; better way to do it.\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; I&#39;ll be very thankful for any help in this regard..\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; Thanks in advance,\n&gt;  &gt; Sarat kumar.\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; __________________________________________________________\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; __________________________________________________________\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n\n\n\n-- \nProgramming is the art of writing essays in crystal clear prose and\nmaking them execute. - Per Brinch Hansen\n\n",
