Three things \n&gt; have changed.\n&gt;   * The class is now annotated with a class used to run it: \n&gt; @Factory(Parameterized.class). This seems like a very general mechanism \n&gt; to me. For example, I was able to write a test runnerlet to run JUnit \n&gt; 3.x AllTests in a few minutes. Would JUnit extenders find this \n&gt; annotation generally helpful?\n&gt;   * The data comes from a static method instead of a static field. A \n&gt; method seemed more general than a field and is evaluated later, when the \n&gt; test is run instead of when the class is loaded. Totally static data can \n&gt; be simply implemented by a method which just returns that data.\n&gt;   * Parameters are passed to a constructor instead of stuffed into \n&gt; fields. This seems more general as well as reducing the number of \n&gt; annotations by one. One limitation of the current implementation is that \n&gt; parameterized test classes can only have a single constructor.\n\nI quite like this, Kent. It makes me happy to move my data-driven tests \nback from Fit RowFixtures into JUnit.\n\nTake care.\n-- \nJ. B.
