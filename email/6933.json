Just a thought.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Heck of a thought.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I would expect:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;    a) The class structure would contain the test methods, but they<br/>\n&gt; &gt;        wouldn&#39;t be loaded in the absence of a -test flag, or some<br/>\n&gt; such.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;    b) With the -test option present, a framework would exist to help<br/>\n&gt; you<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;         experiment with the APIs, uncovering gaps in the<br/>\n&gt; documentation.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;         (If I give an empty string as an argument, do I get a null<br/>\n&gt; &gt; String, an empty string, or an exception?)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Yes, both of these would be cool, especially if a reporting mechanism<br/>\n&gt; and<br/>\n&gt; driver was built-into the JVM.  Not likely, but it&#39;s not impossible.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;    c) API documentation would have a link to a page containing test<br/>\n&gt; &gt;        methods that would exist only if the class was testable.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Such a thing could be really cool, self-documenting addition to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; libraries.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; That is a pretty cool idea.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; What the heck *is* unit testing, anyway? If it is &quot;class methods&quot;,<br/>\n&gt; then<br/>\n&gt; &gt; JUnitDoclet made sense. But if it is &quot;basic operations&quot;, isn&#39;t that<br/>\n&gt; more<br/>\n&gt; &gt; like integration testing? Or is there a middle ground, say, as<br/>\n&gt; package-<br/>\n&gt; &gt; level operations?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Right now, I&#39;m seeing &quot;unit&quot; as one or more of:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   * method<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   * class<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   * package<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   * use case<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Are there any other candidates? Are any of these automatically<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ruled out? What exactly does the word &quot;unit&quot; mean, in this<br/>\n&gt; &gt; context?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I go by the Robert Binder definition, which is couched in a<br/>\n&gt; comprehensive<br/>\n&gt; thesis about the importance of identifying appropriate testing<br/>\n&gt; techniques<br/>\n&gt; and bug predictions for components at different scopes.  But the<br/>\n&gt; scopes used<br/>\n&gt; are traditional categories (in QA engineering, Boris Beizer and<br/>\n&gt; Gelnford<br/>\n&gt; Meyers pretty well represent the founders of tradition).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; From Binder&#39;s &quot;Testing Object-Oriented Systems,&quot; p. 45:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &quot;The scope of a test is the collection of software components to be<br/>\n&gt; verified. [...] Scope is traditionally designated as unit, integration<br/>\n&gt; or<br/>\n&gt; system.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &quot;The scope of a unit test typically comprises a relatively small<br/>\n&gt; executable.<br/>\n&gt; In object-oriented programming, an object of a class is the smallest<br/>\n&gt; executable unit, but test messages must be sent to a method, so we can<br/>\n&gt; speak<br/>\n&gt; of method scope testing.  A test unit may consist of a class, several<br/>\n&gt; related classes (a cluster), or an executable binary file.  Typically<br/>\n&gt; it is<br/>\n&gt; a cluster of interdependent classes.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; And, some gems from the chapter on &quot;Classes&quot; (chapter 10), p. 351:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Q: Why Test at Class Scope?<br/>\n&gt; A [edited for length]:<br/>\n&gt; - System-level testing cannot exercise components to the same degree<br/>\n&gt; as<br/>\n&gt; class scope testing.<br/>\n&gt; - Trying to exercise a class through its clients is usually like<br/>\n&gt; trying to<br/>\n&gt; pick up a dime with boxing gloves. [one of my favorite lines from<br/>\n&gt; Binder&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; book]<br/>\n&gt; - The longer the time between creation of a bug and its debut as a<br/>\n&gt; failure,<br/>\n&gt; the higher the cost of correction.<br/>\n&gt; - Effective class scope testing reduces schedule risk and improves<br/>\n&gt; productivity.<br/>\n&gt; - It is poor practice, at best, to foist testing on to developers of<br/>\n&gt; client<br/>\n&gt; classes.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Scott Stirling<br/>\n&gt; Framingham, MA<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\">junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
