It is optimized for Object Testing \n(similar to unit testing); however, it is just an assertion/test \nsuite/test runner tool. Use it whatever way makes you productive.\n\n&lt;snip /&gt;\n\n&gt; I guess that this is not unit testing because I&#39;m not testing a\n&gt; single method&#39;s actions.  \n\nDon&#39;t Test Methods; Test Behaviors. Somewhere, you have to invoke a \nsingle method that says &quot;Do XYZ.&quot; Test that method. In so doing, you \ndiscover that testing that method would be easier if it were decomposed \nlike so, and this responsibility were pushed over there... much easier. \nSo much the better: testing has improved your design.\n\n&gt; Is it inappropriate to use junit in this way?  Is there a better way?\n\nSerious question: why the #$%# do you care whether it is \n&quot;inappropriate&quot;? Does it get the job done?\n\nIf your question is &quot;Is there a better way?&quot; then that is another \ndiscussion entirely. I advise you to put all that out of your mind, \nwrite some tests, refactor, write some tests, refactor... let the pain \nbe your guide.\n\nTake care.\n-- \nJ. B.
