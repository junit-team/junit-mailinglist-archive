There is no value-add<br/>\n&gt; here.  Right?  No additional value to customers and no additional<br/>\n&gt; value to developers.  It is simply style.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Or, am I fundamentally missing something.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHere is how I pitch annotations for testing.<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst of all, putting &quot;test&quot; in front of a test method is really &quot;adding<br/>\nmetadata to that method&quot;.  You want to keep the method, but you are also<br/>\nadding information for a specific, and telling this tool that this method<br/>\nhas a specific status.  Now imagine that you want to do the same thing for,<br/>\nsay, a tool that will automatically generate RMI stubs, and suddenly your<br/>\nmethods need to be called &quot;testRemoteFoo()&quot;.  You can see where this leads.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe obvious place for this kind of information is in annotations.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis &quot;older&quot; way is also very intrusive:  it forces you to certain namings<br/>\n(methods start with &quot;test&quot;), certain structural constraints (&quot;have to extend<br/>\na given base class&quot;, which is a big deal in Java since we only have one shot<br/>\nat that) and also imposes you to a certain package hierarchy to keep track<br/>\nof what tests are and where (package test.db, test.gui, etc...).<br/>\n<br/>\nOnce you embrace annotations and, in the case of TestNG, test groups, you<br/>\nregain complete freedom to write your Java code the way you want.  In<br/>\neffect, your test classes look a lot more like simple Java code (if you<br/>\nremove the annotations).<br/>\n<br/>\nAdditionally, test groups (@Test(groups = {&quot;db&quot;, &quot;fast&quot;}) cleanly separate<br/>\nyour test structure from your Java structure.  You are free to put your<br/>\nclasses in whatever package you like, and you will specify their test<br/>\ncategory in these groups (additionally, test methods can belong to more than<br/>\none group, something you can&#39;t do if you&#39;re using package to organize your<br/>\ntests).<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nCédric<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed] </span></blockquote></div>",
