They dramatically reduce the time necessar=\r\ny to go\nfrom &quot;yeah, I&#39;m done&quot; to really deployable. One problem is that thi=\r\ns\ndebugging time is often not carefully accounted for so it seems I&#39;m takin=\r\ng\nlonger. Once I factor in the productivity I gain from not having all thos=\r\ne\ninterruptions, though, I can see that I&#39;m going faster.\n\nOne reason may b=\r\ne that writing the tests is overlapped with a lot of\nanalysis and design th=\r\ninking I would have to do anyway. I end up with\nanalysis, design, and tests=\r\n in roughly the same time it would have taken me\nto do the analysis and des=\r\nign without the tests. This only applies when I\nwrite tests first. Test-fir=\r\nst also neatly solves the &quot;we don&#39;t have time to\nwrite tests now that the c=\r\node is &#39;done&#39;&quot; problem.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nKent Beck\nThree Rivers Institute=\r\n\n\n&gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; From: junit@yahoogroups.com [mailto:junit@=\r\nyahoogroups.com] On \n&gt; Behalf Of C=E9dric Beust ? \n&gt; Sent: Thursday, Februa=\r\nry 09, 2006 2:53 PM\n&gt; To: junit@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Subject: Re: [junit] Is J=\r\nunit-based testing REALLY possible \n&gt; for commercial software development ?=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; Fascinating questions, Frank :-)\n&gt; \n&gt; A few thoughts.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;    - Wi=\r\nll thorough testing make the project take longer?  Of course it\n&gt;    will. =\r\n Either in time or in programmers.
