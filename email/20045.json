The<br/>\nresponse to Crap4J was so positive that we decided to go further and<br/>\ncreated a dedicated website crap4j.org &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.crap4j.org\">http://www.crap4j.org</a>&gt; .<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;ve had hundreds of downloads since we launched the site,  along with<br/>\nmany requests for Ant support and support for IDEs other than Eclipse.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe just added Ant support in 1.1.4, and we are planning to support other<br/>\nIDEs like NetBeans and IntelliJ (BTW, if you are interested in<br/>\ncontribute to plug-in development please let us know).<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you have a chance, please try Crap4J on your project and let us know<br/>\nwhat you think.  We are interested in getting this group&#39;s feedback on<br/>\nCrap4j and suggestions for improving and extending it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe home page is: www.crap4j.org &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.crap4j.org\">http://www.crap4j.org</a>&gt; ; from there<br/>\nyou can navigate to the download page.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you have any problems installing it or running it, feel free to ask<br/>\nfor help on the forum or file a bug report or feature request.<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://trac.crap4j.org/\">http://trac.crap4j.org/</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\n<br/>\nAlberto<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",
