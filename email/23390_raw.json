These \ntests are still executed and the result is inverted (a test error is \nreported as success because it is what is expected whereas a success is \nreported as error to indicate that the feature has been implemented). \nThe @NotYetImplemented tests appear with the suffix &quot;(NYI)&quot; in the \nreports but aren&#39;t counted differently.\n\nI&#39;ve proposed for some time to add such a feature in JUnit but the \nencountered enthusiasm was quite limited ;-)\n\nCheers,\nMarc\n-- \nHtmlUnit support & consulting from the source\nBlog: http://mguillem.wordpress.com\n\n\nLe 14/04/2011 21:26, lars.vonk a �crit :\n&gt; Hi,\n&gt;\n&gt; I would like to see progress in (acceptance) tests not yet implemented. I want these reported differently than normal failures. Is there a way in JUnit to distinct between expected failing tests and &quot;normal&quot; failing tests?\n&gt;\n&gt; So in a report I would like to see something like:\n&gt;\n&gt; Tests: 42\n&gt; Failures:0\n&gt; Errors: 0\n&gt; Ignored: 0\n&gt; To implement: 12\n&gt;\n&gt; Regards, Lars\n\n",
