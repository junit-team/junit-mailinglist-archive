By looking a=\r\nt their test code\nand\n&gt; comparing it to your code (which maybe isn&#39;t workin=\r\ng), you can get an\n&gt; idea\n&gt; where you or the vendor are making unwarranted =\r\nassumptions.\n&gt;\n&gt; On Mon, 12 Nov 2001, David Stagner wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Rogers, J=\r\nason&quot; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;David Stagner&quot; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; Unit tests docume=\r\nnt API usage very well, for starters.  And\nthey\n&gt; &gt; &gt; suggest\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; whe=\r\nre any bugs encountered might be, even by their absence (a\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; proble=\r\nmatic condition may not be tested, and a set of tests\n&gt; could\n&gt; &gt; &gt; rule\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; out a bunch of possible causes for a bug).\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Th=\r\nis seems like a pretty weak argument to me.  They only document\n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n set of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the API that the authors chose to test, and they only test to=\r\n the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; authors&#39;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; degrees of comfortability.  Truth be known, just =\r\nbecause JUnit is\nin\n&gt; use\n&gt; &gt; &gt; does\n&gt; &gt; &gt; not mean that the code is being =\r\ntested thoroughly.  Right?  You\nmay\n&gt; be\n&gt; &gt; &gt; right\n&gt; &gt; &gt; that it could sh=\r\now you what isn&#39;t tested, but not necessarily why.\n&gt; And\n&gt; &gt; &gt; it only\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; gives you a clue as to what is not tested and what is.  There may\n&gt; not b=\r\ne\n&gt; &gt; &gt; a one\n&gt; &gt; &gt; to one mapping of the public API to the tests.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nGranted.  I was assuming that the set of unit tests theoretically\n&gt; &gt; provi=\r\nded by our imaginary vendor (has anyone ever seen a non-open\n&gt; source\n&gt; &gt; v=\r\nendor do this?) would be reasonably thorough, complete, and\n&gt; &gt; representat=\r\nive.  If the unit tests don&#39;t exercise all the documented\n&gt; &gt; methods and b=\r\noundaries of the API, they&#39;re incomplete anyway.  The\n&gt; hard\n&gt; &gt; part comes=\r\n with testing coupling, interaction, and state changes\n&gt; between\n&gt; &gt; compon=\r\nents, where the non-trivial bugs often lurk.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; On a more philosophica=\r\nl level, i&#39;d suggest that most unit testing is\n&gt; &gt; either very useful, or m=\r\nostly useless, depending on the confidence\nof\n&gt; &gt; the programmer in the tes=\r\nting process.  Cowardly testing is a sign\nof\n&gt; a\n&gt; &gt; lack of confidence in =\r\nthe code.  Once a programmer gets in the habit\n&gt; of\n&gt; &gt; serious unit testin=\r\ng, the programmer will almost always be more\n&gt; &gt; confident in the code - an=\r\nd thus more likely to test thoroughly.\nGood\n&gt; &gt; unit testing is a self-rein=\r\nforcing feedback loop.  And if i were\ngiven\n&gt; a\n&gt; &gt; set of unit tests from =\r\na vendor that clearly did not thoroughly test\n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; public interface of=\r\n the software, i would immediately distrust the\n&gt; &gt; software in question.\n&gt;=\r\n &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n-- \nEric Vought\nChief Technical Officer - QLUE Consulting, Inc.\n\nev=\r\nought@... toll-free: 888-771-3538  RTP area: 919-816-9901\n\n\nYahoo!
