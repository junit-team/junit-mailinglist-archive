Why make the effort to\n&gt; create a protected method that more than likely will never be used or\n&gt; will be used so rarely it won&#39;t even pay back the complexity cost of the\n&gt; extra JavaDoc? Designing for subclassing is hard. It takes roughly three\n&gt; times as much effort as designing a final class, maybe more. Most \n&gt; non-final classes in the wild are fundamentally broken. Of course \n&gt; sometimes you do need subclasses, but don&#39;t go adding extension points\n&gt; willy-nilly until you&#39;re ready to design them properly, document them\n&gt; fully, consider their implications for other dependent methods, and do\n&gt; all the other hard work required to create a truly extensible class.\n&gt; Java erred by not making final the default, but there&#39;s no reason we\n&gt; have to repeat its mistakes.\n\nWell, OK, but what makes private automatically better than\nprotected? I have to put some word there. What harm does it do to\nsay protected, or even public?\n\nI answer that it depends a great deal on what the code is trying to\nbe. If a bunch of us are writing some application in XP style, then\nwhy not leave it wide open? No harm is likely to come from it.\n\nOn the other hand, if we&#39;re publishing a library, then more privacy\nand more thinking is probably called for.\n\nRon Jeffries\nwww.XProgramming.com\nRon gave me a good suggestion once. -- Carlton (banshee858)\n\n\n",
