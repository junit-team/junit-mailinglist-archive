I have to disagree with that the moral of my story is<br/>\n&quot;the importance of the IDE.&quot;  Sure, the right tool can make a<br/>\njob easier, but it wasnt&#39; THAT difficult to type it in.  If I&#39;d<br/>\nbeen doing a lot of stuff like that, I&#39;d have taken the javadoc<br/>\nHTML and edited it with a more powerful editor (vi) than the<br/>\none I was using (Kawa 3.51a).  The job didn&#39;t seem big enough<br/>\nto make that context switch.  It was just a PITA.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe reason I&#39;m disagreeing is that I&#39;m currently fighting VisualCafe<br/>\ntrying to get it to deploy a simple EJB to WebLogic.  I&#39;m sure that<br/>\nVisualCafe has a lot of power, but it also is quite complicate and<br/>\nit hides what it&#39;s doing. (At least, it&#39;s not clear to me.)  Tools<br/>\nthat automate stuff for you are no substitute for knowing what&#39;s<br/>\ngoing on.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat said, maybe I&#39;ll look into NetBeans.  I wonder if it&#39;ll be<br/>\nfast enough to run on my lapton (a 233MHz K6)?<br/>\n<br/>\n - George<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Steve Freeman [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:steve@...\">steve@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Friday, March 16, 2001 3:23 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [junit] Re: awkward mock objects<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess it&#39;s about time to announce our mock objects library at <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sourceforge.net/projects/mockobjects/.\">http://sourceforge.net/projects/mockobjects/.</a> We aren&#39;t quite ready, <br/>\nlargely because we haven&#39;t quite got the sourceforge infrastructure <br/>\nworking for us, but it&#39;s in the CVS repository. There&#39;s no doc, but <br/>\nthere are unit tests and a copy of our XP2000 paper.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe code includes our expectation library and mock implementations of <br/>\nthings like io, servlets, and jdbc. There&#39;s also a jar that provides <br/>\nsome fill-in classes so it can run in Java 1.1.x. Given it&#39;s raw <br/>\nstate, please be gentle with us ;-) <br/>\n<br/>\nInterestingly, one of the morals of this exercise is the importance <br/>\nof the IDE. Creating mock objects from an interface is actually quite <br/>\neasy if you&#39;ve got a tool, such as VisualAge or NetBeans, that will <br/>\nwrite the skeleton.<br/>\n<br/>\nSteve<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In junit@y..., &quot;Dinwiddie, George&quot; &lt;George.Dinwiddie@a...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; Speaking of mock objects, I needed to test some objects that <br/>\ninitialized<br/>\n&gt; themselves from a JDBC ResultSet.  Rather than generate a test <br/>\ntable and<br/>\n&gt; stuff data into it, I decided to create a MockResultSet.  Well, <br/>\nResultSet is<br/>\n&gt; an interface with a LOT of methods.  What a boring chore this <br/>\nturned out to<br/>\n&gt; be.  In the end, I created an AbstractMockResultSet class that <br/>\nthrows an<br/>\n&gt; SQLException for every method.  If anyone needs such a thing, let <br/>\nme know<br/>\n&gt; and it could save you a lot of typing.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nTo unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\">junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nYour use of Yahoo!
