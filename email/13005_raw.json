I know the issues, and I&#39;m not\n&gt;  &gt; trying to force you to type too much.\n&gt; \n&gt; Oh, I&#39;m not offended or anything of the sort.  I&#39;m just chuckling that\n&gt; you and I specifically have discussed this issue before.  I&#39;m a quick\n&gt; typist, and I ought to be: I have all this practice from documenting\n&gt; my test methods and assert statements!  :)\n\nJust checking.\n\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; Just like the test name often needs further clarification (never pass\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; up an oportunity for documentation), often the reason for the\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; assertion is not self-apparent.  You can try to argue that &quot;it ought\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; to be, or rewrite your code!&quot; but, as before, I think you&#39;re straying\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; too close to the &quot;Java code is self-documenting&quot; argument, which I\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; find ... dubious at best.\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; I don&#39;t know. I just wrote this in an XHTMLUnit test today:\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; assertXpathExists(\n&gt;  &gt;      somewhereThereIsA(formNamed(&quot;demographics&quot;))\n&gt;  &gt;      .eventuallyContainingA(textFieldNamed(&quot;firstName&quot;)), document);\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; This translated to the XPath expression\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt;      //form[@name=&quot;demographics&quot;]//input[@type=&quot;text&quot; and \n&gt; @name=&quot;firstName&quot;]\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; Is a comment or a failure message going to make that clearer?\n&gt; \n&gt; I haven&#39;t had a need for XHTMLUnit, I&#39;m mostly commenting about\n&gt; vanilla JUnit usage.  That said, what message does the above generate\n&gt; in your error report?\n\nRoughly speaking:\n\nUnable to find xpath: //form[@name=&quot;demographics&quot;]//input[@type=&quot;text&quot; \nand @name=&quot;firstName&quot;]\n\nI realize now that you were aiming for being able to read failure \nmessages and not code, so my example is inappropriate.\n\n&gt;  &gt; I agree and explain &quot;why&quot; in English, but nost of the time, test case\n&gt;  &gt; class name, method name and line number is enough for me to know what\n&gt;  &gt; failed, from which I generally can determine why it failed. If not, then\n&gt;  &gt; my tests are too big (and that&#39;s an entirely different problem).\n&gt; \n&gt; Do you have the same experience with tests you&#39;re not the author of?\n&gt; This is where I&#39;ve found it especially helpful, or frustrating if it\n&gt; doesn&#39;t exist.  Of course *my* logic and reasoning is always obvious,\n&gt; it&#39;s those other punks that write stuff I can&#39;t understand.\n&gt; (sarcasm!)\n\nIt depends on the size and scope of each test. I am working with a team \nthat has decided it will not write a single integration test until it \nreceives a defect report. Until then, it will test each object in \nperfect isolation from the others. I suspect they&#39;ll get an entire \nrelease done before they need to do something different.\n\n&gt; These additional comments have also been helpful if I&#39;m debugging a\n&gt; section I neither wrote, nor studied the original requirements.  An\n&gt; example of that situation is code written for features implemented\n&gt; before I joined the proeject.\n\nI don&#39;t doubt they&#39;re helpful, but I would have problems being on a \nproject and being told, &quot;Thou shalt write failure messages for each \nassertion.&quot; I think my productivity would go down 30% and I&#39;d probably \nstart looking for other work. It felt liike you wanted to institute such \na rule on a project. I merely pointed out that perhaps that strategy, \nthough safe, is quite less than optimal.\n-- \nJ. B.
