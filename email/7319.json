DbC provides <br/>\nmechanism to write pre/post conditions in terms of special Javadoc <br/>\ncomments.<br/>\n<br/>\n  iContract is a tool which is used to verify code for Design by <br/>\nContract.<br/>\n<br/>\n  iContract takes Java code with special pre/post condition Javadoc <br/>\ncomments. It generates Java code having pre-processed code for <br/>\nspecified pre/post conditions. <br/>\n<br/>\n  Errors are will be thrown at runtime after preprocessed code is <br/>\nexecuted alongwith Java code.<br/>\n<br/>\n  My questions are :<br/>\n  How to test the pre-processor code generated by iContract ?<br/>\n  What will be the related concerns in testing ?<br/>\n<br/>\n  Waiting for response...<br/>\n<br/>\nRegards,<br/>\n--- Shivprasad Mangesh Bhide</div>",
