I\n&gt; would like to release my program under the GPL license.  The GPL is\n&gt; not compatible with JUnit&#39;s CPL license, but the Free Software\n&gt; Foundation have told me that I can insert an exception into my GPL to\n&gt; allow linking against CPLed libraries.  However, they warned me that I\n&gt; might still be violating the CPL if I do this.\n\nYou need to get clear in your head who is licensing what.\n\nIf you release code including JUnit code, then the JUnit license\napplies to the JUnit code and your license applies to your own code.\nYou cannot change the terms of the JUnit license.  You have no right\nto do so.\n\n&gt; So, can I link my GPLed program against JUnit?  If not I will have to\n&gt; strip out all the tests before I release.\n\nAfter a quick review of the JUnit license, I would say that you can\ninclude the code but must identify it as JUnit code and state that that\npart of the software is released under the JUnit license, which you\nshould supply a copy of.\n\n--\nJim Dixon  jdd@...   tel +44 117 982 0786  mobile +44 797 373 7881\n\n\n",
