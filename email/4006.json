In other words, the behavior<br/>\nof derived types must remain unchanged from the client&#39;s perspective.  The<br/>\nconsequences of violating LSP are that clients must know all the derivatives<br/>\nof a base class.  These clients must then be modified when a new subclass is<br/>\ncreated.  Adhering to LSP allows clients to remain open to extension, but<br/>\nclosed to modification, when a new subclass is introduced.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn a separate note, I&#39;m not sure I would preclude concrete test classes from<br/>\noverriding setUp() or tearDown().  Test fixtures are fundamental building<br/>\nblocks of JUnit tests.  If in fact a concrete test forgets to call<br/>\nsuper.setUp() in its overridden setUp(), then the test will fail anyway.  The<br/>\nadvantages of adding to the fixture for concrete tests seems to outweigh the<br/>\npotential for abuse, in my opinion.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for sharing this article!<br/>\n<br/>\nRegards,<br/>\n<br/>\nMike<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nMike Clark<br/>\nClarkware Consulting, Inc.<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.clarkware.com\">http://www.clarkware.com</a><br/>\n720.851.2014</div>",
