The basic idea is to maximize reuse of tests\n&gt; written for an interface for every implementation of the interface.\n&gt;\n&gt; I have been using this technique for a while to good effect, but I would\n&gt; love to to get some feedback from this group on the issue.  I am\n&gt; especially interested to hear about other approaches that people have\n&gt; used to accomplish the same goals.\n&gt;\n&gt; Read the full article here\n&gt; http://www.placebosoft.com/abstract-test.html\n&gt;\n\nGreat article, Eric!\n\nUsing this testing pattern effectively identifies any violations of the\nLiskov Substitution Principle, which states that derived types must be\ncompletely substitutable for their base types.  In other words, the behavior\nof derived types must remain unchanged from the client&#39;s perspective.  The\nconsequences of violating LSP are that clients must know all the derivatives\nof a base class.  These clients must then be modified when a new subclass is\ncreated.  Adhering to LSP allows clients to remain open to extension, but\nclosed to modification, when a new subclass is introduced.\n\nOn a separate note, I&#39;m not sure I would preclude concrete test classes from\noverriding setUp() or tearDown().  Test fixtures are fundamental building\nblocks of JUnit tests.  If in fact a concrete test forgets to call\nsuper.setUp() in its overridden setUp(), then the test will fail anyway.  The\nadvantages of adding to the fixture for concrete tests seems to outweigh the\npotential for abuse, in my opinion.\n\nThanks for sharing this article!\n\nRegards,\n\nMike\n\n--\nMike Clark\nClarkware Consulting, Inc.\nhttp://www.clarkware.com\n720.851.2014\n\n\n\n",
