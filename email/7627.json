If so, mock out your database connection logic (the object that<br/>\nwould return you a java.sql.ResultSet) and have it return mock result<br/>\nsets from which you can create your business objects.  Any IDE worth its<br/>\nsalt should be able to stub the &#39;million and one&#39; methods in ResultSet<br/>\n-- then you simply implement the ones you want.  How you create those<br/>\nMockResultSet&#39;s is another story.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have some code for doing it, but I don&#39;t know if I can release it to<br/>\nthe public (I am a contractor on this project).  If so, I will do it<br/>\nsoon, if not I will see if I have time to mock one up and share it with<br/>\nthe group (perhaps Junit-Addons?).  The basic idea we have here for<br/>\ncreating our MockResultSet&#39;s is to create them with column names and<br/>\nvalues.  They can be single-row or multi-row sets.  Basically, we<br/>\nimplemented the navigation methods that we needed (i.e. next()) and the<br/>\ngetXYZ() methods that we needed (i.e. getString(...), getInt(...),<br/>\ngetLong(...), getDate(...)).<br/>\n<br/>\nHope that helps.<br/>\n=jason</div>",
