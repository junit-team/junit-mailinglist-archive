Then possibly refactored the derive <br/>\nclass to call the base class method, then further refactored the derived <br/>\nclass to remove the overridden method, seeing as it now does nothing.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, after all of this, I&#39;m still testing the public interface of <br/>\nthe derived class.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen if the derived class is refactored again to do something additional <br/>\nto the super class, our existing test will let know if anything is <br/>\nbroken. Also, if we refactor the super class because of some need of <br/>\nanother derived class, we know whether we have broken any derived <br/>\nclasses assumptions of how the super class works.</div>",
