I have posted such a tool\nthat was written to work with VAJ.  It wouldn&#39;t be a difficult task to make\nit work with a file system as well.

I \n    &gt; want to do a\n    &gt; static analyst of the code to check which classes and \n    &gt; methods have tests.\n    &gt; Think of it as Lint for Junit - Jint perhaps :-)\n    &gt; \n    &gt; John \n    &gt; \n    &gt; -----Original Message-----\n    &gt; From: Michael Silverstein\n    &gt; To: junit@yahoogroups.com\n    &gt; Sent: 6/25/01 9:05 PM\n    &gt; Subject: RE: [junit] Test coverage metrics reporting tool\n    &gt; \n    &gt; With Test Mentor (which among other things discovers and \n    &gt; runs JUnit\n    &gt; tests)\n    &gt; we use the JPDA http://java.sun.com/products/jpda/ to dynamically\n    &gt; monitor\n    &gt; method entry events during test execution.

(I&#39;m sure someone\n    &gt; &gt; has.)   What I\n    &gt; &gt; what to do is generate a report that shows some stats \n    &gt; on how many\n    &gt; classes\n    &gt; &gt; have test cases and how many methods in the class under \n    &gt; test have\n    &gt; &gt; corresponding test methods.  I have tried it a few \n    &gt; different ways:\n    &gt; &gt;\n    &gt; &gt; 1. Just scanning through the source folder, picking up \n    &gt; the java files\n    &gt; and\n    &gt; &gt; then checking if a ?Test.java file exists in a \n    &gt; corresponding unit test\n    &gt; &gt; folder.\n    &gt; &gt;\n    &gt; &gt; This approach works well if I only cared about the file \n    &gt; coverage,\n    &gt; &gt; but I now\n    &gt; &gt; want info on the method coverage.  Enter method 2.\n    &gt; &gt;\n    &gt; &gt; 2. Use a tool that will parse through the java source \n    &gt; and tell me all\n    &gt; the\n    &gt; &gt; methods. I used javadoc for this, but the problem with \n    &gt; it is that\n    &gt; &gt; I can only\n    &gt; &gt; sort through one source structure at a time, and \n    &gt; javadoc is not so\n    &gt; nice to\n    &gt; &gt; call programmatically (it shuts down your app after it \n    &gt; runs once).\n    &gt; &gt;\n    &gt; &gt; If anyone has suggestions on a better was to get info \n    &gt; on the methods\n    &gt; in a\n    &gt; &gt; class, and other information like is the class an interface, I\n    &gt; &gt; would love to\n    &gt; &gt; hear it.  Or better yet, if anyone has seen or built a tool\n    &gt; &gt; similar to what\n    &gt; &gt; I&#39;m doing I would also love to hear about it.\n    &gt; &gt;\n    &gt; &gt; Thanks,\n    &gt; &gt;\n    &gt; &gt; John\n    &gt; &gt;\n    &gt; &gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n    &gt; &gt; junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n    &gt; &gt;\n    &gt; &gt;\n    &gt; &gt; Your use of Yahoo!
