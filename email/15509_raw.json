As a very concrete example of this probl=\r\nem, I can see great\nbenefits in using parameterised tests (more on that in =\r\nanother mail) but\nI could easily want to use them in conjunction with\n@Befo=\r\nreClass/@AfterClass (whether another &quot;level&quot; of setup/teardown,\ntaking plac=\r\ne after all the tests for a particular parameter set would be\ngood or not i=\r\ns an open question in my mind). Additionally, I can see\nthere potentially b=\r\neing other extensions which I&#39;d want to use in\nconjunction with each other.=\r\n\n\nI can&#39;t see a neat way round this without being prescriptive about the\nki=\r\nnds of extensions which are available (at which point you could chain\ncerta=\r\nin types together - introspectors which found or removed possible\ntests, fo=\r\nr example). I thought I&#39;d raise it as a concern though. (I\nadmit I&#39;m less c=\r\noncerned than I was before I saw that @Before, @After,\nexpected exceptions =\r\nand timed tests are all handled by TestMethodRunner\nrather than TestClassRu=\r\nnner.)\n\nAny thoughts?\n\nJon Skeet\nSenior Software Engineer\nCLEARSWIFT\nThe MI=\r\nMEsweeper Company\n\nDDI:               +44 (0) 1189  038  109\nMobile:       =\r\n    +44 (0) 7970 158 865\nSwitchboard:   +44 (0) 1189  038  903 \nFax:       =\r\n        +44 (0) 1189  039  000      \nWeb: www.clearswift.com \n\n\n\nClearswift=\r\n monitors, controls and protects all its messaging traffic in compliance wi=\r\nth its corporate email policy using Clearswift products.\nFind out more abou=\r\nt Clearswift, its solutions and services at http://www.clearswift.com\n\nThis=\r\n communication is confidential and may contain privileged information inten=\r\nded solely for the named addressee(s).
