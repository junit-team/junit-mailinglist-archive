Changing too much jeopardizes stableness.\n&gt; \n&gt; The major complains users have do not target the framework but the swing\n&gt; or text interface.  Adding functionalities like &quot;managing the non-loaded\n&gt; classes&quot; via properties do not add (too much) complexity to the\n&gt; framework.\nright.\n\n&gt; Share your work!  If you write things you thing is really interesting,\n&gt; share it!  Don&#39;t expect 2-3 people to have the solution for every\n&gt; problem you encounter :-)\n\nI share my work - but as an extension to JUnit. That was my point.\n\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; That&#39;s why I&#39;d rather have JUnit as a core with hooks to plug in\n&gt; &gt; additional behaviour which is available in additional tools.\n&gt; \n&gt; I partially agree.  If you have too many additional tools to run a\n&gt; program, you will have conflicts with versions.  I think that JUnit must\n&gt; have a framework, a swing interface and a text interface.\n&gt; \n&gt; I proposed the architecture of &quot;plug-in&quot; modules that will enable other\n&gt; programmers to write specific &quot;TestResult&quot; modules (using XML,\n&gt; databases, mail to store the results).  This won&#39;t add complexity to\n&gt; JUnit and allow a great flexibility.\n\nThe plug-in architecture sounds very good to me. I&#39;m looking forward to\nit.\n\nJohannes\n\n",
