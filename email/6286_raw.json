AllTests at the top of the tree \n&gt;&gt;has to know about all the tests or testsuites below it.\n&gt;&gt;[...] This seems to introduce cycles in Java packages [...]\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Is there a problem with having such cycles?\n\nGlad you asked. Normally I&#39;d say yes - you don&#39;t want cycles in an \nobject graph. In this case I&#39;m not so sure it&#39;s a problem, because \nit might just be my own private definition of what clean code looks \nlike and Java seems more forgiving than C++ wrt cycles. And I&#39;m \npretty sure Gamma and Beck and the legion of developers that use and \nextend JUnit know about dependency cycles. All of which are why I&#39;m \nafter opinions - I don&#39;t get what&#39;s special about JUnit that would \nabsolve it of this matter.\n\nThe solution for me was to stop using suites, invent a marker \ninterface and have a treewalker load classes that met the interface, \nbut that&#39;s inefficient. Another option is to follow a naming \nconvention and collate the tests that way - this does stop you \nloading up classes twice, but has the disadvantage of being a \nconvention as opposed to being something actually enforceable in the \nlanguage (imo it&#39;s not much better than an ide depending on magic \ncomments).\n\nBob Martin has a section in his new book on this subject, which is \nwhy I&#39;ve thinking about it again. Cycles are to be avoided, and one \nanswer he proposes is to apply a dependency inversion to the code. \nIn Junit I think you could make this happen in Junit by allowing \nTestCases to be visted by TestSuites. That would keep the \ndependencies unidirectional with the bonus of not having constantly \ngo to back the suite and add the test cases to it, which seems to be \nthe main reason people write a test collecting treewalker - this way \nyou&#39;d just add the suite to the test instead which is where you \nhappen to be in the code.\n\nBill de h�ra\n\n\n\n\n\n",
