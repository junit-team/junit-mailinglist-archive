Do you use Ant to combine the tests? Or another\n&gt; technique?\n\nI responded to Cedric&#39;s post. As always, you may or may not find it \ninteresting. Here&#39;s my response:\n\n--------------\nI almost always just run all my tests, avoiding the problem altogether. \nBy using Eclipse or  or IntelliJ IDEA or DirectorySuiteBuilder... I can \nsimply point to a location on disk and run all the tests contained in \nthat file system tree.\n\nIf I want to /permanently/ separate tests from one another -- for \nexample, slow-running ones from quick-running ones -- then I put them in \nseparate source trees. This makes it very easy to run all the \nslow-running tests in the background with CruiseControl, and run all the \nquick-running tests as part of my normal TDD cycle. Of course, I want to \nmove tests from the slow-running tree to the quick-running tree, because \nrunning more tests (all things being equal) is better.\n\nAfter that, there are only two reasons I use suite(): (1) for the \nParameterized Test Case pattern, (2) to create a temporary view of the \ntests while dealing with a specific problem, such as a defect.\n\nThe Parameterized Test Case needs suite() to generate tests with \nexternal fixture data, a pattern I describe in detail in _JUnit \nRecipes_, recipe 4.8. I do this more and more rarely, preferring to use \nFit instead.\n\nAs for dealing with a defect, the idea is to create a suite of tests \nthat likely expose the defect and cover the surrounding area, including \nany end-to-end tests (if needed). I have found myself doing this only a \nfew times, since TDD tends to stop me from making those kinds of \nmistakes. (I make other, more interesting mistakes, but that&#39;s not on \npoint for now.)\n\nThese are the techniques and strategies I use to make suite() -- such as \nused in an AllTests class -- essentially obsolete.\n\n[Please note that, when working on legacy code, I use OrderedTestSuite \nwith suite() to tease apart tests that rely on executing in a given \norder. I just don&#39;t work on much legacy code these days, so it&#39;s easy \nfor me to forget.]\n-- \nJ. B.
