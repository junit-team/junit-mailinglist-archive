Why would you<br/>\n&gt; want to do this?  One of the strengths of the<br/>\n&gt; framework (IMHO) is the<br/>\n&gt; guidance it gives me to fix every test<br/>\n&gt; incrementally.  I am unclear on why<br/>\n&gt; you would want the test to go on.  It seems to me<br/>\n&gt; that you would end up<br/>\n&gt; biting off more than you can chew.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;     &gt; Hi,<br/>\n&gt;     &gt; <br/>\n&gt;     &gt; When I run my test suite I found that each<br/>\n&gt; test stops <br/>\n&gt;     &gt; running after the<br/>\n&gt;     &gt; first failed assertion. I have a number of<br/>\n&gt; assertions in <br/>\n&gt;     &gt; each test and I<br/>\n&gt;     &gt; would like to know every assertion that is<br/>\n&gt; broken. I have tried to<br/>\n&gt;     &gt; create a default TestResult inside each test<br/>\n&gt; using,<br/>\n&gt;     &gt; <br/>\n&gt;     &gt; \tTestResult result = createResult();<br/>\n&gt;     &gt; <br/>\n&gt;     &gt; and then adding failures to &#39;result&#39; using,<br/>\n&gt;     &gt; <br/>\n&gt;     &gt; \tresult.addFailure(mytest, afe);<br/>\n&gt;     &gt; <br/>\n&gt;     &gt; which works fine, except that no<br/>\n&gt; AssertionFailedException <br/>\n&gt;     &gt; gets thrown<br/>\n&gt;     &gt; this way and my test passes even though I have<br/>\n&gt; broken assertions.<br/>\n&gt;     &gt; <br/>\n&gt;     &gt; Is there any way I can get JUnit to show all<br/>\n&gt; broken <br/>\n&gt;     &gt; assertions for each<br/>\n&gt;     &gt; test and not move onto the next test when the<br/>\n&gt; first <br/>\n&gt;     &gt; assertion fails?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nMake international calls for as low as $.04/minute with Yahoo!
