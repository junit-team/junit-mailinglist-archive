The solution was to have a\nclasspath that looked like:\n$JUNIT_HOME:$JUNIT_HOME/junit.jar\nwhich was embarrassingly obvious once I stopped to think about it.\n\nHowever, the problem in Redhat 8 existed for an apparently different\nreason.  The local Linux expert believes that there is an error in\nthe C library called.  This error showed up in jdb, so it may be\na problem for the developer list.\n\n\n&gt;  I too have a\n&gt; classpath problem that I cannot figure out.  I am running builds\nwith ant\n&gt; and have a junit target.\n[snip]\n&gt; Does the line &quot;[junit] Running test.myco.tsr.AllTests&quot; mean that it\nfound\n&gt; my test cases?  The error indicates the opposite.\n\n\nI don&#39;t know, but I will try setting up a similar ant project and\nI will try to reproduce the behavior.\n\nIs it possible that it found one of the classes needed for AllTests\nbut could not find the others?  I suspect that&#39;s what&#39;s happening.\n\nIt is interesting to note that even with the wrong path, in \nRedhat 9, I got something similar to your case -- I could get the\nswingui to run, but it could not find some or all of the test\nclasses needed.\n\nI believe your problem is similar to that Redhat problem.  I will\ntry to use ant to produce more definite data.\n\n\n\n&gt; \n&gt; Is your setup bombing because it can&#39;t find junit.jar or your test\n&gt; class(es)?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\nI believe the first bomb was because it didn&#39;t have both of the\nelements it needed.  In Redhat 9 it works if given\n$JUNIT_HOME:$JUNIT_HOME/junit.jar\n\nwhereas if memory serves, in Redhat 8 it didn&#39;t even work with\nthat classpath -- it bombed on a line of code where Java tried to\ncall a system-level command and failed.\n\nThe first element $JUNIT_HOME is what allows it to find the test\nclasses.  I suspect that might be what is missing in your case.\n\nAt first glance, this kind of classpath seems inefficient to me.\nHowever, it may be that the designers liked it.\n\nI will keep you posted as I learn more.\n\n\n\n",
