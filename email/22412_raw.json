We don&#39;t seem to have \nany special name for the latte=\r\nr. I use the term test case for\nthe combination of a test (set of predicate=\r\ns) with a single\nset of parameters to which it is applied.\n\nIn theory &lt;g&gt; T=\r\nheories could also introduce data internally, but\nthis doesn&#39;t seem very pr=\r\nactical. So theories are parameterized\nin practice, if not by nature. This =\r\ntends to make them look like\nparameterized tests when viewed from outside.\n=\r\n\nAnd of course, the implementation of a parameterized test in \nan xUnit-sty=\r\nle is typically a method with arguments. The \nimplementation of a Theory is=\r\n also a method with arguments. Again,\nthis makes them look like the same th=\r\ning - or as if a Theory\nis a specialization of a parameterized test.\n\nI don=\r\n&#39;t think that&#39;s the case. Or at least I don&#39;t think it&#39;s\nthe most useful wa=\r\ny to view things.\n\nDr. Who looks human, but he has two hearts. Those two se=\r\nts of \npredicates at the heart of a Theory are what make it what it is.\nWe =\r\ncould say - in either case - that the doctor/theory is a \nsubset of humans/=\r\nparameterized-tests, with the addition of\nsome extra functionality, but thi=\r\ns only makes sense at a very\nsuperficial level.\n\nUse parameterized tests if=\r\n you have a set of examples you need\nto make work. Use Theories... well... =\r\nif you have a theory that\nneeds to be demonstrated. In some kinds of work, =\r\nwe start with\na theory. In other kinds, we start with examples and have to\n=\r\nwork our way toward a mental model. IME, the former is more\ntypical in impl=\r\nementing algorithms while the latter is more\ntypical of business programmin=\r\ng. Also IME, premature speculation \nabout the underlying theory/model, rath=\r\ner than just listening to\nthe customer, is a pretty common anti-pattern.\n\nF=\r\nair warning: what I know about Theories is based on my\ninterpretation of so=\r\nme of David&#39;s papers and my efforts\nto implement it in NUnit, where it (a) =\r\nworks pretty well\nand (b) is poorly understood by most users. I&#39;m generally=\r\n \nfamiliar with how the JUnit implementation works, but I \ndon&#39;t know all t=\r\nhe intimate details.\n\nCharlie\n \n&gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; From: junit@=\r\nyahoogroups.com [mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com] On \n&gt; Behalf Of Berin\n&gt; Sent=\r\n: Friday, February 12, 2010 3:08 PM\n&gt; To: junit@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Subject: =\r\n[junit] Re: When to use parameterized tests vs. theories?\n&gt; \n&gt; My basic und=\r\nerstanding of the _practical_ difference between \n&gt; them is that parameteri=\r\nzed tests have more restrictions on \n&gt; how the data is set up.  For example=\r\n, parameterized tests \n&gt; have an array of arrays, each internal array is a =\r\nset of \n&gt; parameters to apply to the test.  Essentially, there is more \n&gt; o=\r\nnus on the test writer to know what parameters are important \n&gt; to test, an=\r\nd how they are supposed to relate.\n&gt; \n&gt; Theories have much less restriction=\r\ns on the data, and instead \n&gt; force the test writer to focus on the functio=\r\nn of the theory \n&gt; independent of the data.  That&#39;s a good thing IMO.\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\nMy guess is that parameterized tests came first, and because \n&gt; of the limi=\r\ntations it forced on the test writer theories came \n&gt; later.  That is only =\r\na guess.\n&gt; \n&gt; In some ways I would like to pair the expected result with \n&gt;=\r\n the passed in parameter, but that solution requires a \n&gt; parameterized tes=\r\nt.  In most applications, I care more about \n&gt; the behavior of a class impl=\r\nementing an interface, or \n&gt; something of that nature.\n&gt; \n&gt; What I&#39;m missin=\r\ng here is what is the _philosophical_ difference?\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In junit@yahoogr=\r\noups.com, C=C3=A9dric Beust =E2=99&quot; &lt;cbeust@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; If my under=\r\nstanding is correct, there is definitely an \n&gt; overlap between \n&gt; &gt; paramet=\r\nerized tests and theories.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Theories generate a set of tuples repre=\r\nsenting the combination of a \n&gt; &gt; data set, while parameterized can return.=\r\n.. well, any data \n&gt; set.  From \n&gt; &gt; that angle, theories are a subset of p=\r\narameterized tests, \n&gt; and as such, \n&gt; &gt; might have been better off impleme=\r\nnted as a utility function rather \n&gt; &gt; than a full fledged feature.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; --\n&gt; &gt; Cedric\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; On Fri, Feb 12, 2010 at 11:12 AM, Lorits=\r\nch, Berin C. &lt; \n&gt; &gt; berin.loritsch@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I kno=\r\nw I&#39;m a little slow on the uptake, but I&#39;m asking these \n&gt; &gt; &gt; questions so=\r\n that I can formulate how I&#39;m going to mentor \n&gt; my team to \n&gt; &gt; &gt; make the=\r\n most of their testing investment.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; There is a certain amount of=\r\n overlap between \n&gt; parameterized tests and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; theories. The parameteri=\r\nzed tests are a bit more of a pain to set \n&gt; &gt; &gt; up; but they provide a lit=\r\ntle more control over how \n&gt; things get matched up.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Of course, theori=\r\nes allow for much more robust data sets by \n&gt; &gt; &gt; combining all the data po=\r\nints in every way. This can provide an \n&gt; &gt; &gt; order of magnitude more tests=\r\n automatically, but care has to be \n&gt; &gt; &gt; taken. For example, the number of=\r\n actual tests run is D^P \n&gt; where D is \n&gt; &gt; &gt; the number of data points and=\r\n P is the number of \n&gt; parameters on any \n&gt; &gt; &gt; given theory. This can gene=\r\nrate a lot of tests quickly, and the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;runDiscretely&quot; option I hacked=\r\n together for theories \n&gt; would definitely not be a preferable.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n I now know that assumptions are filtering devices for \n&gt; theories, so \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; it does not mark the test as failed. Essentially, the \n&gt; reason that an =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; assumption is marked as passing for the theory is that the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; as=\r\nsumption successfully filtered out that data combination. I get \n&gt; &gt; &gt; that=\r\n now, but I probably will use that feature very sparingly.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; The =\r\nquestion I have is what problem was the reason parameterized \n&gt; &gt; &gt; tests s=\r\nupposed to solve, and how is that different than \n&gt; the problem \n&gt; &gt; &gt; that=\r\n theories are supposed to solve?\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; [Non-text portions of this mes=\r\nsage have been removed]\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --\n&gt; &gt; ***C=\r\n=E9dric\n&gt; &gt; *\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been re=\r\nmoved]\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; Yahoo!
