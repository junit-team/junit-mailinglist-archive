While I was flipping through some pages in\nthe bookshop, I thought it was a great book.  So I bought it straightaway.\nHowever, I got very disappointed after I&#39;d got back home and took my time to\nwent through the details.\n\nTake ant for example, the presented material looks suspiciously like a cut\ndown version of those from ant docs.  I used it for a couple of times, but\nat the end I was so fed up and just used the ant docs directly.  Although\nthe docs have their fair share of inaccuracy, I&#39;ve been very happy with\nthem.\n\nPretty much the same verdict applies to other topics as well.\n\nSorry about the moaning, but I really don&#39;t like the book.  Anyway, thanks\nfor the offer, I&#39;ll consider it when I&#39;ve finished my current project.\n\nRegards,\nYiu Wing\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
