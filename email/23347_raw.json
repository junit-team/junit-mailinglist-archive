I believe there are big and important enhanc=\r\nements to be made.\n\nNote that the release frequency and pace of enhancement=\r\ns are only\nloosely connected.\n\n&gt; Specifically, I would like to see JUnit pr=\r\novide better support for other testing tools, such as mocking frameworks, B=\r\nDD tools, tools for integration/functional testing, etc. There are literall=\r\ny dozens of other tools which today provide some form of JUnit integration,=\r\n usually in the form of base test classes or custom runners for use in @Run=\r\nWith annotations. Some examples include jMock, Mockito, JMockit (my own too=\r\nl), PowerMock, JBehave, Spock, Spring Test.\n&gt;\n&gt; Ideally, users should not b=\r\ne forced to add specific code in each test class just so another tool can i=\r\nntegrate itself to the JUnit test execution process. For example, a user sh=\r\nouldn&#39;t have to add a specific rule to each test class, or to annotate pote=\r\nntially hundreds of test classes with @RunWith. Instead, better integration=\r\n hooks should be provided in the form of test run listeners, combined with =\r\na mechanism to install such listeners transparently at startup (see issue 8=\r\n0).\n\nWould this help in all of the cases above?  I can see how it might\nhel=\r\np for JMockit, which uses a static API accessed through\nconstructors.  Howe=\r\nver, other frameworks, like jMock, use a local\ncontainer like a Mockery or =\r\nContext to protect tests in different\nthreads from each other, and so it ma=\r\nkes sense to use something like\nRules to provide both the test hook and acc=\r\ness to the container, so a\ngeneric listener framework helps little there.\n\n=\r\nI just wanted to be sure how broad you believe the applicability of issue 8=\r\n0 is.\n\n&gt; Other needs that certain tools may have include the ability to hav=\r\ne custom parameters in test methods (JMockit already does this, by modifyin=\r\ng the JUnit implementation at runtime - not a clean solution, of course), a=\r\nnd to obtain access to test class instances so that field injection can occ=\r\nur (this could be added into Description).\n&gt;\n&gt; Just like TestNG, JUnit is *=\r\nfundamental software*. Other testing tools will only be able to provide the=\r\n best user experience if integration can be made seamless.\n\nI&#39;ve long been =\r\na fan of the principle (imported from Perl) that &quot;All&#39;s\nfair if you predecl=\r\nare&quot;.  I think that if using an extension requires\nmore than one line per e=\r\nxtended class, that&#39;s a place the framework\ncan improve.  However, if users=\r\n will give us that one line per class,\nwhether as a Rule, @RunWith, or base=\r\n class (in my current order of\npreference), it has a big pay-off for both t=\r\nhe framework and the user.\n For example, it allows IDEs and continuous inte=\r\ngration frameworks to\nrun individual classes or methods or subsets without =\r\nhaving to keep an\neye on a global configuration.  It also gives people who =\r\nland in the\nsource code an easily-followable hint about what&#39;s going on.\n\nI=\r\n&#39;d be happy to see an example where these goals (subset running and\nlocal c=\r\node understanding) can be met while not requiring even one line\nof per-clas=\r\ns predeclaration.\n\n   David\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In junit@yahoogroups.com, David Saff=\r\n &lt;david@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; All,\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Over the last week or so, I&#39;ve triaged=\r\n almost 200 JUnit issues that\n&gt;&gt; have accumulated over the last year, closi=\r\nng about 80 truly invalid\n&gt;&gt; issues that were fixed, duplicates, or no long=\r\ner made sense. I tagged\n&gt;&gt; the rest with:\n&gt;&gt; - regression bugs (9): there w=\r\nas an implementation of the feature that\n&gt;&gt; worked prior to the 4.9 beta (a=\r\nlthough potentially earlier than\n&gt;&gt; 4.8.x))\n&gt;&gt; - nonregression bugs (15): i=\r\nt is likely the feature has always failed\n&gt;&gt; in the documented way.\n&gt;&gt; - fe=\r\natures (~95): additions to the (implicit) spec, with\n&gt;&gt; implementations to =\r\nprovide the additions.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Thanks to everyone who has been submitting pro=\r\nblems, proposals, and\n&gt;&gt; patches. =A0I&#39;m sorry that some of you have been w=\r\naiting so long for a\n&gt;&gt; response.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; The next part of the development pl=\r\nan, in order:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; - Fix the regression bugs\n&gt;&gt; - Release a 4.9 beta 3\n&gt;&gt; =\r\n- Hopefully 4.9b3 can become the final release. =A0(I am not planning\n&gt;&gt; an=\r\ny nonregression bug fixes or new features to get into the 4.9\n&gt;&gt; release. =\r\n=A0We need to steer this ship back toward frequent releases.)\n&gt;&gt; - Create a=\r\n github project for junit.contrib.\n&gt;&gt; - Go through the backlog of pull requ=\r\nests, to see which can be\n&gt;&gt; accepted as is, and which either need changes,=\r\n or should be redirected\n&gt;&gt; into junit.contrib.\n&gt;&gt; - Work through non-regre=\r\nssion bugs for further releases in the 4.9.x series\n&gt;&gt; - Choose a number of=\r\n highly-rated feature requests to be the scope for\n&gt;&gt; 4.10, and begin (patc=\r\nh acceptance / implementation)\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I&#39;m excited to see this project keep m=\r\noving forward,\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; =A0 =A0David Saff\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n",
