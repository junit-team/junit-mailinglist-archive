Do you have a specific example in mind of how a TestSetup <br/>\nindicated that something was wrong.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have written an article on how singletons can defeat unit testing. I have <br/>\nobserved that if a test relies on the state of a singleton, then there may <br/>\nbe a desire to do one-time setup code and *that* is the sign of a code <br/>\nsmell. Can you offer a different example? I&#39;d really like the opportunity to <br/>\nlearn from it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\nJBR.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\n &gt; Your FAQ suggests that for one-time setup code you need to run<br/>\n &gt; it in a TestSuite.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is what TestSetup is for. Wrap the suite in a subclass of<br/>\nTestSetup, override setUp() (and maybe tearDown()) in your subclass,<br/>\nand it only gets run once.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlternatively, you could consider how to untangle your design so you<br/>\ndidn&#39;t need one-time setup.<br/>\n<br/>\nKent<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet your FREE download of MSN Explorer at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://explorer.msn.com/intl.asp\">http://explorer.msn.com/intl.asp</a> </span></blockquote></div>",
