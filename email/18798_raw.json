Here&#39;s some other\n&gt; thoughts, mostly around the technology for testing.\n&gt;\n&gt; Many developers like the idea of testing their own code, but just\n&gt; don&#39;t see how they can in their particular situation.  One of the most\n&gt; gratifying moments I&#39;ve had as a consultant was being able to go from\n&gt; bug report to failing acceptance test to failing unit test to code fix\n&gt; to passing unit test to passing acceptance test to check-in to bug\n&gt; fixed in about 20-30 minutes while my team-mates watched on a\n&gt; projector.  This kick-started a lot of interest in developer testing,\n&gt; and TDD, that hadn&#39;t been there before.  As a matter of fact, my first\n&gt; meeting with the team had actually contained the exchange:\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;You can&#39;t test that&quot;\n&gt; &quot;If you watch, I&#39;ll show how we could...&quot;\n&gt; &quot;No, you can&#39;t&quot;\n&gt; &quot;Yes, we can!&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; It took about a month and several dozen bug fixes (client-facing bugs,\n&gt; mind you) to get familiar with each other and patch up the design for\n&gt; testability before the above could happen.  This would have been a\n&gt; big, risky investment, if the manager hadn&#39;t bought in to the idea\n&gt; beforehand.  Ironically, for someone familiar with the wider landscape\n&gt; of software methodology, some teams are simply too focused on\n&gt; incremental results to justify that kind of Big Cleanup Up Front.\n&gt; What can we do for them?  I&#39;d like to see tools that move us toward a\n&gt; world where if you can easily think it, you can easily write the test.\n&gt;  What kinds of things can I easily think, but not easily test?\n&gt;\n&gt; 1) &quot;All Objects of a given type that are .equals should return equal\n&gt; .hashCodes&quot;  Well, here&#39;s my self-plug.  This statement could be\n&gt; handled by a Theory runner, like Marat and I described at\n&gt;\n&gt; 2) &quot;This package should have the same behavior today that it did when\n&gt; we released version 3.2.&quot;  We&#39;re getting there.  JUnitFactory\n&gt; (http://www.junitfactory.com) does a good job of generating JUnit\n&gt; tests where none exist.  If you generate tests on version 3.2, you can\n&gt; run them on today&#39;s version, and catch a lot of regressions.  [Full\n&gt; disclosure: I&#39;m a research fellow at Agitar, which produces JUnit\n&gt; Factory.  It&#39;s still very cool.]\n&gt;\n&gt; 3) &quot;During debugging, I noticed that thisUser.password was null.  It\n&gt; should have been &#39;myPassword&#39;, instead.&quot;  There are research debuggers\n&gt; that allow statements like this to be built and verified, but we&#39;re\n&gt; still waiting for them to reach the mainstream.\n&gt;\n&gt; 4) &quot;I can&#39;t call my code directly without an packagex.HttpContext and\n&gt; a packagex.UserSession and a...&quot;  This is possibly the biggest failing\n&gt; of library and framework providers today.  The ability to test code\n&gt; that depends on Package X is an important part of Package X&#39;s\n&gt; functionality, but it far too often is left to the developer of the\n&gt; package&#39;s client programs to create a testing harness, often with a\n&gt; lot of work.  Ruby on Rails ships with a built-in testing framework,\n&gt; which I think has part of the success of the framework itself and its\n&gt; integrators.  Ditto for Eclipse&#39;s plug-in development environment.  In\n&gt; my experience so far, Java web frameworks are way behind in this, but\n&gt; I&#39;d be happy to find out that there is a framework that ships with a\n&gt; usable test framework.  However, I think we can go even farther\n&gt; here--these frameworks are both better suited to acceptance tests than\n&gt; isolated unit tests.\n&gt;\n&gt; In the end, I think that if developer testing scores a Major Victory,\n&gt; it may end up being a developer-driven victory, more like version\n&gt; control or automated builds, rather than a manager-driven victory,\n&gt; like QA (of course an over-simplification).\n&gt;\n&gt;    David Saff\n&gt;\n&gt; On 1/23/07, albsavoia &lt;albsavoia@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I am still surprised that, as we near the 10th, anniversary of JUnit\n&gt; &gt; (later this year) developer/unit testing, despite its obvious benefits\n&gt; &gt; and the fact that &quot;it&#39;s the right thing to do&quot;, is still only practiced\n&gt; &gt; by a minority of developers in a minority of organizations.  And, by\n&gt; &gt; practiced I mean, SERIOUSLY practiced.  I talk with a lot of groups who\n&gt; &gt; say they *do* unit testing but have just a handful of test, rarely run,\n&gt; &gt; and no consistency, idea of code coverage, etc.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I gave talks on JUnit and the developer testing revolution at two\n&gt; &gt; JavaOne conferences (2004 and 2006) where I talked about the three\n&gt; &gt; possible outcomes for the future of developer/unit testing:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Long-Term Defeat:  Theidea of developer testing was a noble, notable,\n&gt; &gt; but ultimately short-lived blipin the history of software development.\n&gt; &gt; Almost all developers went back to the old way of thinking: testing\n&gt; &gt; isfor QA.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Minor Victory: Developer testing does not disappear, but it remains a\n&gt; &gt; nicheactivity.  Practiced only by a devoutminority of test-infected\n&gt; &gt; developers.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Major Victory: Developer testing becomes a standardsoftware development\n&gt; &gt; practice.  The rule,instead of the exception.  Releasingsoftware without\n&gt; &gt; unit/developer testing is as unthinkable as releasing softwarewithout\n&gt; &gt; QA.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I am rooting, of course, for the major victory, but I am starting to\n&gt; &gt; have my doubts, and wondering why progress is so slow.  Below is my\n&gt; &gt; analysis of what I believe is happening and I&#39;d be very interested in\n&gt; &gt; your opinion.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; In the past few years, I&#39;ve noticed that some developers are easily\n&gt; &gt; &quot;test-infected&quot;, others require longer exposure and some encouragement\n&gt; &gt; but eventually &quot;get it&quot; , and one group seems to have a built-in\n&gt; &gt; immunity.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; It&#39;s as if there are 3 basic types of test genes:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; T1 - Very susceptpible to test infection.  Show them a single JUnit\n&gt; &gt; example and they get it immediately - and start using it regularly and\n&gt; &gt; with great fervor.  When time pressure hits, they fight hard for enough\n&gt; &gt; time to test and would rather quit than produce code without tests.\n&gt; &gt; They often have framed pictures of Kent Beck on their desk :-).\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; T2 - Somewhat susceptible to test infection.  Show them how to use\n&gt; &gt; JUnit/TDD, give them some encouragement and time to appreciate the\n&gt; &gt; benefits and rewards; eventually they will become regular users.  When\n&gt; &gt; time pressure hits, however, they often revert to no-test mode without\n&gt; &gt; too much kicking and screaming.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; T3 -  Immune to test infection. There&#39;s no amount of showing and\n&gt; &gt; convincing that will get them to practice developer testing on their own\n&gt; &gt; with any regularity - if at all.  Many of them would rather quit than\n&gt; &gt; have to write tests on a regular basis.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I would love to be able to say that these genes are somewhat evenly\n&gt; &gt; distributed.  A rough Gaussian distribution.  Something like this:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; T1: 30%\n&gt; &gt; T2: 40%\n&gt; &gt; T3: 30%\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; But my experience is that developers with the T3 gene outnumber the\n&gt; &gt; combined number of those with T2 and T1 gene.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; This spells trouble because I have also found that when developers\n&gt; &gt; become managers they bring with them their attitudes toward developer\n&gt; &gt; testing.  And a T3 manager is not going to provide an environment where\n&gt; &gt; the T2 (the ones that require some time and encouragement) can become\n&gt; &gt; test infected.   And this might explain why developer testing is still\n&gt; &gt; practiced by a minority of developers in a minority of organizations.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Feedback?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Alberto\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; http://www.junitfactory.com\n&gt; &gt; Generate JUnit tests.
