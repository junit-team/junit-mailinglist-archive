It lives in <br/>\n&gt;a file.  The file lives in a source code repository.  It has <br/>\n&gt;corresponding test code that tests anything that could possibly break <br/>\n&gt;in the class.  Sometimes I check the Java class out of the repository <br/>\n&gt;and add stuff to it.  Since I practice TDD, more than likely I also <br/>\n&gt;need to add something to the corresponding test code.  When I&#39;m done, <br/>\n&gt;I check the Java class back in, along with the corresponding test <br/>\n&gt;code.  Cruisecontrol detects this and automatically runs a build on <br/>\n&gt;the build server.  If the code passes all the tests, I go home and <br/>\n&gt;life is good because I know I&#39;ll get a paycheck the next week to pay <br/>\n&gt;rent and buy food.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Based on the above description, I disagree that you practice TDD. If<br/>\nyou practiced TDD, then you would not write, &quot;...likely I also needed<br/>\nto add something to the corresponding test code.&quot; If you practiced TDD,<br/>\nyou would:<br/>\n<br/>\n1. Write a test<br/>\n2. Watch it fail<br/>\n3. Make it pass<br/>\n4. Refactor<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s the last step that leads you to see that your TestCase is doing<br/>\ntoo much is a candidate to be factored into smaller objects.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have worked on a project where test cases quickly became difficult to<br/>\nunderstand because of the massive amount of test setup -- mostly<br/>\npriming a database with known data. None of our attempts to solve the<br/>\nproblem were entirely satisfying and the team did not agree to let me<br/>\ntest the business logic entirely separately from the persistence<br/>\nmechanism. The result was this: after not seeing a certain TestCase for<br/>\na few days it would take 10 minutes or so to remember or re-understand<br/>\nwhat was going on. Also, changes to the test setup had cascading<br/>\neffects on the rest of the tests. If I had just created a new TestCase,<br/>\nI could have factored the real commonality up and kept the details<br/>\nseparate. That would certainly have helped, and this explains why I<br/>\nhave adopted that technique as a habit.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Now, based on those very simple real world requirements, just exactly <br/>\n&gt;what is it that makes your approach so superior that you will <br/>\n&gt;immediately discount all others as inadequate?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>At this point, I feel that you are being unnecessarily antagonistic.<br/>\nRudeness objection. Please tone it down.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;I know, I know, it&#39;s in the newsletter and the forthcoming book.  <br/>\n&gt;That&#39;s fabulous.  But you&#39;re preaching to the TDD converted here and <br/>\n&gt;we have found our own ways, based first on the information currently <br/>\n&gt;available and second on our own experience.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>&lt;snip /&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nGiven that your above statement (way up there) indicates that you do<br/>\nnot practice TDD, but rather that you do something else that is<br/>\nsomewhere similar to TDD, I am not sure that you can directly use your<br/>\nexperience to argue either in favor or against TDD. I apologize if that<br/>\nis harsh, but I believe it is objectively true. I make no value<br/>\njudgement: do what you do if it works, but please do not call it TDD.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;I beleive TDD has <br/>\n&gt;gathered quite a bit of momentum by now and if you have any chance of <br/>\n&gt;influencing its direction you need to provide a little more than just <br/>\n&gt;self-referential justification for your approach.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Now you have turned this into an ad-hominem attack. I do not believe<br/>\nthat many of us is interesting in this kind of thing. As a moderator, I<br/>\nam asking you to tone it down. Just because we do not write<br/>\nnovel-length, in-depth answers to your question does not mean that we<br/>\nare evading anything. It means that we are busy.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;You say, &quot;This will help us write and organize groups of tests that <br/>\n&gt;are simpler, cleaner, more understandable, and more maintainable.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;These are all noble goals for an approach to TDD.  Would you care to <br/>\n&gt;elaborate on just why you believe you have achieved these goals?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>If I were Dave -- and I clearly am not -- I would not take much<br/>\ninterest in justifying myself to someone who so rudely challenges me.<br/>\nCivilly-worded challenges are perfectly acceptable.<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you.<br/>\n<br/>\nJ.
