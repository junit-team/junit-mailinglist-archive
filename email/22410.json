I haven&#39;t been able to find good documentation for this anywhere.. Does anybody know of any good resources?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Also, assuming I can get methods to work, does it run all methods in parallel or does it run the methods in parallel by class? i.e. 1 class at a time but all the methods in that class are parallel?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Are there other gotchas or configuration settings I should be considering? I.E. I&#39;ve read a little bit on ConfigurableParallelComputer but I&#39;m not sure what it&#39;s all about..<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed] </span></blockquote></div>",
