If the method only has to be able to reverse one hard \ncoded string, we don&#39;t really need to pass in that string:\n\n    public String reverseTddSentence() {\n             return &quot;technology devolopment software a is Tdd&quot;;\n    }\n\nBut perhaps the real problem is that this is kind of a bogus \nrequirement?
