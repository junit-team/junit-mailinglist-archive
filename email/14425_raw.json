However, there *seems* to be an assumption in this thread \n&gt; that multilpe asserts per test are somehow related to each other, such \n&gt; that if one fails and I fix it then the other possibly failing asserts \n&gt; would be fixed at the same time.  That is not always, and perhaps \n&gt; generally, not the case.\n\nI believe it is, if the test is focused on a small bit of functionality.\n\t\n&gt; Following is a simple, very contrived, example of applying a CreditMemo \n&gt; to a Sale and its associated RecurringSale.  This is merely an example \n&gt; to show that multiple asserts within a test are not related to each \n&gt; other such that fixing one would fix others, but the asserts are related \n&gt; to the general action of applying a CreditMemo to an Sale.\n\t\n(Example deleted for brevity)\n\nIs it necessary (or even desirable) to test both these things in the same\ntest?  Could you perhaps do one test to show applying the CreditMemo to a\nSale does the right thing, and a second to show applying it to a\nRecurringSale is correct?  If these two actions happen in different classes,\nwhy would you need to test them at the same time?\n\n--\nJim McMaster\nmailto:jim.mcmaster@...\n\n\n\n",
