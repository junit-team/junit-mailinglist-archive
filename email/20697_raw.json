Yes, I know it is supposed to be a unit test framework... ;-)\n\n\nOn Thu, 2008-07-17 at 08:58 -0700, Hans Schwaebli wrote:\n&gt; Hi Kent,\n&gt; \n&gt; specifying dependencies is a little extra work, I agree. But it has\n&gt; advantages.\n&gt; \n&gt; Consecutive tests which depend on failed tests, are not executed,\n&gt; which speeds up the tests. It also increases the information value.\n&gt; People are not confused with dozens or even hundreds of failed tests\n&gt; when just one or two tests really failed on which most other tests\n&gt; depend. I know of situations where there are dozenzs of failed tests\n&gt; (or more) reported by CruiseControl, and noone looks into them until\n&gt; one week before release date. This happens. It makes developers afraid\n&gt; to look into the apparent mess. If there would be just one or two\n&gt; failed tests, they would look into it more likely, and sooner.\n&gt; \n&gt; The heuristic strategy would not really solve the problem. since it is\n&gt; not equivalent to the dependency specification. It would still run all\n&gt; tests, but the likelyhood that the first run tests are the cause for\n&gt; all the errors would not be very high I think, whereas you could trust\n&gt; the dependencies very much if they are set correctly.\n&gt; \n&gt; Dependencies are a frequent topic. We have it in OSGI, in issue\n&gt; tracking software, in project management software, in requirement\n&gt; specifications and in test specifications. Why not support it in JUnit\n&gt; tests too?\n&gt; \n&gt; Well, this is just some quick thoughts about it. This issue alone will\n&gt; certainly not draw people to other test frameworks, but it would\n&gt; improve JUnit I think. Noone would be forced to use that feature, but\n&gt; I think it would be good, if one could use it with JUnit, even in an\n&gt; coarse way (for example if the dependency &quot;testApplicationServerRuns&quot;\n&gt; passed).\n&gt; \n&gt; Bye,\n&gt; \n&gt; Hans\n&gt; \n&gt; --- On Thu, 7/17/08, Kent Beck &lt;kentb@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; From: Kent Beck &lt;kentb@...&gt;\n&gt; Subject: RE: [junit] Does JUnit 4 now support dependencies?\n&gt; To: junit@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Date: Thursday, July 17, 2008, 9:28 AM\n&gt; \n&gt; Hans,\n&gt; \n&gt; I agree that test dependencies are a good idea. In my experience,\n&gt; though,\n&gt; \n&gt; they aren&#39;t worth the investment to express them explicitly. I would\n&gt; rather\n&gt; \n&gt; put the same time into improving the design of the software so the\n&gt; tests can\n&gt; \n&gt; run fast.\n&gt; \n&gt; I wonder if it would be possible to infer dependencies from historical\n&gt; data,\n&gt; \n&gt; though. That and the &quot;most recently broken first&quot; heuristic might\n&gt; provide\n&gt; \n&gt; nearly optimal &quot;time to first failure&quot;, which I assume is your goal in\n&gt; \n&gt; wishing for dependencies.\n&gt; \n&gt; Regards,\n&gt; \n&gt; Kent Beck\n&gt; \n&gt; Three Rivers Institute\n&gt; \n&gt; _____ \n&gt; \n&gt; From: junit@yahoogroups. com [mailto:junit@yahoogroups. com] On Behalf\n&gt; Of\n&gt; \n&gt; hans_schwaebli\n&gt; \n&gt; Sent: Wednesday, July 16, 2008 5:58 AM\n&gt; \n&gt; To: junit@yahoogroups. com\n&gt; \n&gt; Subject: [junit] Does JUnit 4 now support dependencies?\n&gt; \n&gt; I now think that test dependencies are a good idea.\n&gt; \n&gt; Does JUnit 4.x support such dependencies, or if not, is it planned for\n&gt; \n&gt; a certain JUnit release to be added?\n&gt; \n&gt; For example, if the login test did not work, than all other tests\n&gt; \n&gt; cannot work.
