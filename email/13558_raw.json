All unit tests should pass =\r\nthrough \n&gt; the public (and protected) interfaces of a class. Most code \n&gt; t=\r\nhat can&#39;t be reached through the public/protected interfaces \n&gt; is unreacha=\r\nble code and should be deleted rather than tested. \n\nI believe this is not =\r\nonly a radical advice, it actually goes against the\nidea of unit testing.  =\r\nWhat you are describing is acceptance testing, not\nunit testing.\n\nUnit test=\r\ning allows you to test very small portions of code in order to\ncatch failur=\r\nes as soon as possible.  If all you test is public/protected\nmethods, you w=\r\nill miss an opportunity to catch a bug in a very fundamental\npiece of your =\r\ncode and you will be wasting time looking for it.\n\nFor example, imagine you=\r\n are writing a file manager that can list your files\nin several orders (by =\r\ndate, by name, etc...) and therefore, makes use of\nseveral types of algorit=\r\nhms, all private.  One day, the program starts\nshowing the files in the wro=\r\nng order.\n\nThe sort algorithm is not exposed to anyone, but if you unit-tes=\r\nt it, you\nwill catch the error much earlier instead of starting to investig=\r\nate, say,\nyour list widget.\n\nDon&#39;t be dogmatic about testing:  test whateve=\r\nr you think can break.  And\nit&#39;s okay if it includes private methods.\n\n-- \n=\r\nC=E9dric\nhttp://beust.com/testng\n\n\n\n",
