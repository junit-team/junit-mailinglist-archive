Is there anyway to do \nthis with the existing framework.  In textui as it stands nothing is \noutput for a pased test (other than &quot;.&quot;) and then the failures and \nerrors are each listed seperately.  I want to have each test&#39;s result \nlisted as the tests are executed.\n\nie.  you could have a test passed then a failed test and then another \npassed test outputed in this order.\n\nI hope that I haven&#39;t confused anyone with this roundabout question.\n\nM Lavery\n\n\n",
