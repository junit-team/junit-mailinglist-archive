If you develop under Borlands tool, you get default \n    &gt; access to the\n    &gt; graphical components on the protected level. As in VAJ \n    &gt; the components are\n    &gt; private I have to use reflection to gain access to them.\n\nI argue that there is generally a better way of testing the GUI than this.\nA real separation of model and view should allow for state-access methods\nthat return some account of the state of the gui via states of it&#39;s internal\nparts (usually in composite form).\n\nFor instance, if I have a GUI that watches a directory and does some type of\nprocessing on the things that come into that directory I might have the\nfollowing:\n\npublic class FileProcessorGUI{\n\tprivate java.awt.List filesList\n\t...other private memebers...\n\n\t...ctor&#39;s...\n\t\n\tpublic boolean isProcessing(){\n\t\treturn directoryField.getText() != null &&\n\t\t\t !directoryField.getText().equals(&quot;&quot;) &&\n\t\t\t filesList.getItemCount() &gt; 0;\n\t}\n}\n\nThe isProcessing() method of course reflects that the processing is\nhappening if all of the GUI elements meet this criteria, therefore you must\nhave some firing mechanism that would make sure that if this state were true\nthe processing really would happen.\n\n-Jason\n\n\n",
