Ashok is the founder Director of stag software private limited, a test engineering company based in Bangalore, India. He has over fifteen years of experience in the software discipline and has worked in all the phases of software development cycle. <br/>\n<br/>\n            He has conducted corporate trainings in this area for companies like Novell, Sasken, Hewlett-Packard, Philips, CISCO, Deutsche Software, Digital, Siri Technologies, BPL Telecom etc. He is active in the test community and has presented papers and conducted tutorials in the International conferences on testing like Quality Week (US and Europe), QAI&#39;s International Test Conference and SEPG Conference in India. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n            Objective of the workshop <br/>\n            The earliest entry point to validation is testing at unit level. Validation at the earliest opportunity preventing some of the implementation issues to slip into later stages is most cost-effective <br/>\n<br/>\n            This workshop will help you devise a strategy for testing an unit, discuss black-box techniques to design tests, help assess adequacy using white-box techniques, device test suites using a simple automation framework. Some common checklists/guidelines to aid cost-effective unit testing, OO/Structured-based units and how OO impacts unit testing will also be discussed. <br/>\n<br/>\n            Contents <br/>\n<br/>\n            Introduction to unit testing <br/>\n<br/>\n            -Objective of unit testing <br/>\n            -Definition of unit <br/>\n            -Types of faults that should be detected at unit testing <br/>\n<br/>\n            Black box-test design techniques <br/>\n<br/>\n            -Boundary value analysis <br/>\n            -Equivalence classes <br/>\n            -Special value <br/>\n            -Input/Output domain testing <br/>\n            -State based, Decision-table based testing <br/>\n<br/>\n            White box techniques <br/>\n<br/>\n            -Statement coverage <br/>\n            -Condition/Multiple condition coverage <br/>\n            -Path coverage <br/>\n            -File, Class, Function/Method coverage <br/>\n            -How much coverage do I am for?test execution <br/>\n<br/>\n            Generating small yet effective test cases <br/>\n<br/>\n            -Single fault/Multi-fault <br/>\n            -Orthogonal arrays <br/>\n<br/>\n            Testing OO units(Classes) <br/>\n            - Information hiding and how this affects testability <br/>\n            -Validation of an individual method <br/>\n            -Testing polymorphic methods <br/>\n            -Testing class modal behavior i.e. inter-relationships of methods <br/>\n            -Testing abstract classes <br/>\n            -Testing generic classes <br/>\n            -What to test in a derived class <br/>\n<br/>\n            Checklists/guidelines that aid in validation of unit <br/>\n            -Units that are typically user interface <br/>\n            -Units that are typically libraries <br/>\n            -Units that parts of components/frameworks <br/>\n<br/>\n            Fault models in execution and techniques of detection <br/>\n            -Resource leakage <br/>\n            -Performance issues <br/>\n            -Error recovery issues <br/>\n            -Portability issues <br/>\n            -Concurrency issues <br/>\n            -State related issues <br/>\n<br/>\n            Test documentation <br/>\n            -How much to document in a unit test plan <br/>\n            -A simple style of document unit cases quickly and easily <br/>\n<br/>\n            Automating unit tests <br/>\n            -Framework for unit test automation <br/>\n            -Writing test drivers <br/>\n            -Writing test oracles <br/>\n<br/>\n            Methodology <br/>\n            This is one-day workshop consisting of classroom discussions and a problem solving/case-study session. <br/>\n<br/>\n            Training material <br/>\n            The hard copy of the course slides will be given to every participant. <br/>\n<br/>\n            Who must attend?<br/>\n<br/>\n            Developers <br/>\n            Test Engineers <br/>\n<br/>\n            Prerequisites <br/>\n            Good programming knowledge in at-least one language <br/>\n<br/>\n           <br/>\n           <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n      Please register your nominations well in advance, as participation in the workshop is limited to 25 members only.
