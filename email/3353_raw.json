This email is best suited for the junit-devel\n&gt; email list and not for the junit list which is more geared towards using\n&gt; junit.\n&gt;\n&gt; Chris\n&gt;\n&gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; From: Michael Silverstein [mailto:msilverstein@...]\n&gt; Sent: Tuesday, November 27, 2001 10:17 AM\n&gt; To: junit-devel@...; junit@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Subject: [junit] Making JUnit more pluggable for add-ons\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Problem statement\n&gt; -----------------\n&gt; I am adding some additional profiling and metrics to JUnit test execution.\n&gt; In order to do this I need to plug in to JUnit in such a way as to perform\n&gt; some operations before and after test execution, and to extend the test\n&gt; results to contain the new metrics. Presently the framework does not allow\n&gt; me to do this without altering it.\n&gt;\n&gt; Process\n&gt; -------\n&gt; I can either graft a new branch on to the JUnit source tree that contains\n&gt; various extensions built in and give it a new name (like JUnit XYZ or\n&gt; whatever) or provide some tweaks to the present framework that satisfy my\n&gt; needs in the hope they are accepted as part of the next version.\n&gt; The purpose\n&gt; of this email is to start a discussion about this so that whatever changes\n&gt; are necessary fit in with the architectural spirit of JUnit and\n&gt; are suitable\n&gt; for inclusion in a base release. If possible, I&#39;d like to wrap this up and\n&gt; make it publicly available by the end of the year.\n&gt;\n&gt; Note: I realize test cases are the recognized currency for\n&gt; articulating new\n&gt; functionality, so once there is agreement in principle to an\n&gt; approach, I can\n&gt; provide test cases to provide more detail.\n&gt;\n&gt; Wrapping test execution\n&gt; -----------------------\n&gt; I need to be able to start profiling immediately before a user test starts\n&gt; and end profiling immediately afterward. One approach is to wrap the user\n&gt; test class that is presently instantiated in\n&gt; junit.runner.BaseTestRunner.getTest(String) with a TestDecorator subclass\n&gt; instance that manages profiling during test execution. Creating the\n&gt; decorator sounds like a job for factory method [Gamma95].\n&gt;\n&gt; Extending the results\n&gt; ---------------------\n&gt; This is presently not easy because all the various test runners\n&gt; (subclasses\n&gt; of BaseTestRunner) implement their own createTestResult() method,\n&gt; where the\n&gt; reference to the TestResult class is hard coded. I&#39;d like to be able to\n&gt; specify that dynamically as well. This also sounds like a job for factory\n&gt; method [Gamma95].\n&gt;\n&gt; Toward a unified pluggable configuration approach\n&gt; -------------------------------------------------\n&gt; A possible approach is to employ the abstract factory pattern [Gamma95]\n&gt; where the concrete factory class contains factory methods for the above\n&gt; classes and others, is specified in the preferences file or\n&gt; elsewhere. This\n&gt; sort of architectural change would substantially enable the sort of\n&gt; pluggability that I&#39;m after.\n&gt;\n&gt; Some questions and observations about the framework\n&gt; ---------------------------------------------------\n&gt; Having spent some time digging into JUnit I have the following\n&gt; questions and\n&gt; comments:\n&gt;\n&gt; - The preferences file is read in more than one place:\n&gt;   - junit.runner.BaseTestRunner.readPreferences()\n&gt;   - junit.runner.TestCaseClassLoader.readExcludedPackages()\n&gt;   I could be wrong but it seems like this is redundant execution,\n&gt; especially\n&gt; since the preferences is kept in a static variable.\n&gt;\n&gt; - The preferences (junit.runner.BaseTestRunner.fPreferences) is static. It\n&gt; strikes me that this hampers testability of the framework because it makes\n&gt; it difficult to isolate the framework preferences from the preferences for\n&gt; instances of framework classes under test.\n&gt;\n&gt; - The TestResult class provides semantics for running and stopping tests.\n&gt; This seems like a stretch for a results class, which I would imagine is\n&gt; primarily a container for execution metrics and other downstream\n&gt; information.\n&gt;\n&gt; - The TestRunner variants are very tied to presentation layer. I see this\n&gt; has been discussed at length in the past so I won&#39;t belabor it.\n&gt;\n&gt; - It seems that since all the methods in junit.framework.Assert are static\n&gt; and it does not hold any state, there is really no need to make this class\n&gt; the root of all tests, except for the convenience of not\n&gt; prefixing assertion\n&gt; methods with &#39;junit.framework.Assert&#39;. I&#39;m sure I&#39;m missing\n&gt; something here.\n&gt;\n&gt; References\n&gt; ----------\n&gt; [Gamma95] Erich Gamma et al. &quot;Design Patterns - Elements of Rusable\n&gt; Object-Oriented Software&quot;, Addison-Wesley, Reading, MA, 1995.\n&gt;\n&gt; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n&gt; Mike Silverstein\n&gt; SilverMark, Inc.\n&gt; The object testing company\n&gt; http://www.silvermark.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
