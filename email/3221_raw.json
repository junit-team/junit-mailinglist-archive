If\nprivate methods get complex enough to require testing they need to be\nrefactored out into utility classes. However, I do see a need with APIs to\nprotect end-users from classes which are solely implementation details and\nwhich are subject to change. These facilities are package protected. If\nthey survive the test of time, they can be made public, but it is very\nhard to make a public facility private or take it away. If it&#39;s public,\nsomeone in the field will use it and will scream when it&#39;s changed. Using\npackage access controls allows me the freedom to refactor and improve that\ndesign.  The unit tests give me confidence that I&#39;ve done it right.\n\nOn Thu, 8 Nov 2001, Jason Rogers wrote:\n\n&gt; With all of the great tools available (e.g. IDEs, Ant,\n&gt; make) this really becomes a matter of choice.  I prefer\n&gt; having a different package for the tests as I prefer to\n&gt; test only the public interfaces (for which I depend on the\n&gt; Smalltalk-ism where, technically, everything is public).\n&gt; If the public interface is written effectively it will\n&gt; prove the correctness of the private interface (which\n&gt; includes private, protected, and package protected\n&gt; methods).\n&gt;\n&gt; Some may argue that bugs can creep into the privates\n&gt; unawares.  This becomes less and less of an option as the\n&gt; public interface&#39;s design improves.  I avoid the white box\n&gt; approach like the plague because it affords me the\n&gt; opportunity to make my design better.  A little extra work\n&gt; up front usually pays off for me in the end.\n&gt;\n&gt; ...just my $0.02\n&gt;\n&gt; -jason\n&gt;\n&gt; --- Eric Vought &lt;evought@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Why not do both?

The\n&gt; &gt; compiler doesn&#39;t care that they are in separate trees as\n&gt; &gt; long as the\n&gt; &gt; package structure is the same. This allows the tests to\n&gt; &gt; be compiled and\n&gt; &gt; packaged separately but still have access to package\n&gt; &gt; methods and\n&gt; &gt; classes. This is what we are beginning to do in all of\n&gt; &gt; our projects.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; On Thu, 8 Nov 2001 lewold@... wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; According this topic I found two different views:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; -) In the sourceforge FAQ they propose to use a\n&gt; &gt; separate test package\n&gt; &gt; &gt; for the unit tests.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; -) In various documents linked on the JUnit homepage\n&gt; &gt; (e.g. JUnit bets\n&gt; &gt; &gt; practices) they propose to keep the unit tests in the\n&gt; &gt; package of the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; classes to be tested.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Personally I like the separate package more, as I don&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; want to ship\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the unit tests with the project. At no costs I want to\n&gt; &gt; manually\n&gt; &gt; &gt; exclude the test classes during shipment. Addiditonally\n&gt; &gt; I simply find\n&gt; &gt; &gt; this approach more structured - in our last project we\n&gt; &gt; had for each\n&gt; &gt; &gt; package a .test package.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; The separate package however has the main drawback for\n&gt; &gt; me that I cant\n&gt; &gt; &gt; test package private methods. This forces me to make\n&gt; &gt; more methods\n&gt; &gt; &gt; public than I want just for testing purposes.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; What are your experiences and preferences in this area\n&gt; &gt; ?\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Chris Lewold\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Your use of Yahoo!
