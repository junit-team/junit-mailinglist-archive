Even worse: two possibly overlapping, but often disjoint, sets of\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; test fixture objects in the same test case class. Some tests use\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; fixture A and others use fixture B. Why not put those in separate test\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; case classes for clarity?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Because of the activation energy required to split off a new class, move\n&gt; &gt; the right methods into it, remember to link it into the next level up,\n&gt; &gt; add it to change control, fix the pesky layout infelicities the IDE likes\n&gt; &gt; to avoid providing a configure-out option for, refactor the class\n&gt; &gt; comments, etc?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; [Pairing is good. Would that I could.]\n&gt;\n&gt; It sounds more like quite a viscous environment (either the codebase,\n&gt; the IDE, or a combination of the two): it&#39;s easier to do a bad thing\n&gt; than a good thing.\n&gt;\n&gt; Which IDE, you poor soul? In Eclipse it&#39;s just &quot;new class, copy, run\n&gt; tests, delete, run tests, update, commit&quot;. Well, except for the class\n&gt; comments, I guess. For that you&#39;re on your own. :)\n\nEclipse.\n\nSo that&#39;s &quot;new class&quot;. Copy. Fix layout. Fix suite(). Run tests. Delete\ntests. Run. Delete other tests in other class. Run. Check that the two\nclasses are a partition of the original class. (One *must* do this, so\nit&#39;s probably better to do moves than deletes.) Look for shared code\nand partition it or move it to a suitable (possibly new) superclass. \n(There&#39;s usually some helper code like this.) Link the suite() into\nthe parent suite. (Yes, we don&#39;t use the automatic recursive suite\ncreation. Close call: but sometimes being able to trivially comment\nout subsuites has made bug-tracking much much easier, since we do\nsometimes end up with context-sensitive problems. Perhaps we just \nhave too many global caches.) Run complete test suite. Stare hard \nat the new classname, rename to suitable, because now you have to \nintroduce it to CVS, and renaming it later is a pain. Perform \nintroduction. No, I don&#39;t want the file CVSed when it&#39;s created, since\nif I want to back it out later (when I realise I made a complete mess)\nI don&#39;t want dirty footprints in the repository. OK, everything works.\nCheck in. Wait forever for CVS to complete. Time passes. Maybe there&#39;s\nsome mail to read? Yes. Whoppee, CVS done. Change to paranoia window.\nCVS update. Wait forever for CVS to complete. Time passes. Mail already\nread, read news instead. CVS completes. ant build, run tests, all pass.\nHooray! Don&#39;t do this on a Friday afternoon, you&#39;ll likely miss your\ntrain or break the build.\n\nSomewhere in there I fixed the auto-layout. And did a CVS update (Wait.\nTime passes. Get tea.) before running the tests. \n\nWhat do you do that if I did it too I could do better? Apart from using\na faster CVS server, that is.\n\n-- \nChris &quot;electric hedgehog&quot; Dollin\nIt&#39;s called *extreme* programming, not *stupid* programming.\n\n\n",
