I myself never really found it all that useful, nor \n&gt; that much of a distraction.  What did you use it for?  Did you fix \n&gt; errors before failures, or vice versa?  Did you find one harder to fix \n&gt; than the other?\n&gt; \n\nIt&#39;s simply useful that Eclipse tells me which are which. Errors \nnormally point me toward unexpected couplings and dependencies whereas \nfailures tend not to. With an error my reaction is normally, &quot;Why the \nhell did *that* break?&quot; whereas with a failure, I normally have a pretty \ngood idea why the piece that broke is the piece that broke. Sometimes an \nerror indicates something that wasn&#39;t tested as well as it should have \nbeen, and shows me that I need to add another test case to cover it.\n\nSince I rarely get very far before running the test suite, it&#39;s rare \nthat I have multiple unrelated errors and failures. However, sometimes \none change does cause both, and I normally do look at the errors first. \nThey seem to more reliably point me at the bug.\n\n-- \n﻿Elliotte Rusty Harold  elharo@...\nXML in a Nutshell 3rd Edition Just Published!\nhttp://www.cafeconleche.org/books/xian3/\nhttp://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0596007647/cafeaulaitA/ref=nosim\n\n",
