Its been about 5yrs since I made a significant part\nof my living from writing code. Instead I spend most of my time and effort\ncoaching and training clients on the basic Agile ideas. In the past few\nweeks I&#39;ve spent a lot of time with a client that builds Java applications.\nThis has brought me back to JUnit.\n\nI&#39;m in shock, you&#39;re discussing how to use Lambda&#39;s well when some of the\nbasic elements are hard to use correctly. Examples Categories - require a\nspecial runner and the use of suites; Parameterized Data - requires a\nspecial runner etc.\n\nThe Categories is the worst one. The client had some slow tests that should\nbe removed from their main unit test suite and run only on nightly builds.\nOver time they want to revisit the tests, speed them up (using Fake DB and\nIn Memory streams etc). In the world of Nunit no problem we would just mark\nthem as members of the category slow and run them separately on the build\nserver. In JUnit the requirement to use suites for this capability was so\npainful that we just migrated the tests to a separate eclipse project.\nTheir parameterized tests several were missing the annotations for the\nspecial test runner. There are a number of other small details where JUnit\nmakes it a little harder than necessary to do the work.\n\nSuggestion before debating an attractive Lambda syntax, make the existing\nfeatures easy to use. In addition take NUnit for spin you might find some\ngood ideas on how to handle many of these details.\n\n-- \nCheers\nMark Levison\nAgile Pain Relief Consulting &lt;http://agilepainrelief.com/notesfromatooluser&gt;\n | Writing &lt;http://agilepainrelief.com/notesfromatooluser/&gt;\nProud Sponsor of Agile Tour Gatineau Ottawa &lt;http://goagiletour.ca/&gt; Nov\n28, Toronto &lt;http://www.torontoagilecommunity.org/display/PUBLIC/Home&gt;\n 26 and Montreal &lt;http://agilemontreal.ca/agile-tour-2012/&gt; 24\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n",
