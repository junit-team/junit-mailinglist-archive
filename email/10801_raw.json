If #3 is very slow, then consider extracting an \n&gt; interface and doing #1. Do not do #2, since that is testing two things \n&gt; at once, and that will make you feel pain. (And here you are.)\n\nNot so much pain yet as worry.  In the context of my current application I\ndon&#39;t think there would (ever?) be much pain in this process - because these\nobjects (in the production code) can not come into existence any other way,\nconsequently their serialisation/deserialisation code is one of the first\nthings to be tested and is executed pretty thoroughly.  However in other\nprojects...\n\nThank you.  \n\n",
