Is JUnit=\r\n a unit testing tool? or is it a testing management tool in which we store =\r\ntest cases and test execution results\n&gt; 2. I have download Junit from the h=\r\nttp://www.junit.org/, however I have not been able to &quot;load&quot; the tool. I am=\r\n not sure on which file to execute? I am running on Windows XP SP2. \n&gt; \n&gt; I=\r\n understand that these might be newbie questions, however any pointers you =\r\nmight provide me would be very appericated\n&gt;\n\n\n\n",
