Question, however: is it that often tha=\r\nt you are editing\njust the grouping of test suites, and not the contents of=\r\n the tests\nthemselves?  I go through periods of reorganization (like you ar=\r\ne),\nbut I find that the steady-state is that I&#39;m already editing my Java\nmu=\r\nch more often than my XML.\n\n&gt;&gt; One advantage of ant is that you can fail fa=\r\nst, deciding that\n&gt;&gt; if suite A fails, don&#39;t even bother running suite B. =\r\n=A0Also,\n&gt;&gt; sometimes the build system or political structure of a team can=\r\n\n&gt;&gt; make it easier to edit XML files than Java, in which case the\n&gt;&gt; ant fi=\r\nle might make sense.\n&gt;\n&gt; Some details on the environment:\n&gt;\n&gt; * Rather smal=\r\nl project and team (3-4 active developers,\n&gt; including myself),\n&gt; * Rather =\r\nvanilla J2EE web application (Struts-based web gui and\n&gt; Hibernate+RDBMS ba=\r\nckend)\n&gt; * Rather mature development stage\n&gt; * All main activities (develop=\r\nment, deployment and testing) are\n&gt; performed entirely with the IDE (Eclips=\r\ne)\n&gt; * Currently lacking an automated testing/build environment (i.e.\n&gt; eve=\r\nrything is done manually)\n&gt;\n&gt; could these be of any help in making a decisi=\r\non (or in finding a\n&gt; tradeoff)...?\n\nA bit of a tangent: does the package s=\r\ntructure follow the logical\nclumping of tests?  If so, then a globbing solu=\r\ntion like ant&#39;s junit\ntask or the CpSuite runner for JUnit 4 could be a low=\r\n-cost solution.\n\n   David Saff\n\n",
