The project is quite dead but if you&#39;re interested in the <br/>\nidea behind it, you can have a look at JUnit-addons Runner.  Same idea, <br/>\nsimpler implementation.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &quot;During their execution, the classes have access to <br/>\n&gt; external ressources (database or network connections...) <br/>\n&gt; via Services and can use the Logger to save useful information.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Vladamir, are you saying you don&#39;t need such a Logger any more?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Never say &#39;never&#39; but I never had to use a logger for my tests.  So far. <br/>\n  But if I have to, I want to have this option open.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy experience with System.out is that you don&#39;t write them when you are <br/>\nwriting your tests, but only when something goes wrong.  If your test <br/>\nfor &#39;Object myfunction()&#39; is:<br/>\n<br/>\n    Integer actual = myClass.myfunction();<br/>\n    assertEquals(new Integer(3), actual);<br/>\n<br/>\nand it fails with a ClassCastException (typically you don&#39;t know much <br/>\nabout what really happens), you will be tempted to put a System.out to <br/>\nsee what was returned:<br/>\n<br/>\n    System.out.println(&quot;returned class : &quot; + actual.getClass());<br/>\n<br/>\nIMO this smells because you will have to look at the result (output, <br/>\nlog) and after writing a few hundreds of these statements your console <br/>\n(or log) will be flooded with unuseful output (because you have now <br/>\ninformation about something that works).<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I do instead is use the JUnit-addons library (of course, since I <br/>\nwrote it!) and write:<br/>\n<br/>\n    ObjectAssert.assertInstanceOf(Integer.class, actual);<br/>\n<br/>\n1) if it fails, I will get the message &quot;expected of class &lt;Integer&gt; but <br/>\nwas of class &lt;Boolean&gt;&quot;:  Exactly the same information as with a <br/>\nSystem.out BUT...<br/>\n<br/>\n2) if it doesn&#39;t fail, I will not get any output<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; How do people fix such a failing test? What information do you use to<br/>\n&gt; diagnose and fix it? Or is it always the time to reach for your<br/>\n&gt; debugger?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I hope that I explained how I fix failing tests: I try to grab as much <br/>\ninformation as possible but without writing anything on the console/log.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd how can a logger be useful: typically to record the environment <br/>\nwhere the tests were executed (name of the server, database, what is the <br/>\nlocale, ...) and not how they were executed.  But I may change my mind <br/>\non this.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Vladimir<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nVladimir Ritz Bossicard<br/>\nwww.bossicard.com</div>",
