As in, once you reduce the number of tests<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; against a live database to a handful that run in 20 seconds, there&#39;s no<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; need to go any further.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I did that on my last project. That was still more than 75 tests, which<br/>\n&gt; had potential interactions with each other. It&#39;s much easier to rollback<br/>\n&gt; transactions than, when a test fails, to reload a database and run an<br/>\n&gt; individual test against it just to see if it was a real failure or an<br/>\n&gt; interaction.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>75 tests against a database ran in 20 seconds? Not bad.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  &gt; And I disagree: you /can/ get rid of all the tests against the database<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; for a given application, as long as you move the database integration to<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; a separate project, write it once, and use it throughout the enterprise.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Well, that might work for you, but the freezing of that part of the<br/>\n&gt; system and loss of ability to refactor would kill me. I don&#39;t see a<br/>\n&gt; database table definition as any different from code to generate an HTML<br/>\n&gt; form; it&#39;s all part of the application, and it all changes and moves<br/>\n&gt; around as necessary. This means I not infrequently move code from the<br/>\n&gt; database to Java or vice versa, just as I would move code from one class<br/>\n&gt; to another.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You seem to be describing freezing schemas. I am not. I am talking about <br/>\n  freezing the persistence mechanism--the O/R mapping technology--and <br/>\nreusing it across applications. There&#39;s no need to test the O/R mapping <br/>\ntechnology for each application, but rather only for the various mapping <br/>\nrules you use. One small set of tests per mapping rule is often enough.<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJ. B.
