I didn&#39;t understand<br/>\nwhat does the application, what client thought and what what problem<br/>\nyou strike with. I also didn&#39;t understand your Stability and<br/>\nReliability aspect. I guess this is because I didn&#39;t understand your<br/>\npayment processing example. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;kentb&quot; &lt;kentb@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; All,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Last week on succeeding days I encountered two situations, one where<br/>\n&gt; system-level tests were valuable and unit tests would have been<br/>\nuseless and<br/>\n&gt; one where the reverse was true. Since simply the level of the tests<br/>\nis not<br/>\n&gt; sufficient to decide where to test, I thought a bit more about how I<br/>\nshould<br/>\n&gt; decide where to test. I came to three criteria:<br/>\n&gt;   * The cost of writing and running the test<br/>\n&gt;   * The stability of the interface the test is, errr..., testing<br/>\n&gt;   * The reliability of the code satisfying the test<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I wrote this up in a little paper:<br/>\n&gt; www.threeriversinstitute.org/WhereToTest.html. Comments welcome.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Kent Beck<br/>\n&gt; Three Rivers Institute<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>",
