I happen to prefer an OOP solution as a\n&gt; &gt; first choice.  =\r\n(&quot;test&quot; vs &quot;@Test&quot;)\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m not sure why you think that being forced to=\r\n have a method name \nstart\n&gt; with &quot;test&quot; is OOP?\n\nMDT ---&gt; I agree the conv=\r\nersation is a bit muddled here.  It is the \ncombination of inheritance + &quot;t=\r\nest&quot; that provides the method \ninvocation solution.  The approach stands in=\r\n (stylistic) contrast to \nthe two popular declarative solutions - using a d=\r\nescriptor document \nor an annotation (in this case to cause method invocati=\r\non).  \n\nIn other words, I don&#39;t want to &quot;throw out&quot; an OOP inheritance \nsol=\r\nution just because it also includes notating a method with &quot;test&quot;.\n\n&gt; 2)  W=\r\nhat I&#39;m not prepared to accept, is an assertion that\n&gt; &gt; declarative progra=\r\nmming is &quot;better&quot; (when there are two workable\n&gt; &gt; choices) by virtue of it=\r\ns existence.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; It is better in this case, because munging your method=\r\n names so \nthat a tool\n&gt; can pick them off is clearly better addressed with=\r\n annotations.\n\nMDT ---&gt; Cedric - I do (respectfully) disagree with you on t=\r\nhis \npoint.  The term &quot;optimization for code completion&quot; attempts to \ncaptu=\r\nre the notion that naming of Classes and Methods can be done in \na manner t=\r\nhat provides more (immediate) clarity within an IDE  \ncontext.\n\nIn an earli=\r\ner post - you referred to it as adding &quot;adding metadata \nto that method&quot; na=\r\nme.  In addition to code completion, having all \nlike method names begin wi=\r\nth a prescribed verb is useful for sorting \nmethods.  For instance, in Ecli=\r\npse when one types &#39;Ctrl-o&#39; followed \nby &#39;test&#39; - you very quickly list the=\r\n test methods in a class vs. \nsupporting (perhaps private?) methods.\n\nI hav=\r\ne not seen alot said about &quot;optimization for code completion&quot; - \nas an exam=\r\nple the following link documents a specific API \npromoting &quot;exists&quot;, &quot;read&quot;=\r\n, &quot;register&quot; for transparent persistence \nrelated operations.\n\n     http://=\r\ngtcgroup.com/joppa/The.Road.to.Joppa.html#JoppaCRUD\n\nAn advanced verificati=\r\non technique is to reflectively interrogate \nmethod names on functional cla=\r\nsses (during unit testing) to ensure \nthey conform to either platform, corp=\r\norate or application method \nnaming conventions.  \n\nThe strength of your co=\r\nnviction in this area is causing me to \nwonder.  Am I the only Java &quot;guy&quot; t=\r\nhat finds benefit (on a fifteen \ndeveloper project on two continents) in ha=\r\nving a test method begin \nwith he word &quot;test&quot; - or, a callback method begin=\r\n with &quot;pre&quot; \nor &quot;post&quot; - or, a transparent persistence registration begin \n=\r\nwith &quot;register&quot;???\n\nOr said more simply - I find value in having test metho=\r\nds begin \nwith &quot;test&quot; even if not required by the invocation mechanism.  An=\r\nd \nif there is a (platform or corporate or application) naming \nconvention =\r\nI like it enforced in a testing context.\n\n&gt;  In the case of @Ignore - no\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; question about it (in my mind) - that is a problem begging for a\n&gt; &gt; decl=\r\narative solution.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Following your logic, shouldn&#39;t you rename testFo=\r\no() to ignoreFoo\n() then?\n&gt;\n\nSure.  Except for the fact that &quot;test&quot; is a lo=\r\nng-term perscription \nand &quot;ignore&quot; is (presumably) transitory.  The nuances=\r\n around which \ncapability is appropriatly declared and which capability is =\r\n\nappropriately inherited are more subtle than a verb study.\n\nIn this case, =\r\n&quot;ignore&quot; is a contextual assignment.  It might \nmean, &quot;ignore until I get t=\r\nhis test method working&quot;.  Whereas &quot;test&quot; \nmeans &quot;always test&quot; unless decla=\r\nred otherwise.  &quot;Ignore&quot; is \n(conceptual) override of &quot;test&quot;.  They are not=\r\n peers - so, a \ndifferent stylistic implementation might be warranted.\n\n \n&gt;=\r\n See where this leads?\n&gt; \n&gt; -- \n&gt; C=E9dric\n&gt; http://testng.org\n\n\n\n\n\n",
