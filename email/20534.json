Whether the tests are simple (one assertion per test) or complex is an<br/>\northogonal issue.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis feature request has come up a few times on the TestNG mailing-list as<br/>\nwell, and I have sometimes felt this need occasionally myself.<br/>\n<br/>\nThink of it as another granularity level of insight inside your tests:  if<br/>\nyou want the big picture, you look at the HTML reports.  If you want the<br/>\nfine picture, you look at the source.  And if you want something in-between<br/>\n(&quot;are we making sure the collection is the right size?&quot;), you could use this<br/>\nhypothetical assert log without the source noise.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nCédric<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOn Mon, Jun 9, 2008 at 3:30 PM, J.

Yes, many people have said they want<br/>\nto log assertions in tests because they want the warm fuzzy feedback<br/>\nthat their tests are running and assertion what they think they are<br/>\nasserting. Logging is just one, and in my opinion a bad, way to do<br/>\nthis. I believe it is much better to write simpler tests.<br/>\n&gt; 1) eliminating redundant logging statements - Many logging statements<br/>\n&gt; in a JUnit test case simply output information that you&#39;ve already<br/>\n&gt; told JUnit about in your assertions. Developers often put these in as<br/>\n&gt; a &#39;sanity check&#39; to verify that the test is doing what they expected.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\nIf your tests need such a sanity check, then I believe they should be<br/>\nsimpler.<br/>\n&gt; 2) improving assertion messages - it&#39;s often the case that the<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; first time you see the message for an assertion will be when the<br/>\n&gt; assertion fails, which may not happen until you run a regression test<br/>\n&gt; many moons after you coded the test. Unless you see the message<br/>\n&gt; displayed when you are developing the test, you won&#39;t realize that the<br/>\n&gt; message - if you provided one - is not be very helpful. Better<br/>\n&gt; assertion messages also help to communicate to a developer what the<br/>\n&gt; point of the assertion is both when it fails and when reading the<br/>\n&gt; test.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\nIf you aren&#39;t going to think about the failure message when you write<br/>\nit, then don&#39;t write one.<br/>\n&gt; 3) see finer-grain test results. Every assertion is a mini-test on its<br/>\n&gt; own, but JUnit these mini-tests are invisible until they fail.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\nAbsolutely not. Assertions are not mini-tests. A test is a test. If<br/>\nyou have multiple unrelated assertions in a test, then move them into<br/>\ntheir own tests. This leads to a number of benefits (more accurate<br/>\ntest count metrics, more information when a test fails, easier to<br/>\nisolate the cause of a failure).<br/>\n&gt; 4) by making logging easy, it can help to avoid the<br/>\n&gt; using-system-outs-instead-of-asserts syndrome, where new junit test<br/>\n&gt; writers will write &quot;test cases&quot; that actually just write a bunch of<br/>\n&gt; stuff to the console that the test writer then eyeballs for expected<br/>\n&gt; results<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\nWhy would anyone use JUnit to spit things out to the console? If they<br/>\nwant output on the console, and they&#39;re not just using that as a way<br/>\nto learn to use JUnit, then they shouldn&#39;t use JUnit.<br/>\n&gt; There are some problems with logging assertions that I have<br/>\n&gt; encountered:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 1) if iterating over a collection and asserting each element, your log<br/>\n&gt; can be overwhelmed. Maybe it would be useful to have some way of<br/>\n&gt; hinting that a particular assertion should not create notifications;<br/>\n&gt; maybe not.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\nI don&#39;t even want to think about how slowly tests will run, and how<br/>\nmuch time I would waste deciding which tests should log what and when.<br/>\nIt&#39;s much easier just to add logging where I want it.<br/>\n&gt; Is there any appetite out there for adding assertion logging (or<br/>\n&gt; assertion notification) into the junit 4 framework? I would be<br/>\n&gt; happy to do the work if I thought it would be accepted into the<br/>\n&gt; main junit distribution. Or maybe this capability already exists<br/>\n&gt; in some way in junit 4 that I am not aware of?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\nYes, there is such an appetite, but I hope there is a bigger appetite<br/>\nnot to include it.<br/>\n----<br/>\nJ.
