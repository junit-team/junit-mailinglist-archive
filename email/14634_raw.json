How would you feel about making &quot;private&quot; just\na \n&gt; suggestion? i.e. why not allow anyone to invoke any private method\nfrom \n&gt; any class they want to? Of course, they would know when doing this\nthat \n&gt; they were doing something skanky. Would you be happy with such a \n&gt; language? If not, why not? \n\nSounds like Smalltalk. And Python, for that matter. People manage to\nwrite code in those languages without any problems.\n\n&gt; If you think the private keyword should be just a suggestion, then\nI \n&gt; think we will just have to agree to disagree at this point.\n\nThe private keyword _is_ only a suggestion. It&#39;s a strong suggestion,\none that the compiler respects, but one that is not guaranteed to be\nhonoured by the runtime environment.\n\nOut of curiousity: if you couldn&#39;t have private methods, would you\nchange your coding style at all? Would that approach end up being\nbetter, or worse? Would you consider trying it out?\n\n(I have, it did change my style, and I believe it was for the better -\nbut that&#39;s me)\n\n&gt; But if you \n&gt; don&#39;t think private is unnecessary, then I think there&#39;s a\ncontradiction \n&gt; in your philosophy that&#39;s worth exploring further.\n\nIndeed. Now, do you think it&#39;s possible to write code without a\nprivate keyword? If not, how do you explain, for example, Smalltalk\nand Python? If you do, then I think there&#39;s a contradiction in your\nphilosophy that&#39;s worth exploring further.\n\nOr should we just end the discussion?\n\n[Quick digression: Python does have private methods of a sort... but\nthey _are_ a naming convention (leading double underscores), which are\nonly partly enforced by the environment. To quote _Dive Into Python_:\n&quot;If you try to call a private method, Python will raise a slightly\nmisleading exception, saying that the method does not exist. Of course\nit does exist, but it&#39;s private, so it&#39;s not accessible outside the\nclass.Strictly speaking, private methods are accessible outside their\nclass, just not easily accessible. Nothing in Python is truly private;\ninternally, the names of private methods and attributes are mangled\nand unmangled on the fly to make them seem inaccessible by their given\nnames. You can access the __parse method of the MP3FileInfo class by\nthe name _MP3FileInfo__parse. Acknowledge that this is interesting,\nbut promise to never, ever do it in real code. Private methods are\nprivate for a reason, but like many other things in Python, their\nprivateness is ultimately a matter of convention, not force.}]\n\n\n\n",
