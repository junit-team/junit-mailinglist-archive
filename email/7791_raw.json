Start\nout by reading chapters 1, 2, 6, and 9.\n\nAnd just to make things less daunting a .jar file is just a glorified zip\nfile.  The jar tool (It came with your jdk) uses the same syntax as the\nunix tar command so:\n      jar -cf sample.jar sample -&gt; takes the contents of the sample\ndirectory and puts it in a jar file named sample.jar\n      jar -xf sample.jar -&gt; unpacks the contents of sample.jar\n\nA .war file is just a .jar file with webapp deployment descriptors in it.\nA .ear file is just a .jar file with a collection of .jar and .war files\nalong with enterprise application deployment descriptors in it.\n\nGood luck,\n-Phil\n\n\n\n                                                                                                    \n                      &quot;james_khu&quot;                                                                   \n                      &lt;james_khu@yahoo         To:      junit@yahoogroups.com                       \n                      .com&gt;                    cc:                                                  \n                                               Subject: [junit] JUnit and EJB! please help, a       \n                      04/19/03 01:53           beginner                                             \n                      AM                                                                            \n                      Please respond                                                                \n                      to junit                                                                      \n                                                                                                    \n                                                                                                    \n\n\n\n\nHi\n\nI am a graduate student at a local university. I was just given a\nresearch project on how to do both unit testing and load testing of\nEJB. They told me to explore the possibility of using JUnit to unit\ntest EJB.\n\nI must say that I am still pretty new at this EJB, tomcat, and\nJUnit. my previous programming experience has been java IO,applet,\nswing, and some servlet.\n\nCan any of you guys give a pointer on where is the best place to\nstart looking for simple sample codes to run and play with ? I look\ninto jakarta.cactus website, but they don;t offer step by step\ninstructions on how to begin testing ejb. I don&#39;t even know how to\npack EAR, WAR, or jar file.\n\nany help would be greatly appreciated\n\n\n\nTo unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\njunit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n\n\nYour use of Yahoo!
