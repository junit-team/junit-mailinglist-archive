It&#39;s the simple things that are most likely to go wrong:\ncut and paste errors, bad search and replace, off-by-one in a conditional\nor loop, bas parenthesization, etc. If you look for the simple errors, you\ncatch them before they become complex problems.\n\nOn Tue, 6 Nov 2001, J.

I leave it as an exercise to the reader to imagine how that\n&gt; could happen. HINT: It happened to me. :)\n&gt;\n&gt; My suggestions:\n&gt;\n&gt; 1. Use the immutable object idiom. (No setX() methods. If you need a new\n&gt; value, make a new object.)\n&gt; 2. Write a simple test to ensure that what you pass to the constructor is\n&gt; what the getX() methods answer.\n&gt;\n&gt; Do this until you start writing perfect code all the time. :)\n&gt;\n&gt; JBR.\n&gt;\n&gt; ----- Begin original message -----\n&gt; How about a class that can&#39;t possibly break?  Say a class with only setters\n&gt; and getters?\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; _________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Get your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com/intl.asp\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
