And\n&gt; it&#39;s okay if it includes private methods.\n\nThis brings up an interesting question -- at least, for me.\n\nWell, two, I guess.\n\nFirst: Where is the line that divides &quot;being dogmatic&quot; from &quot;trusting a \nheuristic&quot;? In this case, it was &quot;test only through the public \ninterface&quot;, which is a heuristic I follow, because it generally leads me \nto a better design. (I&#39;ll omit the reasons, because the community has \nwritten about them at length. Google is your friend.) Cedric, who seems \nnot to follow that heuristic, wonders whether doing so is dogmatic, and \nrightly so.\n\nI looked up &quot;dogma&quot; at dictionary.com and got this definition:\n\n&quot;An authoritative principle, belief, or statement of ideas or opinion, \nespecially one considered to be absolutely true.&quot;\n\nAnd &quot;heuristic&quot;:\n\n(adj.) Of or relating to a usually speculative formulation serving as a \nguide in the investigation or solution of a problem\n\n(n.) A heuristic (adj.) process or method.\n\nSo the dividing line appears to be the notion of &quot;absolute truth&quot;. This \nleads me to recast the question as:\n\nWhere is the line that divides &quot;absolute truth&quot; from &quot;sensible default&quot;? \nIn other words, I only test a private method if I am in a situation \nwhere I have to. What makes this stance dogmatic, rather than heuristic?\n\nJust an open question for the community to consider.\n\nThe second question is perhaps more of a comment than a question. I \nthink that when a novice asks us a question, it&#39;s OK for us to provide a \nsimple, dogmatic-sounding answer. This person is learning, and is \ntherefore not well-informed about the consequences of the choices he has \nin front of him. As a result, we have a responsibility to suggest the \ncourse we think is right and ask him to try it so he can learn the way \nwe did. In this case, a little dogma doesn&#39;t hurt. Notice, though, that \nit&#39;s dogma from the learner&#39;s perspective, and only due to a lack of \nexperience. For me, at least, it&#39;s a heuristic. :)\n\nIncidentally, I only bring this up because we tend to see dogma as \nnegative, and I don&#39;t see why that must be. That said, perhaps we ought \nto ask more questions before giving answers....\n\nTake care, everyone.\n-- \nJ. B.
