You can do it sometimes and\n&gt;&gt; not other times. I only wish that those who choose this approach\n&gt;&gt; measure the difference between the two.\n&gt;\n&gt;Well, for me the measure is pretty easy. I no longer spend ten minutes\n&gt;working out the interface for a class only to discover that it&#39;s a\nnice\n&gt;interface, but not the interface I need.\n\nAHA! Let the record show...\n\n&gt;In fact, quite often these days, I find myself practicing\n&quot;test-second,\n&gt;implementation-third&quot; programming. I&#39;ll be in the middle of\nprogramming\n&gt;a servlet, and I&#39;ll realize I need to be able to find, say, a Foo\nobject\n&gt;based on the current IP address of the request. At that point, I&#39;ll\njust\n&gt;make up, on the spot, the most convenient interface for that, and use\n&gt;it, even though that interface, and possibly not even the object I&#39;m\n&gt;using, exists.\n&lt;snip /&gt;\n\nThis is a great approach. I would say this: if only you were working\nSmalltalk or Ruby, you could skip the &quot;interface&quot; bit and just writing\nsomething -- anything -- to hold the method you need. Then you\ntest-drive that thing. Then you identify how to refactor it into the\nframework. Very, very cool.\n\n&gt;I used to be a very bottom-up programmer, but the speed and ease of\nthis\n&gt;top-down approach has completely converted me. I now write probably\none\n&gt;half to one third the amount of code I used to write to get equivalant\n&gt;functionality in an application. My customers really appreciate this.\n\nI will do this religiously and yell at you if it fails me. :)\n\nJ. B.
