It doesn&#39;t. To Java, files are byte sequences, nothing more.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; The program says &quot;read [or write] the next K bytes down this<br/>\n&gt; stream&quot;. If &quot;this stream&quot; happened to be connected to a record-<br/>\n&gt; oriented file, Java should do exactly what the program says -<br/>\n&gt; which is to invoke the filing-system call appropriate to writing <br/>\n&gt; to that file, I would have thought, not just splattering the<br/>\n&gt; bytes randomly into the file&#39;s blocks.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Nothing&#39;s random. It puts the data where the program says to put the <br/>\ndata, but it always treats the file as a sequence of bytes. Every API in <br/>\nJava for file access--FileInputStream, RandomAccessFile, FileChannel, <br/>\netc.--sees the file as a contiguous sequence of bytes. Any notion of <br/>\nrecord boundary is in the application logic, not the Java library.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; [Which is why Jena&#39;s RDF/XML writer uses line.separator at a<br/>\n&gt;  critical point; we had been generating RDF/XML that some <br/>\n&gt;  application running on Windows Did Not Like. Having the user<br/>\n&gt;  change it to a Modern Application wasn&#39;t an option.]<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You may not realize it, but this risks creating malformed XML when your <br/>\nlibrary is used on certain IBM platforms. These things happen when you <br/>\nwrite to platform defaults that can be in active conflict with the <br/>\nrequirements of the format or protocol you&#39;re writing.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n﻿Elliotte Rusty Harold  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:elharo@...\">elharo@...</a><br/>\nXML in a Nutshell 3rd Edition Just Published!<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.cafeconleche.org/books/xian3/\">http://www.cafeconleche.org/books/xian3/</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0596007647/cafeaulaitA/ref=nosim\">http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0596007647/cafeaulaitA/ref=nosim</a></div>",
