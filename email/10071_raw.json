It will also \nwarn you if you have &#39;void testXXXX()&#39; methods that are not public.\n\nIf this is not what you want...\n\nWell, if you want to have TestCase classes with no test methods, \nbecause they&#39;re all disabled for example, then add an artifical test \nmethod that does nothing but successfully return.  This will prevent \nJUnit from complaining.  (This is a bad thing to do, but I&#39;ve been \nknown to do it, from time to time.)\n\nIf you want to use some other naming standard for test methods (and \nlord knows why you would want to do that), declare a &#39;public static \nTest suite()&#39; method in your TestCase, and build your own TestSuite.  \nSearch for &quot;Parameterized Test Case&quot; for suggestions.\n\n\n",
