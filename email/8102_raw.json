I am tackling each of these in turn and now that I have a better layout and docs I am tackling the lack for test cases. However, since these are the first junit test cases I have ever written I am getting stuck.\n&gt; \n&gt; (1) One program spawns off three threads. One thread moves files into storage, a second deletes files from storage, and the third catalogs all existing files in the storage. The problem is that each class only exposes the constructor and the run() method - so there is really not public facing methods to check. The run() goes off on its own, doing all kinds of steps using private methods, only ending upon death.\n&gt; \tSo for example, the Mover thread is checking for files in a given directory, if it finds a file it parses information from the filename to find its destination, them moves the file to that destination. Once it has finished with all of the files it sleeps for a few minutes. I would like to check all of parsing steps, but they are private only.\n&gt; \n&gt; (2) A second program relies on all of its data in a MS SQL database (connection using jdbc). Is there so way to build a fake set of tables using junit so that when run under junit it would get data from a set of objects instead of actually going to the database. That way I can provide for my own data - both bad and good - and track those results.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Chip\n&gt; -----\n&gt; Programming: Its not just a job - its an indenture \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
