I needed\n&gt; to write some tests around a user belonging to a group.\n&gt; \n&gt; I needed at a minimum an implementation of IDfUser and IDfGroup. Due to the\n&gt; nature of the beast it is most common to get these from the session\n&gt; (IDfSession). As all of these are interfaces it wasn&#39;t too bad but each of\n&gt; the interfaces extends others and have several hundred methods each. I\n&gt; eventually decided that what I was trying to test in this case was\n&gt; Documentum logic and that I should just trust the framework.\n&gt; \n&gt; Another example is Documentum web components which are similiar in some ways\n&gt; to JSF. These extend standard Documentum classes which provide a large\n&gt; amount of functionality much of which eventually ties back to a functionaing\n&gt; sql database via a custom interface and/or query language. In these cases\n&gt; the best I could do was to test extracted business logic piecemeal.\n\nI&#39;m having difficulty seeing how these statements relate to &quot;various \nmocking libraries&quot; having &quot;too many moving parts to be useful for more \nthan trivial tests&quot;. It seems the problem lies in the Documentum API and \nnot in mocking libraries. What am I missing?\n-- \nJ. B.
