This is one method you \n/want/ to test against a live database, because you are testing your \nability to read data and map it. Just make sure you have exclusive \naccess to the database.\n\nIf you find yourself wanting to do this in more than (say) three places, \nthen come back for more advice, because my answer will change.\n\n&lt;snip /&gt;\n\n\n&gt; B.Also i am using Junit to test certain functions of session beans ?\n&gt; am using a combination of the  InitialContext object \n&gt; ,javax.rmi.PortableRemoteObject.narrow method,create() method of my \n&gt; interface which extends EJBHome to create an instance of the object \n&gt; required and then testing the functions .\n&gt; Am not sure whether this an valid approach.\n\nIt&#39;s a valid approach if it works.\n\n&gt; Is there any other better approach ?\n\nAre you testing your session bean logic? If so, extract it to a separate \nclass and test it in memory. Make the session bean Too Simple to Break \nby having it do nothing but delegate to the session bean logic class. \nUse MockEJB to test the session bean.\n\n&gt; C. Can Junit be used to test getter methods which have some DB hits and \n&gt; some logic in it ?\n\nJUnit can test anything to which a Java interface is available.\n\n&gt;     Is it in conformance with Junit philosophy ?\n\nIs it in conformance with the philosophy of Good Design?
