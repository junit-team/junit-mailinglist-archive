Rainsberger wrote:\n&gt; Cedric Beust wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Real code relies on dependencies all the time:\n&gt; &gt; \n[...]\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; - This method can only be invoked if such field has been \n&gt; initialized.\n&gt; \n&gt; All objects should be in a &quot;sane&quot; state all the time. If not, \n&gt; then the \n&gt; design could be improved to avoid this problem. The Pragmatic \n&gt; Programmers call what you describe as &quot;Programming by Coincidence&quot;.\n&gt; \n\n&quot;Sane state&quot; does NOT mean that everything can be done to the object at\nevery time. Cedric&#39;s &quot;initialized&quot; example is probably actually a design\nflaw, but for other states, it makes of course much sense to disallow\ncertain operations: If a database connection is not open, you cannot\nexecute a select; if a file has been deleted, it cannot be deleted a\nsecond time; a bill that has been cancelled cannot be invoiced; etc.etc.\nIn many cases I saw and see, programmers/designers/architects seem to\nbelieve that the String class (where you can indeed execute every method\nsensibly at every time) is the paradigmatic example of a class. Nothing\ncan be further from the truth: Many classes have an &quot;interesting state\ndiagram&quot;, where certain operations can only be invoked if certain\nconditions hold.\n\n[...]\n&gt; &gt; - A certain object can only be created if a previous object \n&gt; has been created\n&gt; &gt; before.\n&gt; \n&gt; If so, then the previous object should be the only thing that \n&gt; can create \n&gt; the new object!\n\nThis is often contrary to design concepts with somewhat centralized\nresponsibilities. For example, if you look at the UML metamodel, an\nassociation is a thing &quot;between two (or more) classes&quot; - so an\nassociation (e.g. in an UML tool) can only be created when the classes\n(e.g. class &quot;icons&quot;) are there. Obviously, the order of the class\n(&quot;icon&quot;) creation is not important - but both must be there. Usually,\none does not design this by giving the &quot;icons&quot; the responsibility of\ncreating the association (even in this case, the creating &quot;icon&quot; must\ncheck whether the other one exists), but has a central &quot;association\ncreation tool&quot; which checks for the existence of the necessary icons.\n\nStill, on a more general level - e.g. when one talks about closely tied\ngroups of classes (yes: they are there; not even one of the tutorials\nthat explain JUnit pretends that litterally everything makes sense to be\nmocked) - the guidelines hinted at by JBR do make sense.\n\nRegards\nHarald M.
