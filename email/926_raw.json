I should have named my class\nTestFixtureForPackage--is that a large enough comment?  ;)\n\nWhat I&#39;m trying to do is create one fixture that is reused for all my test\ncases in the package I&#39;m working on.  I thought TestSetup would be the class\nfor this, but it seems like simply creating a parent TestCase class is the\nway to go.\n\nI was confusing the functionality of running setUp() once versus having a\nreusable fixture.\n\nMan does it feel late ...\n\n&gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; From: Chas Schley [mailto:chas@...]\n&gt; Sent: Friday, April 06, 2001 4:08 PM\n&gt; To: junit@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Subject: Re: [junit] JUnit FAQ TestSetup example\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Questions below, answers immediately following, rest of \n&gt; original message\n&gt; appended.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; (1) Is there a better way?\n&gt; &gt; (2) Will the variables defined in oneTimeSetup be in scope \n&gt; inside MyTest?\n&gt; &gt; (3) How can I reuse the fixture defined in this class for \n&gt; another set of\n&gt; &gt; tests?\n&gt; &gt; (4) Will the fixtures defined the suite&#39;s TestCase&#39;s still \n&gt; be created?\n&gt; \n&gt; 1) Yes, comment your code ;)  Seriously, a better way to \n&gt; what?  What is it\n&gt; that you seek to accomplish?  If, as the name AllTests \n&gt; implies, this test is\n&gt; simply plumbing to run all of your tests, then you don&#39;t need \n&gt; a fixture.\n&gt; You can remove the TestSuite wrapper and the oneTimeSetUp and\n&gt; oneTimeTearDown methods.  Simply have your suite() method return the\n&gt; TestSuite to which you have added your tests, not the \n&gt; TestSetup wrapper.\n&gt; 2) Variables declared in a method are scoped to that method, \n&gt; so they are out\n&gt; of scope outside of the method.  Class that inherit from the \n&gt; class in which\n&gt; your (public or protected) method is defined have acces to \n&gt; the method (and\n&gt; therefore the effects of the variable), but the variable is \n&gt; still scoped to\n&gt; the method and not beyond.\n&gt; 3) If you remove the TestSetup wrapper, then you won&#39;t have a \n&gt; fixture to\n&gt; reuse in other classes.  At my company, I created a zTestCase \n&gt; class that\n&gt; extends TestCase.  In my class, I define a generic fixture, \n&gt; and provide\n&gt; convenience methods for manipulating that fixture.  All of \n&gt; our tests (all\n&gt; those that need the fixture) extend zTestCase.  That way, our \n&gt; tests leverage\n&gt; the fixture in their supers, and override oneTimeSetUp if \n&gt; they need to alter\n&gt; the generic fixture.\n&gt; 4) Yes, unless their oneTimeSetUp overrides the setUp method, \n&gt; in which case,\n&gt; no.  Again, it depends on what you seek to accomplish.\n&gt; \n&gt; Hope that helps,\n&gt; \n&gt; _chas_\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; From: &quot;Mark Bucciarelli&quot; &lt;mbucciarelli@...&gt;\n&gt; &gt; To: &lt;junit@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Sent: Friday, April 06, 2001 12:17 PM\n&gt; &gt; Subject: RE: [junit] JUnit FAQ TestSetup example\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; I also found the FAQ confusing on this point.  I&#39;m sure \n&gt; it&#39;s my ignorance\n&gt; of\n&gt; &gt; Java that causes me not to follow your helpful reply.  \n&gt; Here&#39;s a class (and\n&gt; a\n&gt; &gt; few questions below):\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;     public class AllTests extends TestCase\n&gt; &gt;     {\n&gt; &gt;       public AllTests(String name) { super(name); }\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;       public static Test suite()\n&gt; &gt;       {\n&gt; &gt;         TestSuite suite = new TestSuite();\n&gt; &gt;         suite.add(MyTest.suite());\n&gt; &gt;         suite.add(MyOtherTest.suite());\n&gt; &gt;         TestSetup wrapper= new TestSetup(suite)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;             public void setUp()\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;               oneTimeSetUp();\n&gt; &gt;             }\n&gt; &gt;             public void tearDown()\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;               oneTimeTearDown();\n&gt; &gt;             }\n&gt; &gt;           };\n&gt; &gt;         return wrapper;\n&gt; &gt;       }\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;       public void oneTimeSetup()\n&gt; &gt;       {\n&gt; &gt;       }\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;       public void oneTimeTearDown()\n&gt; &gt;       {\n&gt; &gt;       }\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;     }\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ------------------------ Yahoo!
