An end-to-end test is a test that tests the s=\r\nystem from outside.\n&gt;  &quot;Edge-to-edge&quot; might be a better term because most s=\r\nystems don&#39;t have\n&gt; &quot;front&quot; and &quot;back&quot; ends.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;End-to-end&quot; also applies=\r\n to the development process.  I like my\n&gt; end-to-end test run to build the =\r\nsystem from source into deployable\n&gt; packages and automatically deploy thos=\r\ne into a production-like\n&gt; environment in the same way as a real production=\r\n release.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;  2) I was thinking TDD is only used to develop functionali=\r\nty by\nwriting\n&gt; &gt;  unit tests first and then the code, can it be more gener=\r\nic to apply\n&gt; &gt;  for functional testing ?\n&gt; \n&gt; In TDD you drive all develop=\r\nment with tests.  So, if you want the\n&gt; system to have a feature you first =\r\nwrite a test that demonstrates that\n&gt; the system doesn&#39;t have that feature.=\r\n  You then work out which classes\n&gt; need to be be added/modified and do tho=\r\nse changes by repeatedly\n&gt; writing unit-tests, implementing the code, refac=\r\ntoring, and deciding\n&gt; the next change to make, until eventually the end-to=\r\n-end test passes.\n&gt; You then write another end-to-end test.\n&gt; \n&gt; End-to-end=\r\n tests give you most feedback about the system&#39;s external\n&gt; quality.  Unit =\r\ntests give you most feedback about the system&#39;s\n&gt; internal quality.  They a=\r\nlso allow you to maximise branch coverage by\n&gt; running fast (so you can exe=\r\nrcise the code with many different input\n&gt; values) and letting you inject f=\r\naults (by making mock objects throw\n&gt; exceptions that are hard to cause in =\r\na real system).\n&gt; \n&gt; In my experience you need both.  System tests tell you=\r\n when the system\n&gt; has stopped working.  Unit tests narrow down precisely w=\r\nhere the fault\n&gt; has been introduced.\n&gt; \n&gt; As the system gets larger, you m=\r\nay use subsystem tests that cover\n&gt; coarse-grained components like servers,=\r\n MDBs, etc. However, I have\n&gt; found those only necessary in systems that we=\r\nre not originally written\n&gt; with TDD.  In systems that were written from th=\r\ne start with TDD,\n&gt; components are usually loosely coupled enough to let yo=\r\nu run\n&gt; subsystems in a unit-test fixture.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;  3) I need to understand =\r\nmore on this &#39;end-to-end&#39; testing, are there\n&gt; &gt;  any tools available ? or =\r\nI should rely on the build process for\n&gt; &gt;  executing all the test cases fo=\r\nr me?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  Actually, I&#39;ve been started using unit-testing tools like Ju=\r\nnit\n&gt; &gt;  recently for the newly added API in our product but rest of the co=\r\nde\n&gt; &gt;  is pretty much legacy in nature. So, i was wondering are there any\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;  tools for doing this end-to-end testing ? just like Junit ?\n&gt; \n&gt; I use=\r\n JUnit and a lot of helper code and support libraries to run\n&gt; end-to-end t=\r\nests and have the automated build run all the tests, unit\n&gt; tests and end-t=\r\no-end tests.  There are many tools for testing\n&gt; applications end to end, l=\r\nike GUI automation tools, but I&#39;ve not found\n&gt; them to fit into a TDD proce=\r\nss very well.\n&gt; \n&gt; --Nat\n&gt;\n\n\n\n",
