When in doubt, leave it out. You can always put it in again <br/>\nlater, but the opposite is not true. Do not offer people flexibility <br/>\nthey did not ask for, and may not need. Do as little as you can get away <br/>\nwith. This principle makes both the library developers&#39; and the users&#39; <br/>\nlives easier. Options are not free.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s not as if the library is fixed in stone and nothing can ever be <br/>\nadded to it. If someone thinks of something you hadn&#39;t thought of, add <br/>\nit.
