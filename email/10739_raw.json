The problem I have is on the first\n&gt; failure, the tests\n&gt; &gt; discontinues and the rest of the array is not\n&gt; checked.  This makes\n&gt; &gt; sense because of the exception that is thrown and\n&gt; handled by JUNIT.\n&gt; &gt; Is there a away I can keep the loop running until\n&gt; it finishes all the\n&gt; &gt; strings.  I can catch the exception but how do I\n&gt; add it to the\n&gt; &gt; current aggregate test results that JUNIT is\n&gt; keeping track of.  Also,\n&gt; &gt; is this the best way or proper way to do this?  I\n&gt; don&#39;t think it\n&gt; &gt; makes very much sense to write a test method for\n&gt; each string in the\n&gt; &gt; arry, it wouldn&#39;t be very scalable or dynamic. \n&gt; Thanks in advance for\n&gt; &gt; any help or advice. \n&gt; \n&gt; I think you could write a test *suite* for this.\n&gt; Perhaps something along\n&gt; the lines of\n&gt; \n&gt;  public class FooTest extends TestCase {\n&gt; \n&gt;    public FooTest(int testValue) {\n&gt;      this.testValue = testValue;\n&gt;    }\n&gt; \n&gt;    public void testBar() {\n&gt;      assertEquals(..., myFoo.bar(testValue));\n&gt;    }\n&gt; \n&gt;    public static Test suite() {\n&gt;      TestSuite suite = new TestSuite();\n&gt;      for ...\n&gt;        suite.addTest(new FooTest(i));\n&gt;      }\n&gt;      return suite;\n&gt;    }\n&gt;   }\n&gt; \n&gt; ???\n&gt; \n&gt; Take care, Ilja\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
