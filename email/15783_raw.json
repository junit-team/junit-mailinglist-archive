An extension to JUnit will likely define a custom \n&gt; subclass of R=\r\nunner.\n&gt; - Plan.  Each Runner must report a Plan, a hierarchical tree \n&gt; of=\r\n the names of the tests it will run.  Test events are \n&gt; reported with resp=\r\nect to leaves in this tree.\n&gt; - Request.  A Request is a specification of t=\r\nhe desired tests \n&gt; to be run.  Extensions may also define custom subclasse=\r\ns of \n&gt; Request, in order to, for example, read tests to be run out \n&gt; of a=\r\nn XML file--if you think that&#39;s a good idea. :-)\n\nThis sounds very useful. =\r\nIt&#39;s a real pain that I don&#39;t have much\ntime to look at properly it at the =\r\nmoment, though I&#39;ll do what I can.\n\nIn particular, when writing my own para=\r\nmeterisation which allowed\nparameterisation on a per test-method basis, I k=\r\nept running into this\nkind of issue, in terms of how I&#39;d &quot;explain&quot; to a uni=\r\nt test UI what was\ngoing to be run etc.\n\nUnfortunately I can&#39;t (currently) =\r\nrelease the source of my\ninvestigations, but I&#39;ll try to apply the code I&#39;d=\r\n written to the new\nRunner/Plan/Request architecture and let you know how I=\r\n get on.\n\nJon\n\n\nClearswift monitors, controls and protects all its messagin=\r\ng traffic in compliance with its corporate email policy using Clearswift pr=\r\noducts.\nFind out more about Clearswift, its solutions and services at http:=\r\n//www.clearswift.com\n\nThis communication is confidential and may contain pr=\r\nivileged information intended solely for the named addressee(s).
