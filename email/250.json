But at<br/>\nsome point it must be used by an actual intended-to-be-public public method.<br/>\nOnce that public method has been built and tested, we can change the<br/>\nmodifier of the supposed-to-be-private method to private.  That means we<br/>\nhave to remove/comment out the tests that explicitly accessed it: we know<br/>\nthe private method is still working properly because the public method(s)<br/>\nthat use it still run green.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe can&#39;t keep all our tests; many of them are just scaffolding to help build<br/>\nprograms.  Once they&#39;re of no more use we should discard them.  This is the<br/>\nsort of refactoring of the test suites required to run all our tests in less<br/>\nthan 10 mins.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWe certainly shouldn&#39;t violate the structure of our code just to run some<br/>\ntests.  Of course using reflection to get at the private methods is a<br/>\ndifferent kettle of fish and sounds like a neat way around the problem for<br/>\nthose cases when we really need to test the private method directly.  Didn&#39;t<br/>\nsomeone say they were going to post some code? ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nregards, APC<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jakob@...\">jakob@...</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jakob@...\">jakob@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: 15 January 2001 23:52<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@egroups.com\">junit@egroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [junit] Re: test with private methd<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHi There.<br/>\n<br/>\nVery often you don&#39;t need methods to be &quot;private&quot; to protect them <br/>\nfrom being called from the outside, but &quot;protected&quot; will do the job, <br/>\nallowing access only to the class + subclasses of it. <br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s then some simple suggestions:<br/>\n<br/>\nA.1) Create a subclass of the class you want to test. Put this class <br/>\nin your test package.<br/>\n<br/>\nA.2) Create a simple delegation method in the subclass with public <br/>\naccess that calls the protected method. You can also put this method <br/>\ndirectly in the class you want to test, and just remove it before <br/>\nreleasing. This causes a lot of out commenting though :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd something I sometimes do before testing smaller areas...<br/>\n<br/>\nB.1) change the method access to public for the duration of the test. <br/>\nThen change it back to private. This also gives some problems in, <br/>\nthat you cannot execute automatic tests.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIf these suggestions won&#39;t do, I see no other way than looking into <br/>\nwhat reflection might do for you.<br/>\n<br/>\nRegards,<br/>\nJakob Jenkov<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nTo unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit-unsubscribe@egroups.com\">junit-unsubscribe@egroups.com</a></div>",
