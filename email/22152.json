Most<br/>\ndevelopers have experience already about tests they should have<br/>\nwritten: they&#39;re the tests that would have prevented the bugs that<br/>\nhave hurt you worst.  As you get more experienced, the maxim of &quot;test<br/>\nuntil fear turns to boredom&quot; is wise.  If you have a good<br/>\ntest-coverage tool, that can help generate fear, when you ask yourself<br/>\n&quot;I don&#39;t have a single unit test running this method.  Am I OK with<br/>\nthat?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of my personal favorite ways to bootstrap experience is<br/>\ntest-driven development: every time all your tests pass, and you&#39;re<br/>\nsatisfied with the design of your code so far, write a test for your<br/>\nnext feature, which will break, and then make it pass.<br/>\n<br/>\nDoes that help?<br/>\n<br/>\n   David Saff<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Wed, Dec 9, 2009 at 6:21 AM, loicmidy &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:loicmidy@...\">loicmidy@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; Hello,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I have read severals books about Junit.

The question which unit test to do is as important as the question how to do unit test because if we don&#39;t do the good unit tests then the ROI will be low (or even negative) and the practice won&#39;t last long within the programmers teams.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; yours sincerely<br/>\n&gt; loïc midy<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Yahoo!
