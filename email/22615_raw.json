So you\nuse JUnit in an uncommon way for an uncommon task, at le=\r\nast as JUnit\nis concerned.\nBTW: JUnit stops execution of a test-method on t=\r\nhe first error.\nIt then continues with the next test in the suite.\n\nYou mig=\r\nht want to take a look at TestNG. There you can do more in\nterms of orderin=\r\ng tests.\n\nAnd besides, you might need to think about what is a test for you=\r\n and\nhow do you program that with JUnit or alike.\nIt might be better to act=\r\nually build one test method in JUnit that\nalso corresponds to one of your t=\r\nests, so you align the continue/stop\nbehaviour of junit with what suites yo=\r\nur needs.\n\nGreetings,\n   Malte\n\nOn 15 April 2010 15:05, yvesd.public &lt;yvesd=\r\n.public@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Hello dear JUnit community.\n&gt;\n&gt; My name is Yves=\r\n Dessertine and I am new to JUnit. I have a question about good practises i=\r\nn JUnit.\n&gt;\n&gt; First of all, we plan to use JUnit to do integration testing (=\r\nin our case, to test complete test scenarios).
