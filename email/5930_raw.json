This was based on some last minute ideas we had and chose to\n&gt;document shortly before release. We then had the choice of either providing\n&gt;a link to JUnitPerf or providing the distribution itself. It seemed like it\n&gt;would be more convenient for our customers to actually provide the JUnitPerf\n&gt;distribution itself, and it was fairly small so we chose to do that.\n&gt;\n&gt;This decision was made at the last minute when we were putting together our\n&gt;own distribution. Had the thought occurred to us earlier we might have\n&gt;contacted you first, but it didn&#39;t and we didn&#39;t and for that I apologize.\n&gt;Had I had any inkling that it would have caused you or anyone else the\n&gt;slightest mental distress, I would have done everything in my power to\n&gt;prevent that. Again, I didn&#39;t get any indication that you were at all\n&gt;disappointed in our correspondence last July but it might have been there\n&gt;and I just didn&#39;t pick up on it.\n&gt;\n&gt;In the next release, we will take out the JUnitPerf distribution and just\n&gt;provide a link to your web site. That will also settle the question of\n&gt;whether our customers have access to the very latest JUnitPerf code, which\n&gt;solves a problem for me.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\nFair enough.  \n\nThanks for clarifying your intentions!\n\nMike\n\n-- \nMike Clark\nClarkware Consulting Inc.\nhttp://www.clarkware.com \n\n\n\n\n",
