Apologies for unclear writing (perhaps,\n&gt; &gt;unclear thinking ...)\n&gt;\n&gt; It happens.\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;I want to write a method M which given a class C which is supposed\n&gt; &gt;to implement interface I will return a suite which runs the abstract test\n&gt; &gt;cases ATC for I with respect to the implementation C. I happens to be\n&gt; &gt;Graph and the C&#39;s are implementations of Graph and there are enough\n&gt; &gt;C&#39;s that writing out explicit subclasses of ATC for each C is a pain.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;This makes it easy for the writers of the different C&#39;s to run the\n&gt; &gt;abstract test cases.\n&gt;\n&gt; With the greatest love and respect, that first sentence does not appear to\n&gt; be English. \n\nIt&#39;s English. Perhaps rather more tersely punctuated than desirable for easy\nparsing ...\n\n&gt; You have an abstract test case AbstractTestGraph. There are a bunch of\n&gt; implementations (subclasses) of Graph. You want to be able to generate on\n&gt; the fly test cases for each implementation (subclass) of Graph.\n\nYes. Specifically I don&#39;t want to have to write out essentially the same code\nonce for each test subclass; the concrete test class differ only in their names\n(incidental, although useful when they fail ...) and in the class of object they\ninstantiate (some subclass of Graph).\n\n&gt; If that is what you want, then it shouldn&#39;t be that hard. Create a\n&gt; TestSuite object consisting of dynamic subclasses of AbstractTestGraph,\n&gt; each of which overrides makeGraph() to answer its particular implementation\n&gt; of Graph. As I wrote, dynamic invocation handlers should do the job.\n\nIt&#39;s generating those dynamic subclasses of AbstractTestGraph that&#39;s the\nproblem for me. Am I missing something in the reflection API? \n\n&gt; &gt;What&#39;s important is not to be able to create a suite of them all (although\n&gt; &gt;that might be nice), but to be able to trivially able to create a suite\n&gt; &gt; for each one to be plugged into the locally appropriate test-cases.\n&gt;\n&gt; You want to generate code? or generate the implementation at runtime?\n\nThe latter - as an implementation of &quot;write concise code which does the\njob&quot;.\n\n&gt; &gt;[When I say &quot;suite&quot; am I being sloppy? I really mean &quot;a test that runs\n&gt; &gt;lots of tests&quot;.]\n&gt;\n&gt; Tests don&#39;t run tests. TestRunners run tests.\n\nI really mean &quot;a test that when run results in the running of lots of tests.&quot;\n\n&gt; &gt;So far as I can tell, it would be easy in Java if classes nested inside\n&gt; &gt;methods\n&gt; &gt;were allowed to be public. I suspect the restriction was not reviewed when\n&gt; &gt;they added reflection to the official language ...\n&gt;\n&gt; They are if they are class-level (static).\n\nYes, but then they&#39;re not nested inside methods, which rather loses the point\nof parametisation. Hmm. Perhaps I&#39;m missing a trick with non-static inner\nclasses. (The trouble with dynamic inner classes being that their constructors\nwon&#39;t match the pattern expected by junit ...)\n\nWill cogitate. Much other stuff to do as well. Thanks for prodding.\n\n-- \nChris &quot;electric hedgehog&quot; Dollin\nC FAQs at: http://www.faqs.org/faqs/by-newsgroup/comp/comp.lang.c.html\nC welcome: http://www.angelfire.com/ms3/bchambless0/welcome_to_clc.html\n\n",
