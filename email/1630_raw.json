My development team depends on JUnit.  I&#39;d\n&gt; rather have fewer new features that are well designed and developed\n&gt; than many features that are poorly designed and implemented.\n&gt;\n&gt; - If you are going to transfer control to the community, why\n&gt; not &quot;Community Planning Game&quot;.  That is, implement the XP Planning\n&gt; Game where the community is the customer.  The community could\n&gt; express what they desire (stories) and set priorities.\n&gt;\n&gt; - Providing hooks for extensions would be great.  Right now, the most\n&gt; frequently use hook is subclassing.  Unfortunately this makes it\n&gt; difficult to use two extensions at once.\n&gt;\n&gt; - Greg\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In junit@y..., &quot;Johannes Link&quot; &lt;john.link@g...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; 2. JUnit as a political gesture celebrates the ability of\n&gt; programmers\n&gt; &gt; &gt; to test their own software. The code and tests must be held to a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; higher standard, to demonstrate the techniques necessary to uphold\n&gt; &gt; &gt; our end of the bargain.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;d like to add two aspects:\n&gt; &gt; - JUnit should be the stable angle for the very unstable projects\n&gt; we all\n&gt; &gt; have to do. Changing too much jeopardizes stableness.\n&gt; &gt; - When adding too much non-core functionality one quickly looses\n&gt; focus of\n&gt; &gt; the core parts. Very often the extra functionality is not exactly\n&gt; what I\n&gt; &gt; need in a specific situation, so I have to reimplement it anyway.\n&gt; If the\n&gt; &gt; unneeded and unwanted part of a tool is prevailing many will move\n&gt; towards\n&gt; &gt; starting from scratch with a new (small) framework. That&#39;s why I&#39;d\n&gt; rather\n&gt; &gt; have JUnit as a core with hooks to plug in additional behaviour\n&gt; which is\n&gt; &gt; available in additional tools.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; BTW, is the move to version 4 as described in\n&gt; &gt; http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?JunitNextRelease\n&gt; &gt; an &quot;official&quot; thing, i.e. promoted by Kent and Erich?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Johannes\n&gt;\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
