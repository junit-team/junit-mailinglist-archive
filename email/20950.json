I am new to JUnit annotations.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have a need to execute a set of classic account registration tests:   <br/>\nregister a user by [email, password], verify that that succeeds, then  <br/>\nimmediately follow this with an identical registration with the same  <br/>\n[email, password], which should fail because the account already  <br/>\nexists.  This is a specific case of a more general scenario where the  <br/>\nfirst test develops state the second test needs to know about.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt occurred to me to use a single test class, containing two @Test- <br/>\ndecorated methods:  register() and dupRegister().  The problem with  <br/>\nthis structure is that I found no documentation that indicates that  <br/>\nthe first decorated test method is executed after the second decorated  <br/>\ntest method.  I also considered using the Parameter annotation, with  <br/>\nduplicate [email, password] provided as the parameter list.  While  <br/>\nthat could drive the tests, I see no way of indicating in this scheme  <br/>\nthat the first test invocation should succeed, while the second should  <br/>\nfail.<br/>\n<br/>\nWould someone be kind enough to sketch a reasonable, &quot;JUnit way&quot; to  <br/>\napproach this.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks.</div>",
