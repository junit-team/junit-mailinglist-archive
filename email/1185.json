There is lot of dependencies between the<br/>\nclasses.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn one place it is creating objects. How to write test case to verify<br/>\nthat created object is wrong or right?<br/>\n<br/>\nIn run time they are writing data into database, passing to various<br/>\nobjects. We need to write test cases for all these. Creating objects and<br/>\nso on. Is it worth writing test cases for this sort of scenario?  I am<br/>\nthinking that doing black box testing is better than writing JUnit test<br/>\ncases.<br/>\n<br/>\nregards,<br/>\nBhavani.</div>",
