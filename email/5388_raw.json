BaseTestRunner is the thing \nthat looks for the existence of a suite() method in a test.  If you \ncreate a TestSuite and pass a class that has a suite() method, the \nsuite() method is ignored and all the textXXX() methods are iterated \nto generate the suite.\n\nIs this intentional behavior?  I would think that TestSuite would be \nthe thing that looks for a suite() method.\n\nBoris\n\n\n\n\n",
