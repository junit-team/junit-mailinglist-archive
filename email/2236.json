The method is designed as &quot;validate this thing, if ok, let it<br/>\npass, if not throw a ValidationException).<br/>\nYou can find tons of method like that in the real world.<br/>\n(for example, :<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://java.sun.com/products/jdk/1.2/docs/api/java/security/AccessController\">http://java.sun.com/products/jdk/1.2/docs/api/java/security/AccessController</a><br/>\n.html#checkPermission(java.security.Permission)  )<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Of course, I assume that you prefer not to have an unsuccessful validation<br/>\n&gt;register as an error.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Why not? Your code below lacks the stack trace for debugging (A<br/>\nfail(Throwable) would probably be usefull here). Letting the error go all<br/>\nthe way up to the junit framework let me write even simpler tests. To me,<br/>\nit&#39;s the simplet thing that could work. I don&#39;t think it makes them hard to<br/>\nread, I got used pretty fast to the fact that if something throws inside a<br/>\ntest, the test will fail. I know other people on this list also work that<br/>\nway. This enable me to spend less time writing tests, and more time focusing<br/>\non what counts : what should I test and how to implement it. I don&#39;t like<br/>\nwriting asssertTrue(true) or lines like that, because I think they will<br/>\nconfuse the person who reads the code, like somebody else said. My tests are<br/>\nalways very simple: a couple of lines. Only basic understanding of how junit<br/>\nworks is needed in order to understand them. Yes, a validation error will<br/>\nshow as an error and not a failure in the runner. I personnaly don&#39;t make<br/>\nany difference between those 2. The unit test passed or it busted. If it&#39;s<br/>\nan error, it just indicates to me that an exception was thrown (other than<br/>\nAssertionFailedError) from the test method.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;try {<br/>\n&gt;    validate();<br/>\n&gt;}<br/>\n&gt;catch (ValidationException oops) {<br/>\n&gt;    fail(oops.toString());<br/>\n&gt;}<br/>\n&gt;Remember, folks: fail() is an assertion! Look at the code.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Of course it does!:)<br/>\nI agree with Robert saying :<br/>\n&quot;So, code that dyamically counts assertions will count the above as having<br/>\nno assertions if it passes.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThis would then be a &quot;false warning&quot;. Unless you are talking about static<br/>\nanaylis which I doubt. Please correct me if this is the case.<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess we just have a slightly different way of writing tests. Writing<br/>\ncompact tests look like obsfucation to some people while putting lot of<br/>\ndetails can look like... obsfucation to some other.  :)<br/>\n<br/>\nmathieu<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: J.

Rainsberger<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSent: Saturday, July 28, 2001 11:49 AM<br/>\nSubject: [junit] False warnings? (Re: re - assert counting)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;re - assert countingFrom: Keith Ray<br/>\n&gt; &gt;As I said before, I would just want a warning when a test method is empty<br/>\n&gt;or has no asserts...<br/>\n&gt; &gt; but I don&#39;t want to go to the trouble of getting some code-coverage tool<br/>\n&gt;working.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Interesting. But in my case I would have a lot of &quot;false warnings&quot; because<br/>\n&gt;I<br/>\n&gt;have a lot of methods that validate something and throw if it&#39;s invalid<br/>\n&gt;(but<br/>\n&gt;do nothing if valid, so return is void). The tests look like that :<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;public void testAValidationTest() throws Exception {<br/>\n&gt;     validator.validate(VALID_DATA);<br/>\n&gt;}<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;So, no asserts, but a perfectly valid test case.<br/>\n<br/>\nI disagree. Wouldn&#39;t method validate(DataObject) have to either return a<br/>\nboolean or perform the assertion itself? In the first case, you&#39;d have to<br/>\nwrite assertTrue(validator.validate()), or otherwise the assertTrue() would<br/>\nbe inside the method validate(). Either way, you&#39;re performing at least one<br/>\nassert.<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course, I assume that you prefer not to have an unsuccessful validation<br/>\nregister as an error. In the last case, you&#39;d write<br/>\n<br/>\ntry {<br/>\n    validate();<br/>\n}<br/>\ncatch (ValidationException oops) {<br/>\n    fail(oops.toString());<br/>\n}<br/>\n<br/>\nRemember, folks: fail() is an assertion!
