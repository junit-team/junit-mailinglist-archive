So to me it looks ready for release.<br/>\n <br/>\n One thing that was slightly<br/>\n annoying is that instead of removing<br/>\n org.junit.internal.AssumptionViolatedException, you&#39;ve<br/>\n deprecated and duplicated it into<br/>\n org.junit.AssumptionViolatedException. This caused me some<br/>\n headache as we had code catching the former class type and<br/>\n suddenly it looked like assumptions had stopped working<br/>\n until I realized I had to change the import statement. For<br/>\n the future, I&#39;d prefer that you just remove the original<br/>\n class as then we&#39;ll get a compiler error instead of<br/>\n runtime failures.<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n Thanks for the feedback,<br/>\n Chris<br/>\n Could you give<br/>\n us an example of the code that was broken by our<br/>\n introduction of an external AssumptionViolatedException? The<br/>\n new external one is a subclass of the internal one, so the<br/>\n thinking was any code outside of JUnit that tried to catch<br/>\n the internal AssumptionViolatedException would still catch<br/>\n exceptions thrown by Assume. Was your code specifically<br/>\n throwing the internal AssumptionViolatedException? I thought<br/>\n we handled that as well.<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n I would be very interested<br/>\n in knowing more details.<br/>\n -- Kevin<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n-----<br/>\n(yahoo seems to mangle my reply, sorry for bad formatting)<br/>\nHi,<br/>\n<br/>\nto some extent, I think it was the fault of our code using it, which seems overly restrictive:<br/>\nif (&lt;something&gt; && exception.getClass().equals(org.junit.internal.AssumptionViolatedException.class))<br/>\n<br/>\nI never checked when is actually thrown, but if it is the internal one that gets here, then of course that statement is too restrictive. I don&#39;t know if there was some reason for doing it that way or not, though. Easy to work around, though ;)<br/>\nWe were also throwing the &quot;internal exception&quot; in some of our unit tests so I changed those to the external one, but I don&#39;t know if that gave me any problems or not.<br/>\n     <br/>\nBy the way, the removal of &quot;exit()&quot; from JUnitSystem was a bit annoying as I ended having to copy in MainRunner (from your tests) into our project as we&#39;re also testing some System.exit conditions. I can see why it is nicer to remove a test-only API from the source part, but when the cost is 290 lines of MainRunner to save JUnitSystem subclasses from writing a 3-line method, then I&#39;m not so sure it is a gain. But I can live with it. </span></blockquote></div>",
