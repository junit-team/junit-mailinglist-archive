In the tested class &quot;new<br/>\nDate() &quot; returns always the current date and not the one which I set<br/>\nin my JUnit test.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have test data for business logic which I create before the test<br/>\nstarts and which contain absolute dates like 2004-12-31. So I need to<br/>\nmodify the system date for my tests.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I need to test is calculation of the average sold quantity. But<br/>\nonly the last X weeks (from today) need to be considered. My test<br/>\nsales data contains dates like 2004-12-31. Its much easier for me to<br/>\nwrite and understand data with such &quot;absolute&quot; dates instead of<br/>\nrelative dates (by rolling the dates around and not understanding it<br/>\nquickly). So it would be good for me to simply set the system date<br/>\nbefore the test starts and thus use absolute dates for my tests<br/>\ninstead of relative ones.<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course I could make the dates of the test data relative, but that<br/>\nwould be harder to code, understand and to maintain. It better for me<br/>\nto change the system time. But it needs to be done programatically in<br/>\nthe JUnit test and not manually by changing the OS date by hand.<br/>\n<br/>\nCan you provide a solution for that please?</div>",
