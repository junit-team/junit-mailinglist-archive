The first method would be called before the \ntesting is started. The second method he wants to call after testing \nis finished.\n\nWhat he wants is to do in makeTestData() is to write test data into \nthe database for testing purposes. So he thinks we don&#39;t need Mock \nobjects.\n\nWe are not experienced both. But I read a lot of Mock objects.\n\nHe also objects that the JUnit testing would be done only with Mock \nobjects.\n\nWhat do you think? Is it better to use Mock objects or to do it like \nmy coworker wants?\n\n\n\n",
