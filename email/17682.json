The library <br/>\nsupplied by the vendor presented an API that contained only non-virtual <br/>\nfunctions.  The code that used the library could not be tested because <br/>\nthere was no way to make sure that it was making the right calls. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe ended up wrapping the entire API so that we could mock it.  If the <br/>\nvendor had made the functions virtual, or at least supplied mocking <br/>\npoints, we would have been saved a lot of trouble.  But, the thing is,  <br/>\nAPI vendors just don&#39;t think about these things.  I used a DOM parsing <br/>\nlibrary a few months ago which, by all appearances, didn&#39;t let you <br/>\ncreate a document in memory.  You had to either point it to a URL or the <br/>\ndisk.  So, to write tests that could otherwise easily be written in <br/>\nmemory, you needed either a server or a scattering of files on disk.<br/>\n<br/>\nAPI designers just don&#39;t seem to think about testing.<br/>\n<br/>\nMichael Feathers<br/>\nwww.objectmentor.com</div>",
