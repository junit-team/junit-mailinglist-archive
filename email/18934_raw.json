I solely refer to the writing of unit tests.\n&gt; Later saving of time (by better code) shouldn&#39;t be considered. So\n&gt; what&#39;s your experience? Can anybody do a statement about time\n&gt; consumption of writing unit tests?\n\n\nIt&#39;s easy to quantify:  How much time do you want to spend?\n\nI&quot;ve found that it&#39;s impossible to write unit tests for everything after the\nfact, without changing the existing code to make it testable.  Usually there\nis a module that is so tangled with dependencies that nothing can be tested\nin isolation (or a reasonable facisimile thereof).\n\nWhen you run into one of these tangles, you&#39;re faced with a few choices:\n\n1) Decouple the code to make it testable.\n2) Write some kind of integration / acceptance test that verifies the inputs\n/ outputs.  Abandon the unit tests for the dependencies.\n3) Ignore that section of the code entirely (This is too hard, and I have a\ndeadline to meet!)\n\nEvery time I run into this situation, I want to choose #1.  If the code I&#39;m\nworking on doesn&#39;t require me to change the internals, I might fall back to\n#2 in order to meet my deadline.  I used to fall back to #3 all too often.\nToday I believe that is unprofessional.\n\nWhen you&#39;re estimating how much time you need to spend retrofitting unit\ntests, you have to decide which of those options you&#39;re comfortable with.\nRun some code metrics to determine how tangled the code base is.  Look at\nsome of the more important classes to determine how easy the code is to\nunderstand.  I&#39;d take those three elements, add in a dash of what experience\ntells me, and then provide a buffer based on the thoroughness of the final\nresult.\n\nCheers!\nCarl\n\n-- \nhttp://genomescampaigns.blogspot.com\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n",
