Every published \nmethod you add to a class increases the difficulty of learning that \nclass more than linearly. Giving everyone everything they might possibly \nneed creates baroque APIs that are extremely difficult to learn and use. \nKISS applies.\n\nIf someone presents a valid, not-too-weird use case that requires \nexposing a protected method, then by all means make the method \nprotected. But don&#39;t make everything protected just because you think \nsomeone, somewhere might one day want to use it. If the sheer size of \nthe resulting classes doesn&#39;t seem reason enough, then consider that you \nprobably haven&#39;t designed the method correctly for extension in the \nfirst place. Methods provided in advance of an actual use case are \nunlikely to fit the use cases that do arise.\n\n&gt; While I sympathize with the idea of keeping as much private as possible, I\n&gt; am also a bit bothered by the patronizing feeling behind it.   Developers\n&gt; don&#39;t need baby-sitting and a lot of them are very capable to know the\n&gt; consequences of their decisions.  Reusing a protected method is dangerous --\n&gt; especially if this method has been documented with a lot of warnings -- but\n&gt; this doesn&#39;t mean it should be banned altogether.\n\nLibraries are by their nature patronizing. If the people designing a \nlibrary don&#39;t know more about the subject than the users of the library, \nthen why should anyone use it in the first place? We can&#39;t all be \nexperts in everything. We are all novices in some areas we need to work \nin. This is why we use libraries: so we can benefit from the wisdom of \npeople who know more in that particular field than we do. Some of that \nwisdom includes telling people what&#39;s dangerous and what isn&#39;t. It also \nincludes not exposing dangerous functionality by default without \ncarefully considering whether and how much it&#39;s needed.\n\nWhile some developers don&#39;t need baby-sitting, most do. In fact, let me \ndequalify that: All developers need to be baby sat. However we more \npolitely call it &quot;mentoring&quot;, &quot; code review&quot;, and &quot;pair programming&quot; \nrather than baby sitting. The agile truth is, babysitting works. Of \ncourse we end up babysitting each other at some point, which is fine. \nThe intelligence of the group often exceeds that of the sum of the \nindividual members.\n\nAgile programming is based on a humble attitude. Agility accepts that we \ndon&#39;t know everything, we can&#39;t predict the future, we don&#39;t get \nanything right the first time, and we will make mistakes. It endeavors \nto minimize the damage caused by these natural aspects of being human.\n\nThe dangerous arrogance is that of the programmer who believes he&#39;s god \nand can do no wrong; that he should be immediately allowed to do \nanything he wants to to do. (I use the masculine pronoun deliberately \nhere. I&#39;ve yet to meet a female programmer with this particular \npersonality defect, but it&#39;s epidemic among male programmers, and \nperhaps a little more common among younger ones who haven&#39;t yet had \nenough time to build a large personal catalog of really impressive \nfailures.)\n\n-- \n﻿Elliotte Rusty Harold  elharo@...\nXML in a Nutshell 3rd Edition Just Published!\nhttp://www.cafeconleche.org/books/xian3/\nhttp://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0596007647/cafeaulaitA/ref=nosim\n\n",
