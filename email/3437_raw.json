It&#39;s fine but may I ask: do you really need to test your \nclass with every possibilities?  I don&#39;t think so.  You cannot test \neverything (imagine if you want to test a drawing program with endless \npossibilities).\n\nWhat I would do (IMHO):\n\n- test the methods OK, NOK and ThrownError with the boundaries and 2/3 \nvalues (so you know that your class is doing what it should do)\n- if I really want to test all values of my class, a better way is to \nstress test it with (not 100% correct for your specifications, but just \nto give you an idea):\n\nfor (int i=-infinite; i&lt;-5; i++) {\n    try {\n       if (myClass.f(i) == false)\n          fail();\n    } catch (ExpectedException e) {\n       // fine or not fine, depends on i\n    } catch (Exception e) {\n       // not a normal exception\n       fail();\n    }\n}\n...\n\n(so you know that your method is not doing what it should not do)\n\nBecause it&#39;s really time consuming you should only do it:\n-overnight (unless you like to spend time in the cafeteria during the day)\n- only choose a panel of values to test.\n\nI haven&#39;t seen any stress testing extensions, maybe something to implement.\n\n\n-Vladimir\n\n\n-- \nVladimir Bossicard\nwww.bossicard.com\n\n\n",
