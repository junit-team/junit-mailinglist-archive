Perhaps a humble\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; library writer might look for ways to have that answer not always be\n&gt; &quot;=\r\nNo&quot;?\n&gt;\n&gt; If you&#39;re unsure of what to do when writing a library, it&#39;s better=\r\n to do\n&gt; nothing. When in doubt, leave it out. You can always put it in aga=\r\nin\n&gt; later,\n\n\nMaybe, but how many people will already have been discouraged=\r\n from using\nyour library just because you didn&#39;t give them enough hooks?\n\nT=\r\nhis has happened to me *many* times, both as a library author and as a\nlibr=\r\nary user.  And more often than not, I have sworn after the author of a\nlibr=\r\nary because they made a method private instead of protected (worst\noffender=\r\n:  MIDP1, where you don&#39;t even have the option of changing the\ncode).\n\n\nDo =\r\nas little as you can get away with. This principle makes both the library\n&gt;=\r\n developers&#39; and the users&#39;\n&gt; lives easier. Options are not free.\n\n\nWe&#39;ll j=\r\nust agree to disagree.  I, for one, am quite happy to see that JUnit4\nwill =\r\ncome with  a reasonable amount of protected methods &quot;for future\nexperimenta=\r\ntions&quot;.\n\n\nIt&#39;s not as if the library is fixed in stone and nothing can ever=\r\n be\n&gt; added to it.\n\n\nActually, most of the time, it is.  I mentioned MIDP1 =\r\nabove, but even if you\nare thinking of open-source libraries, modifying the=\r\n source means forking\nthe code most of the time, with all the maintenance n=\r\nightmare that ensue.\n\n\nIf someone thinks of something you hadn&#39;t thought of=\r\n, add\n&gt; it. But don&#39;t add just because you think someone  somewhere someday=\r\n\n&gt; might perhaps need it, even though you can&#39;t quite see how.\n\n\nYou seem t=\r\no be living in a world where every author of any imaginable\nlibrary is magi=\r\ncally available and willing to make the changes you need when\nyou ask for t=\r\nhem right away.\n\nMy experience is the complete opposite of that.\n\n--\nC=E9dr=\r\nic\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n",
