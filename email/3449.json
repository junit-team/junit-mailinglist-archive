    "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-509598038\">When a jar loads from the jre/lib/ext directory, it gets a different<br/>\nclassloader and default security profile then something which loads from<br/>\nyour classpath. This profile prevents it from loading classes from<br/>\narbitrary locations. This behavior was a design choice on Sun&#39;s part- the<br/>\nextension loader is intended to support the requirements of your run of<br/>\nthe mill executable jars, not the unusual needs of junit.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe swingui and awtui work fine because they create their own classloader<br/>\nand it is the same whether or not they are loaded via jre/lib/ext. The<br/>\ncustom classloader, however, has a number of known bugs in it which cause<br/>\npeople problems from time to time. Some folks use the textui specifically<br/>\nto avoid these problems.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s probably a better idea to put junit in your classpath. If you are<br/>\ncompiling on several different systems which require different classpaths,<br/>\nI can give you some hints on how to do this cleanly with ANT.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Wed, 5 Dec 2001, Daniel Le Berre wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Hi guys,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; When I put the junit.jar in the jre/lib/ext directory to get<br/>\n&gt; junit without changing all the users classpath, the<br/>\n&gt; junit.textui.TestRunner does not find my classes.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; However, both swingui and awtui TestRunners are working fine.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; If I put the junit.jar in my classpath, everything works fine.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I do believe than the problem comes from the use of the default<br/>\n&gt; class loader in testui.TestRunner: when I use the extension<br/>\n&gt; mechanism, only the core classes and the ones in the extension<br/>\n&gt; directory can be found by the default class loader.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Would it be possible to use the custom class loader also for textui<br/>\n&gt; to solve the problem?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; \tDaniel<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nEric Vought<br/>\nChief Technical Officer - QLUE Consulting, Inc.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:evought@...\">evought@...</a> toll-free: 888-771-3538  RTP area: 919-816-9901 </span></blockquote></div>",
