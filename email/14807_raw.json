By \n=\r\n&gt; using Javassist together with JUnit I managed to add a powerful yet \n&gt; si=\r\nmple way of doing declarative (from the test-class) mocking of \n&gt; troubleso=\r\nme classes in the class tree you are about to test. \n&gt; \n&gt; Read about it her=\r\ne: \n&gt; http://tobyonrails.blogspot.com/2005/09/junitassist-unfolds-catch-\n&gt; =\r\n22.html\n&gt; \n\nYou cheated by modifying JUnit ;-) Does it work with the eclips=\r\ne runner?\n\nI was working on something similar, extending JUnit. The big pro=\r\nblem is how to insert the custom classloader early enough in each test run.=\r\n\n\nI had created a test decorator to do this that works with 3.8.1 but now I=\r\n would like to target junit4. I am not sure how to continue as the whole de=\r\ncorator concept will die. With the new architecture there seems to be very =\r\nlittle oportunity to extend junit with anything that is not built in.\n\n- Ne=\r\nil\n\n",
