Private methods\ngenerally mean that I have several abstraction layers living within\nthe same class.  I&#39;m not bothered by this in principle, until I find\nthe &quot;hidden&quot; abstraction layer troublesome or interesting enough that\nI&#39;m tempted to test it directly, in which case I take the time to\nthink about the name and interface of that hidden abstraction layer,\nand expose it as a class.\n\n   David Saff\n\nOn 2/12/07, Ole Ersoy &lt;ole_ersoy@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Hi Guys,\n&gt;\n&gt; Would it be a good idea to always use all public\n&gt; methods...?\n&gt;\n&gt; In the context of a convention where there is a\n&gt; &quot;MainClass&quot; and a &quot;MainClassHelper&quot; that has public\n&gt; methods used to help the MainClass.\n&gt;\n&gt; Users of MainClassHelper (The collaborator should\n&gt; really be MainClass only) know that this class exists\n&gt; mainly for the purpose of helping MainClass, and all\n&gt; the methods are public, so that they can be easily\n&gt; unit tested.\n&gt;\n&gt; Otherwise they would be private or protected members\n&gt; of MainClass.\n&gt;\n&gt; So MainClassHelper can really be thought of as a\n&gt; utility library that is specific to MainClass...\n&gt;\n&gt; Anyone know if there are security risks to this,\n&gt; beside API risks?\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt; - Ole\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ____________________________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Don&#39;t get soaked.
