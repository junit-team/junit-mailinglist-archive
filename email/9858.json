If your public methods are already covered with tests, you have to<br/>\nstop and ask yourself why the private method needs testing at all..<br/>\nisn&#39;t the testing through the public interface sufficient.  If you<br/>\nfeel that you do need to do more testing, refactor to remove the<br/>\nprivate method.  The nicest way to do this is to create a new class<br/>\nand move the method over to it as a public method.  You can use the<br/>\ntests that you have to verify that you did the move correctly.<br/>\n<br/>\n2. If your public methods aren&#39;t covered with tests and you need to<br/>\ntest a private method, make it package-scope.  This may feel weird,<br/>\nbut it gives you coverage and allows you to move towards a clearer<br/>\nsolution later.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMichael Feathers<br/>\nwww.objectmentor.com</div>",
