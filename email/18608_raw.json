I noticed there are a gazillion raw jar\nfiles in my installation plugins directory.\n\nIf you unzip the contents of the eclipse folder into\nyour &quot;eclipse&quot; installation folder, everything should\ninstall, as long as you have a compatible version.\n\nBut also,\n\nThere should be an automatic install for EMF via the\nupdate site.\n\n\nHelp &gt; Software Updates &gt; Find and Install\n\nSelect \n\nSearch for new features to install\n\n\n\nIt should find EMF for you.\n\nYou probably want to flag the part about removing\noverlapping plugins.\n\nI think that the updater pulls overlapping installs\nfrom all the update sites, so that just removes the\noverlaps.\n\nOnce you have it installed, the Tutorial gives you all\nthe steps to add a JET nature to your project, and\nfrom there you can play with JET.\n\nAlso, the library EMF tutorial should give you\neverything you need.  You download a version of the\nlibrary model (XML Schema, Ecore, Rose) and generate\nan EMF Model from it.  Now you have a model that you\ncan pass to JET templates and play with.\n\nLet me know how it works out.\n\nGood luck and Happy New Year,\n- Ole\n\n\n--- junitheadache &lt;bohs01@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;ve dled the bundle from EMF website however I&#39;ve\n&gt; no idea how to \n&gt; install it? I&#39;ve unzipped it and its just a bunch of\n&gt; jar files?\n&gt; \n&gt; I am new to eclipse should I copy all of those files\n&gt; into the \n&gt; respective eclipse directory or something?\n&gt; \n&gt; Help needed,\n&gt; Jimm\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In junit@yahoogroups.com, Ole Ersoy\n&gt; &lt;ole_ersoy@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; You may also want to check out the Eclipse\n&gt; Modeling\n&gt; &gt; Framework (EMF), as it generates stub tests for\n&gt; all of\n&gt; &gt; it&#39;s model classes using JET templates.  This may\n&gt; &gt; server as a good baseline to generate tests on top\n&gt; of.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Also Ecore (The EMF Meta Modeling Framework) is\n&gt; useful\n&gt; &gt; for thinking about the Semantics of Java and\n&gt; object\n&gt; &gt; oriented structure.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; For example an EAttribrute is used to model\n&gt; primitives\n&gt; &gt; in Java, as well as Strings.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; So if you start with models of what Java lets you\n&gt; do,\n&gt; &gt; you can use those models to Enumerate all\n&gt; &gt; possibilities and generate tests that test the\n&gt; &gt; expectations around what is to be returned by\n&gt; method\n&gt; &gt; calls and recommend various model invarient\n&gt; &gt; constraints that would give feedback on illegal\n&gt; values\n&gt; &gt; that would produce unwanted results.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Alternatively if you use Java&#39;s Reflection\n&gt; &gt; capabilities  that should get you a long ways as\n&gt; well.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- Kevin Lawrence &lt;kev.lawrence@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; On 12/27/06, junitheadache\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;bohs01@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hi all,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I am currently working on auto generation of\n&gt; test\n&gt; &gt; &gt; cases for TDD for\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; my honors year project. And was considering\n&gt; &gt; &gt; modifying JUnit such\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that it will auto generate some test cases\n&gt; based\n&gt; &gt; &gt; values flagged by\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; users.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; E.g.,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Public boolean isLegalInt(int x){\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; /* input - 0 &lt; x &lt; 10, result - True*/\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; }\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; given a comment like the above will generate\n&gt; &gt; &gt; assert statements such\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; as\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; assertFalse(isLegalInt(0));\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; assertTrue(isLegalInt(1));\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; assertTrue(isLegalInt(9));\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; assertFalse(isLegalInt(10));\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Hi Junitheadache,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; You should read David Saff&#39;s recent post on this\n&gt; &gt; &gt; list about &quot;The\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Practice of Theories&quot;.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; David proposes an extension to JUnit that would\n&gt; &gt; &gt; allow programmers to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; create DbC-like tests that would apply to *all*\n&gt; &gt; &gt; parameters to a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; method, for example:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; @Theory public void\n&gt; multiplyIsInverseOfDivide(Money\n&gt; &gt; &gt; amount, int multiplier) {\n&gt; &gt; &gt; assertEquals(amount,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; amount.times(multiplier).divideBy(multiplier));\n&gt; &gt; &gt; }\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; A specialized test-runner would then behave as a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; kind of &quot;theorem\n&gt; &gt; &gt; disprover&quot; and look for counter-examples that\n&gt; cause\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the assertion to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; fail. There is way more to it than this simple\n&gt; &gt; &gt; example - read the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; paper at\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\nhttp://shareandenjoy.saff.net/2006/12/new-paper-practice-of-\n&gt; theories.html\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Note that this is not exactly TDD - it is more\n&gt; of a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; specification and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; testing tool than a design tool - but it could\n&gt; be a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; very nice\n&gt; &gt; &gt; complement to TDD to document /general rules/\n&gt; rather\n&gt; &gt; &gt; than /specific\n&gt; &gt; &gt; examples/ .\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; See also my blog about &quot;For all vs There Exists&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; thinking at\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\nhttp://www.developertesting.com/archives/month200604/20060413-\n&gt; ForAllVsThereExists.html\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Note that David&#39;s approach does not actually\n&gt; &gt; &gt; generate code in the way\n&gt; &gt; &gt; that you are suggesting. But it could, for\n&gt; example,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; generate specific\n&gt; &gt; &gt; tests to illustrate the cases where the theory\n&gt; does\n&gt; &gt; &gt; not hold.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Kevin\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; www.junitfactory.com\n&gt; &gt; &gt; You send us code.
