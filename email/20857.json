In one case I found that a class<br/>\nthat had one method mocked was using the real method in 4.4 (which<br/>\nseems wrong) and was using the mocked method in 4.5 (which seems right).<br/>\n<br/>\nThat is, it seems as if a bug was fixed from 4.4 to 4.5.<br/>\n<br/>\nI fixed that one test of ours and now I am looking at a few others for<br/>\nsimilar situations.  I am mostly just curious.  Thanks.<br/>\n<br/>\n--- Patrick</div>",
