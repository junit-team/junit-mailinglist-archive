I haven&#39;t exactly thought this through in\ndetail, but I think my requirements come down to being able to store\narbitrary information in a Description, a key.\n\nI&#39;m interesting in testing with Scala, and there are (at least) two generic\nproblems:\n\n1) Tests which are not linked to a specific method, but are run as separate\ntests. Scalatest for example allows the following\n\n@RunWith(classOf[JUnitRunner])\nclass FileSpec extends FlatSpec with ShouldMatchers {\n\n  &quot;A Stack&quot; should &quot;pop values in last-in-first-out order&quot; in {\n  }\n\n  it should &quot;throw NoSuchElementException if an empty stack is popped&quot; in {\n  }\n}\n\nThis creates a single method with the two tests within. However, the\nJUnitRunner runs the single method but records the two tests separately.\nThis can be seen in Eclipse, see attached scalatest1.png. Now if I double\nclick on the test name in the junit view, it tries to find a method of that\nname, and fails. Obviously, to correct this would require a fix to Eclipse,\nbut if I could store the file & line number instead of the method name, I\ncould jump to the appropriate line.\n\n2) Scala allows spaces and other characters in method names, but these\nnames are munged on compilation. For instance, space gets translated to\n$0020.\n\nclass FileTest extends AssertionsForJUnit {\n@Test def `foo bar`() = {\n\n}\n}\n\nHere the jump to in Eclipse works correctly, but the displayed description\nin Eclipse isn&#39;t nice, see scalatest2.png.\n\nSo in both cases, the string I would like to display (in Eclipse, surefire\nwhatever) doesn&#39;t match the method name, either because there is no method\nname or because It&#39;s not the same thing. I think that I could work around\nmost issues is Eclipse etc if the test runner could add some arbitrary\ninformation to the description, which it could subsequently use. A string\nwould be fine, because I could define the contents of that String, but\narbitrary data would be even better. String would be simpler for everyone I\nthink.\n\nPlease note that I&#39;m just thinking aloud at the minute, and I haven&#39;t\nactually done any proof of concepts as yet, but if you have any ideas,\nplease feel free to take this to email.\n\nMatthew Farwell.\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n",
