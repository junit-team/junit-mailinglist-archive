Overall it&#39;s been a pretty rewarding experience.  I\noften find myself scurrying to the bookstore (or google) to read up on\nvarious topics that come up.  Today I finally ran into something I\ncouldn&#39;t solve cleanly: how does one write tests for code that spawns\nthreads, where the threads can throw exceptions?  I&#39;m specifically\nlooking at the JMF library.  In many cases the caller of the code\ndoesn&#39;t have any direct access to the threads that are spawned. \nUnless I&#39;ve missed something it looks as if JUnit does not deal with\nthis situation.  What&#39;s a good strategy for dealing with this? \nThreadGroup might help some, but only in cases where I can get access\nto the spawned threads.  \n\nAny insights appreciated.\n\n\n\n",
