Based on that experience an &quot;unrooted test&quot; is a tes=\r\nt that is\nrun without having been declared previously by the runner (in my =\r\ncase\nI had to fix my runner implementation that was, no doubt, not behaving=\r\n\nacording to spec). It would probably not hurt to ask this question in\nan E=\r\nclipse forum aswell, it seems that exlipse single-test runner is\ndoing some=\r\nthing that is not quite correct.\n\n/J\n\n\n\nOn Jan 2, 2008 4:56 PM, yubi &lt;ayub.=\r\nmalik@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;  Bradley, Todd wrote:\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; I=\r\n&#39;m using Eclipse 3.3 with JUnit 4.4.
