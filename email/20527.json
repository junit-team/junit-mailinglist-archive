However,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the outcome surprise me. Assertion success but<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; obj1.equals(obj2) return false.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; What&#39;s going on inside assertEquals() operation? Is this<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; what it&#39;s suppose to be?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; As I stated, albeit not very clearly the first time (Curse you<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Rich Text Editor(Beta)&quot;!), I suspect that the culprit here is<br/>\n&gt; &gt; that &quot;Assert.assertEquals(Object, Object)&quot; is not being called<br/>\n&gt; &gt; at all. This is borne out by the fact that a J2SE 1.4 compiler<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and a JavaSE 1.5 compiler treat the same call completely<br/>\n&gt; &gt; differently.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I *SUSPECT* that the 1.5 compiler is unboxing the Double<br/>\n&gt; &gt; objects into primitive longs and that the method that is<br/>\n&gt; &gt; *ACTUALLY* called is &quot;Assert.assertEquals(long,long)&quot;. This<br/>\n&gt; &gt; accounts for the behavior since the integer parts of your two<br/>\n&gt; &gt; numbers are the same. &quot;Assert.assertEquals(long,long)&quot; yields<br/>\n&gt; &gt; successful after the Doubles are converted (truncated) to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; longs.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; That&#39;s almost certainly what is happening, and good deduction.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Thank you very much!<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Now we ask the question, what&#39;s the better answer? Defeat the  <br/>\n&gt; purpose of assertEquals(Object,Object) or letting programmers  <br/>\n&gt; hoist themselves on their own petards?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; JUnit could detect this situation, but if it did, I&#39;d prefer  <br/>\n&gt; it to warn the programmer rather than fix the problem, because  <br/>\n&gt; I want to encourage programmers to improve their design:  <br/>\n&gt; either the test should compare the Double values with a  <br/>\n&gt; tolerance, or perhaps the production code ought not to use<br/>\n&gt; Doubles.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Well if that is the best solution (and I must say that I like it<br/>\nbetter than the status quo) then the easiest way to do that would<br/>\nprobably be to create a bogus &quot;Assert.assertEquals(double,double)&quot; that:<br/>\n<br/>\nA) is deprecated (Yes, I mean it. A new method that is deprecated and<br/>\nwith no intent ever to remove it). The javadoc should point to the<br/>\n3-double overload as the preferred alternative and explain why.<br/>\n<br/>\n*AND*<br/>\n<br/>\nB) is implemented to unconditionally throw<br/>\n&quot;UnsupportedOperationException&quot; (or similar unchecked standard<br/>\nexception) with a message that indicates that you should use the<br/>\n3-double overload instead.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- Roger Glover<br/>\n   Object Partners, Inc.</div>",
