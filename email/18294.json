Perhaps using FIT or some other acceptance-testing framework.<br/>\n&gt; Those<br/>\n&gt; tests are typically run more seldomly than your unit-tests.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; This is just my opinion on a way forward.

The easiest way is probably<br/>\nto package your tests in their own application (or bundle them with the<br/>\napplication you are trying to test) and run them as a regular Java EE<br/>\napplication.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nCédric<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",
