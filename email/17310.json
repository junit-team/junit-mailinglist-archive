Check in.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; If you postpone your testing a bit, you have:  Code v1, Code v2, Code<br/>\n&gt; v3,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Test v3, Commit.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; The latter approach will get you to your goal much faster.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I think we disagree here, but before I say more, I&#39;d like to know how<br/>\n&gt; much.  I hear that &quot;It _can be argued_ that writing test firsts can be<br/>\n&gt; detrimental to your velocity&quot;, and then &quot;TDD _can be_ a big waste of<br/>\n&gt; time&quot;, and then &quot;The latter approach _will_ get you to your goal much<br/>\n&gt; faster&quot;.  Which of these is your personal experience?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSorry to dodge your question, but I really don&#39;t think my experience has<br/>\nmuch relevance in what I wrote above.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust reread what I wrote above and you&#39;ll see six tasks in the first case<br/>\nand four tasks in the second one.  Isn&#39;t it obvious that quite often, the<br/>\nformer approach will take longer than the latter?<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nCédric<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed] </span></blockquote></div>",
