If your class implements three<br/>\ninterfaces, then you have three test cases for that class, each a<br/>\nsubclass of the corresponding abstract test for each interface. Run them<br/>\nall. No law says you must have one test case per production class, and<br/>\nin fact, you probably shouldn&#39;t!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s a simple matter of keeping the test tree as understandable as the<br/>\nsource it is testing. If there are too many test classes testing a<br/>\nsingle source class, it become difficult to look at a package for the<br/>\nfirst time and understand what is going on. The link that Paolo sent on<br/>\nan earlier post has a link showing the use of inner classes to organize<br/>\nthe abstract test cases. The benefit is that I can enter a package, look<br/>\nfor a single class WidgetTest.java and be able to track back all of the<br/>\ntests associated with Widget.java.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Also, only some objects implement the equals method. These<br/>\n&gt;I have a standard set of tests to ensure that null and a few other<br/>\n&gt;scenarios are handled correctly (as well as the hashcode / equals<br/>\n&gt;relationship). I would like to have these standard tests available for<br/>\n&gt;different objects without having to rewrite them all the time.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>GSBase&#39;s EqualsTester for testing equals(). JUnit-addons also has<br/>\nsomething, but I can&#39;t remember the name of it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks, I&#39;ll check it out.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nJ. B.
