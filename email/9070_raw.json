There is one large differenc=\r\ne in estimating models between programming with tests and programming witho=\r\nut tests. When programming with tests it is generally faster to get to work=\r\ning code because the tests enable that, eliminating post-code debugging and=\r\n fixing.\n\nIf you are adding tests to existing code, then be aware that writ=\r\ning those tests will probably take longer than you expect, because the exis=\r\nting code is probably not designed to be easily tested. Moreover, the tests=\r\n will uncover refactoring opportunity that will point to time wasted during=\r\n initial development due to unnecessary duplication.\n\nIf you go to your man=\r\nager with effort estimates to add programmer tests to a project that does n=\r\not have them, I wish you the best of luck. You may be shot.\n\nTake care.\n\n\n&gt;=\r\nSo said Selvakumar Ganesan on 2003-08-08 --------------------\n&gt;Hi,\n&gt;I am tr=\r\nying to estimate effort for writing a regression test suite based\n&gt;on Junit=\r\n for an existing system. \n&gt;The method used for estimation is very simple (a=\r\nnd possibly very wrong\n&gt;too) as described below. I greatly appreciate all i=\r\nnputs and thoughts on\n&gt;this. I googled and found no past or present precede=\r\nnt to estimating\n&gt;Junit test efforts based on Code complexity measures. I m=\r\nay have missed\n&gt;something important due to my ignorance and relative newnes=\r\ns to Junit\n&gt;and estimation. I shall gladly stand corrected by more knowledg=\r\neable\n&gt;folks.\n&gt;\n&gt;---------------------------------------------\n&gt;*Hypotheses=\r\n\n&gt;The working hypothesis for the effort estimation was &quot;a strong\n&gt;corelatio=\r\nn between cyclomatic complexity of existing code and the effort\n&gt;to write j=\r\nunit tests for the code&quot;.\n&gt;\n&gt;As a consequence of this hypothesis it is furt=\r\nher purported that &quot;the\n&gt;number of independent execution paths (Cyclomatic =\r\ncomplexity) is equal\n&gt;to the number of test methods&quot;. This dictates some na=\r\nsty terms to how\n&gt;the junit tests must be structured but it is believed to =\r\nbe a *resonable\n&gt;thing* for estimation purposes.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;*The estimation metho=\r\nd\n&gt;Weighted Methods Per Class (WMPC) was used as a measure of complexity.\n&gt;=\r\nWMPC is defined to be &quot;the sum of the complexity of all methods for a\n&gt;clas=\r\ns, where each method is weighted by its cyclomatic complexity. The\n&gt;number =\r\nof methods and the complexity of the methods involved is a\n&gt;predictor of ho=\r\nw much time and effort is required to develop and\n&gt;maintain the class. Only=\r\n methods specified in a class are included, that\n&gt;is, any methods inherited=\r\n from a parent are excluded.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;The WMPC measured from the existing codeba=\r\nse was normalized for trivial\n&gt;methods like getter and setters. \n&gt;\n&gt;The eff=\r\nort was estimated using a simple formula:\n&gt;Total Effort =3D Total number of=\r\n test methods * Average effort for one\n&gt;test method\n&gt;\n&gt;The Total number of =\r\ntest methods is calculated as follows:-\n&gt;Total test methods =3D Average WMP=\r\nC of all classes * Number of classes\n&gt;\n&gt;The Average effort for one test met=\r\nhod (note that this is test method\n&gt;and not test case class) was estimated =\r\nfrom actual efforts.\n&gt;\n&gt;*Sample calculation\n&gt;Number of Classes =3D 973\n&gt;Ave=\r\nrage WMPC ~=3D 9 (normalized for getter and setter methods. I used\n&gt;Togethe=\r\nr ControlCenter-&gt;Metrics for all these measures)\n&gt;Average effort per test m=\r\nethod =3D 2 hours (It is upto the developer to\n&gt;distribute the test methods=\r\n in a test case classes)\n&gt;\n&gt;Total effort for writing Junit tests =3D (9 * 9=\r\n73) * 2 hrs =3D 17, 514 hours\n&gt;=3D 2189 Person Days. \n&gt;(*huh..hmm*. Let the=\r\n beatings begin. I can&#39;t adequaltely express in\n&gt;words my manager&#39;s bewilde=\r\nred expression on seeing this number. But,\n&gt;that&#39;s another story.)\n&gt;-------=\r\n--------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt;If the general direction of the e=\r\nstimation is correct I would want to\n&gt;spend some time on refining the metho=\r\nd to include all those important\n&gt;factors I am sure I have missed out above=\r\n. Suggestions and pointers\n&gt;towards places I should look more closely to ge=\r\nt a better grip is more\n&gt;than welcome.
