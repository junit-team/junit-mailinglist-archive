I just needed that extra leverage which can \nmake =\r\nthe test to generate log files that are user friendly and a \nperson can und=\r\nerstand whats going on in the tests without going \nthrough the source code.=\r\n I happened to get help from one of the \nguys &quot;Ilja Preu=DF&#39;s&quot; and he has p=\r\nosted me a link regd. logging in \ninformation.

Till now, =\r\nall the assert\n&gt; &gt; statements throws message only if the statement fails. I=\r\n want to \nknow\n&gt; &gt; is there a way to dump a message even if the assert stat=\r\nement \npasses??\n&gt; \n&gt; You could just print to the console, or adding logging=\r\n to your test \ncases.\n&gt; \n&gt; One of the design philosophies behind JUnit is t=\r\nhat, if all the \ntests \n&gt; pass, we only care about seeing an &quot;OK&quot; or a gree=\r\nn bar. We only \nwant \n&gt; information if tests fail. That is why, &quot;out of the=\r\n box&quot;, JUnit \ndoes not \n&gt; provide information about passing tests.\n&gt; \n&gt; Tak=\r\ne care.\n&gt; -- \n&gt; J. B.
