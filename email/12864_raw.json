The application\ni=\r\ns quite complex and uses Javascript extensively.\nMy purpose is to create a =\r\ntest that mimics the steps in a `Change\nRequest&#39; or `Defect&#39; . This would b=\r\ne created by the\ndeveloper and\nexecuted before and after the bugfix/change.=\r\n Therefore I needed a java\nbased framework with which to create the test ca=\r\nses.\n\nSince these test case need to test a web application, I researched an=\r\nd\nfinally focused on following three options. Note that while there are\nbun=\r\nch of tools/frameworks, I did not find any big winners.\n\nJAKARTA CACTUS =96=\r\n While I have successfully created some tests with\nJakarta Cactus Framework=\r\n to create server side tests that have access\nto HttpSession etc. objects.,=\r\n this does not allow us to mimic a\nuser&#39;s\nbrowser experience.\n\nHTTPUNIT/JWE=\r\nBUNIT =96 After spending considerable time with this\nframework, I feel it h=\r\nas ways to go before it can be used for complex\nWeb application testing. On=\r\ne of the primary issue is limited support\nfor Javascript. Even if I was to =\r\nbypass that, I found that the time\ntaken to create an automated test is too=\r\n long.\n\nTESTMAKER =96 This is created and recommend by Frank Cohen in his\nb=\r\nook\nJava Testing and Design. My reservations with this tool is that I did\nn=\r\not get the impression that is was used by enough developers/testers.\n\nMy qu=\r\nestion is :\n\n1. Has anyone implemented automated testing harness for their\n=\r\nenterprise web application that has brought significant value to QA of\nthei=\r\nr software product/system?\n\n2. If so, then what was the tool/framework used=\r\n ? And would you say\ncritical success factor is\na) your architecture/method=\r\nology of automated testing harness or\nb) the tool/framework\n\n3. Is this eve=\r\nn feasible exercise? Can automated testing harness be\ncreated to enterprise=\r\n web applications?\n\nThank you\n\n- Niraj\nSurya Infosys Corp\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
