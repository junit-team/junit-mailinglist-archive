I use a mix of Maven 1, Ant and shell scripts for builds, and  <br/>\n&gt; some people here prefer to write code in IntelliJ or even vim. My  <br/>\n&gt; suggestion would be an external file, crap4j.config perhaps, in the  <br/>\n&gt; classpath somewhere, and have it contain entries like:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Ignore:<br/>\n&gt; com.pjacobsson.crap.*<br/>\n&gt; com.pjacobsson.SomeClass<br/>\n&gt; com.pjacobsson.SomeOtherClass.crappyMethod<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; An @Ignore annotation on class or method level could be a nice  <br/>\n&gt; addition for some cases, but it should be optional. I&#39;d prefer to  <br/>\n&gt; not have dependencies from the code to tools like crap4j, at least  <br/>\n&gt; not in an early stage.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Also, it could be useful to be able to set an &quot;acceptable CRAP  <br/>\n&gt; score&quot; on method level, and if it goes above that the method should  <br/>\n&gt; show up in the reports.
