So=\r\n I have a chicken egg sort of situation. NB would do the obvious thing, i.e=\r\n., have tests generated from code, so the above doesn&#39;t make any sense as i=\r\nt implies that the code is generated from the test, which is a cool idea of=\r\n the IDE could support it.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; I have experience using JUnit, so the frame=\r\nwork itself isn&#39;t in question, but how to apply this methodology within the=\r\n IDE format is.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Do I have to simply short-circuit the default process =\r\nthat NB and the JUnit plugin manufacture?\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; thanks in advance for a=\r\nny help on this,\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Karl\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; ----------------------------=\r\n--------\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Yahoo!
