(I&#39;m sure someone has.)   What I\n&gt; what to do is generate a report that shows some stats on how many classes\n&gt; have test cases and how many methods in the class under test have\n&gt; corresponding test methods.  I have tried it a few different ways:\n&gt;\n&gt; 1. Just scanning through the source folder, picking up the java files and\n&gt; then checking if a ?Test.java file exists in a corresponding unit test\n&gt; folder.\n&gt;\n&gt; This approach works well if I only cared about the file coverage, but I now\n&gt; want info on the method coverage.  Enter method 2.\n&gt;\n&gt; 2. Use a tool that will parse through the java source and tell me all the\n&gt; methods. I used javadoc for this, but the problem with it is that I can only\n&gt; sort through one source structure at a time, and javadoc is not so nice to\n&gt; call programmatically (it shuts down your app after it runs once).\n&gt;\n&gt; If anyone has suggestions on a better was to get info on the methods in a\n&gt; class, and other information like is the class an interface, I would love to\n&gt; hear it.  Or better yet, if anyone has seen or built a tool similar to what\n&gt; I&#39;m doing I would also love to hear about it.\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt;\n&gt; John\n&gt;\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
