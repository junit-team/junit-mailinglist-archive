Performance tests don&#39;t run as often as object tests, <br/>\nbecause the former are slower and can get in the way of the latter. When <br/>\nthis happens, I split the source tree in two, putting the performance <br/>\ntests in their own source tree, apart from the object tests. I&#39;ve done <br/>\nthis so often that I end up with this default structure for Java projects:<br/>\n<br/>\nproduction/<br/>\n     source/<br/>\n     classes/<br/>\ntest/<br/>\n     source/<br/>\n     classes/<br/>\nendtoend/<br/>\n     source/<br/>\n     classes/<br/>\nfixture/<br/>\n     source/<br/>\n     classes/<br/>\nperformance/<br/>\n     source/<br/>\n     classes/<br/>\n...and so on. Each source tree gets it own source and classes directories.<br/>\n<br/>\nSeparate source trees have many benefits:<br/>\n  * Eclipse can run all the tests in one source tree easily<br/>\n  * Different items are built to different locations, making it easier <br/>\nto avoid production code depending on test code<br/>\n  * Easy to ship the production code without the tests, since that&#39;s <br/>\nstill the norm<br/>\n<br/>\nI used to use separate projects, but that creates annoying class path <br/>\nproblems, so I settled on separate source trees. My Ant tasks mirror <br/>\nwhat Eclipse does, building separate source trees to separate build <br/>\nlocations.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe bottom line: if the tests are really /that/ different, then we <br/>\nshould emphasize the difference by placing the tests in different <br/>\nlocations, rather that merely annotating them.<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJ.
