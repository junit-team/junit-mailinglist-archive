That&#39;s good to know.  I&#39;ll give it a try.  I don&#39;t know much about the shell, but \nI was able to put a bunch of aliases in the profile which is good enough for now.  I&#39;m \njust using a text editor and the shell to compile for now.  I&#39;m in my third java course \nso things still aren&#39;t that hectic as far as managing files / projects.  I&#39;ve heard the IDE \nthat comes with the Mac osx version of java is really good so I&#39;ll probably give that a \ntry one of these days.  Thanks again.\n\n-Lido\n\n--- In junit@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Chappell, Simon P&quot; &lt;simon.chappell@l...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Welcome to the world of CLASSPATH ... One of the less elegant aspects of Java \ndevelopment.\n&gt; \n&gt; The issue that you are dealing with here is that there are two kinds of references \nthat you can have in a CLASSPATH. The first is a JAR file and the second is a directory. \nUnfortunately, a JAR file in a directory on the CLASSPATH does not get searched (I \nknow, I know, it&#39;s silly, but we have to live with it). So to address your question, you \nwill need to include both the reference to the Junit JAR file and the directory where the \nsamples live. eg:\n&gt; \n&gt; CLASSPATH=$CLASSPATH:/Applications/Utilities/Java/junit3.8.1/junit.jar:/\nApplications/Utilities/Java/junit3.8.1\n&gt; export CLASSPATH\n&gt; \n&gt; This will get you to the next step, but it does sound like you need to learn a little \nmore about the shell, (http://www.tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/ is a good programming \nguide to the bash shell).\n&gt; \n&gt; Also, I strongly suggest switching to ant (http://ant.apache.org/) for your compile/\nbuild process. It isn&#39;t perfect, but it does 99% of most everything that I need, and I \ncode in Java for a living. It will also help with CLASSPATH issues.\n&gt; \n&gt; Consider switching to a CLASSPATH of &quot;.&quot;, yes that is just the current directory and \nthen using the &lt;path&gt; facilities for individual projects.\n&gt; \n&gt; Anyway, this might have been more than you wanted, but I hope that something in \nthe above helps.\n&gt; \n&gt; Feel free to contact me directly if you want more help, or we can continue to work \nthrough the mailing list so that others can be helped. :-)\n&gt; \n&gt; Simon\n&gt; \n&gt; -----------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; Simon P.
