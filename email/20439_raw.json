I can choose to have my list of parameters as either t=\r\nwo values\n&gt; or a single, which would assume the usage of a default value). =\r\n How\n&gt; would I go about doing that?  (Would I need to use a different runne=\r\nr?)\n&gt; \n&gt; How would I generalize this to any number of parameters (required =\r\nand\n&gt; optional)?\nAs I stated in my previous answer in Java the only way to =\r\nsupply\ndefault parameters to function (and to constructor as I explained) i=\r\ns\nto overload it when one constructor call another. But what you could\ndo i=\r\ns to move this calculation of default values from the only\nconstructor to @=\r\nParametrized static method. Because you can&#39;t declare\nmore than one constru=\r\nctor you should define helper class for this purpose.\nFor example, you want=\r\n to use 2 parameters one is boolean with default\nvalue false and second is =\r\nrequired.\n\n@RunWith(Parameterized.class)\npublic class YourTest {\n    @Param=\r\neters\n    public static Collection&lt;?&gt; testFindLastOrder(){\n\t\treturn Arrays.=\r\n&lt;Object[]&gt;asList(new Object[][]{\n                        YourTestHelper hel=\r\nper =3D new YourTestHelper(); \n\t\t\t{helper.getDefaultFlagValue(), OrderType.=\r\nSIGN_UP, 1}, // 0\n\t\t\t{helper.getDefaultFlagValue(), OrderType.SIGN_UP, 15},=\r\n // 1\n                        {true, -7}, // 1\n\t\t\t\n\t};\n    private boolean =\r\nflag;\n    private int i;    \n\n    public YourTest(boolean flag, int i){\n   =\r\n    this.flag =3D flag;\n       this.i =3D i;\n    }\n    ...\n}\n\npublic class =\r\nYourTestHelper {\n   public boolean getDefaultFlagValue(){\n       return fal=\r\nse;\n   }\n}\n \nYou can optimize this code, but the idea is clear. If you subc=\r\nlass\nYourTest class and want to change parameters that are passed to the\nte=\r\nst class, you should simply define @Parameters method in your\nsubclass. You=\r\n will use, perhaps, different helper class, which in is\ncase, perhaps subcl=\r\nasses YourTestHelper.  \n\n \n&gt; Finally, what if I wanted my parameterized tes=\r\nts to be named via some\n&gt; naming function (instead of serially numbered lik=\r\ne Parameterized)?\n&gt;\nYou can consider to use Theories instead of Parameteriz=\r\ned. Their you\nhave support for this. Note, that Theories run all permutatio=\r\nns of\nyour parametrizes, so it can be not exactly what you want. I have no\n=\r\nexperience by using this though, so I can&#39;t help you more.  \n\n\n",
