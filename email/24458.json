From my point of view this is the way to go for a greenfield project.<br><br>However, while working with legacy code this is not always possible. The described tool is a simple helper class to create a good test coverage for existing codebases before changing something, so basically it is a TDD helper. Nothing more. Of course it is up to the designer to check what is tested and create a good test strategy. For our current project, this simple helper saved us a lot of time, so i want to share it with the community.<br><br>Regards<br>Mirko</div>",
