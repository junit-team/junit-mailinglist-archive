That&#39;s true.\nBut I made a test using a command line and the trouble was exactly the same:\nneed ^C to stop the TestCase.\nIt seems then not a problem due to IDE integration.\n\nA comment I can add is that this trouble has been appeared with the Junit\n3.7 version.\nWe used the 3.2 version before and we didn&#39;t have this problem.\nI had a look in the code and the only reference with Thread I found in the\n3.7 version (which was not in the 3.2) is the TestResult.runProtected method\nwhich catch a ThreadDeath exception.\n\n \tcatch (ThreadDeath e) { // don&#39;t catch ThreadDeath by accident\n\t\tthrow e;\n\t}\n\nBut I am not sure to understand what this catch is stand for?\nSo I can not know if it is directly bounded to my problem.\n\nAny feedback?\n\n-sylv1\n\n-----Original Message-----\n\n\nAre you running from an IDE integration?  If so, it is more likely an\nintegration problem.  Check with the IDE folks (Instantiations?).\n\n-jason\n\n&gt; Hi everybody,\n&gt;\n&gt; I have troubles with TestCases run.\n&gt; My configuration: junit 3.7, junit.textui.TestRunner\n&gt;                   jdk 1.3.1 Windows NT version (nobody&#39;s perfect ;-),\n&gt;                   codeguide IDE.\n&gt;\n&gt; When some TestCases are executed:\n&gt; - if everything is OK (no error neither failure), no problem.\n&gt; - if an error appear, no problem\n&gt; - if a failure is detected, THE JVM DOES NOT SHUTDOWN\n&gt;\n&gt; But this pattern depends on TestCases. For e.g., at the end of other\n&gt; TestCases&#39; run, the jvm does not shutdown even every tests are OK.\n&gt;\n&gt; Is this problem a known problem links to junit or a java runtime problem?\n&gt; Is anybody have a solution, an idea?\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks in advance.\n&gt;\n&gt; sylv1\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n=====\n-----------------------------------------\n             Keep it simple...\n(1 Corinthians 2:2, Galatians 2:20, 6:14)\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nSend FREE video emails in Yahoo!
