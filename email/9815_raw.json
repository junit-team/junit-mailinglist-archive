Note\n&gt; that the fixture is not just the objects, but their state as well. \n&gt; You may have instance of the same classes, but with different state\n&gt; (e.g. empty list, one element, two elements...). They are different\n&gt; fixtures and should be in different TestCase subclasses.\n\nQuestion about this.  Obviously each &#39;object&#39; can have its own state \nbut through static attributes each class can have its own state \nalso.  How do you deal with that with reference to this discussion?\n\n&gt; \n&gt; This is a bit of a quibble IMHO.  My point is that you don;t mix\n&gt; fixtures in a single TestCase subclass.... the idea of building\n&gt; TestCase subclasses around distinct fixtures.\n&gt; \n\nMatt Swaffer\n\n\n\n",
