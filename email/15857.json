They were not<br/>\nthe first time, why do you assume they are now?<br/>\n<br/>\nTo make matter worse, you claim:<br/>\n<br/>\nI think some of the people posting here don&#39;t realize just how comprehensive<br/>\nXOM&#39;s test suite is.<br/>\n<br/>\nDon&#39;t you have enough proof that you are overestimating the<br/>\ncomprehensiveness of these tests since they failed to catch two bugs in a<br/>\nshort period of time?<br/>\n<br/>\nNote that I totally understand the necessity to do &quot;hack fixing&quot; when<br/>\ncircumstances warrant it (deadlines, pressing customer, etc...), but<br/>\nrecommending it as a new way of development is irresponsible.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut I guess the best illustration of this point is the following comment<br/>\nfrom one of your readers:<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m having a serious rethink about using XOM.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nCédric<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed] </span></blockquote></div>",
