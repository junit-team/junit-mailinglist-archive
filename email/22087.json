E.g.: run all  tests that are not in (a) certain category(s)? This is probably not difficult add in one way or another onto the concept of categories, but the answer to &quot;which test is now acctually included&quot; could become confusing in cases where a test is in an included and an excluded category. I would like to see something here that does not require a lot of browsing through hierarchies of suites nad categories. This may in my approach not well solved either as suites can extend on other suites: if a referenced suite includes a certain test, it is executed even if the extending suite excludes a test.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd more fundamentally: is the idea/need of exclusion meaningfull or just a result of badly organising tests (I&#39;d say no, but I may be wrong)? <br/>\n<br/>\nCheers,<br/>\n  Georg</div>",
