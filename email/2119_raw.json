B. Rainsberger:\n\nhttp://c2.com/cgi/wiki?JavaUnitBestPractices\n\nI do almost exactly as you suggest.  When writing test methods, I\nfirst write a test method for each exception in the throws cluase of\nthe method.  The only exception I create a catch block for is the\nexception I am expecting for the specific test.  I use a trows\nExcpetion in the test method and let the JUnit framework handle\nanything unexpected that comes up.\n\nI don&#39;t think it is necessary to put an &quot;assertTrue(true);&quot; in the\ncatch block.\n\nAlso, I use a unique naming convention for my test methods:\n\n   test_##_nameofMethodBeingTested\n\n// Test IllegalArgumentException is thrown when account number is\nnull.\npublic void test_00_isAccountAssigned() throws Exception {\n\n    try {\n       boolean assignedStatus =\naccountWorker.isAccountAssigned(null);\n       fail(&quot;IllegalArgumentException should have been thrown&quot;)\n\n    } catch (IllegalArgumentException iae) {\n\n        // Test Succeeds.\n    } \n}\n\n--- Jeff Langr &lt;JLangr@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; I agree with Mr. Duffy and would like to add my thoughts.\n&gt; \n&gt; Your test cases represent controlled contexts that you create.  You\n&gt; need to\n&gt; not only test all the &quot;happy path&quot; scenarios -- the ones where you\n&gt; expect no\n&gt; exceptions should be thrown -- but as well test the scenarios where\n&gt; you\n&gt; *expect* exceptions to be thrown. For example:\n&gt; \n&gt; public void testTooManyPlayersOnField() {\n&gt; \tField field = new Field();\n&gt; \tfor (int i = 0; i &lt; 11; i++)\n&gt; \t\tfield.addPlayer();\n&gt; \ttry {\n&gt; \t\tfield.addPlayer();\n&gt; \t\tfail(&quot;should have thrown exception...&quot;);\n&gt; \t}\n&gt; \tcatch (TooManyPlayersException e) {\n&gt; \t\tassertTrue(true);  // ugh.  &quot;pass()&quot; would be nice\n&gt; \t}\n&gt; }\n&gt; \n&gt; For the happy path tests, I don&#39;t care what exception is thrown --\n&gt; it should\n&gt; never happen under normal circumstances. (If it does, something&#39;s\n&gt; seriously\n&gt; wrong anyway, and JUnit will still catch it.)  So I just declare\n&gt; that my\n&gt; test &quot;throws Exception&quot; where I have to (and use finally clauses\n&gt; when I need\n&gt; to).  That&#39;s the simplest thing that&#39;ll work in the light of Java&#39;s\n&gt; insistence that you deal with the potential for an exception.  \n&gt; \n&gt; Using throws on test methods is fine as long as you document how to\n&gt; deal\n&gt; with all possible inappropriate things that *can* happen.  This\n&gt; documentation is through other tests that force and demonstrate\n&gt; these\n&gt; inappropriate things.  The nice part about this approach is that it\n&gt; pushes\n&gt; developers to learn how to treat exceptions early on.  Kind of like\n&gt; ensuring\n&gt; that you can actually restore from your backup tapes before you\n&gt; actually\n&gt; have to.  Most non-XP code I&#39;ve seen does a poor job of organizing\n&gt; exceptions.  \n&gt; \n&gt; Jeff L.\n&gt; Object Mentor, Inc.\n\n",
