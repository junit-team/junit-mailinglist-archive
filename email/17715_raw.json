We wrapped it. Yes, we had system tests, but in order to test\n&gt;  &gt; our logic independently, we pretty much had to wrap it.\n&gt; \n&gt; I don&#39;t want the tests to be independent of the libraries they depend\n&gt; on. I want them to depend on exactly what the code depends on: no more;\n&gt; no less. That way you find bugs in the boundaries between model classes\n&gt; and libraries as well as in the model classes and libraries themselves.\n\nYou seem to think that&#39;s (1) the only way to do it and (2) the best way \nto do it. I&#39;m not sure that&#39;s always true, which is why I use contract \ntests and interaction tests to perform the same task you perform by \ntesting against the real thing. I do what I do because of the \nimprovements in my design; you what do you do (I presume) because it&#39;s \ncloser to how the thing will be used and you don&#39;t mind the extra cost \nof testing against the real thing. It would be interesting to get to the \nbottom of why so many of us feel testing against the real thing is too \nexpensive and why so many of you feel testing against the real thing is \nworth the cost.\n\n&gt;  &gt; The fact is, testing is a legitmate need. Designing for testability is\n&gt;  &gt; simply good engineering.\n&gt; \n&gt; The tail is wagging the dog. Testing is done to support the project. It\n&gt; is not the project, and it should not control the project.\n\nI find this interesting, considering that many projects do not ship \nuntil their testing phase is complete /or/ feel bad that they ship \nbefore their testing phase is complete. Many projects that do ship \nbefore their testing phase is complete end up shipping shit.\n\nIt seems testing is more than something that supports the project.\n\n&gt; I&#39;ll keep an eye out for such a case in the future, but I don;t recall\n&gt; ever noticing one. I do recall numerous examples where I had trouble\n&gt; testing code that wasn&#39;t intended to be used as a library in the first\n&gt; place. However in all cases I can think of the problems that prevented\n&gt; testing also prevented library usage. The problems were in no way unique\n&gt; to testability, nor did you have to resort to testability to justify\n&gt; fixing the problems,\n\nSo this is one point of commonality: we say &quot;Testable designs tend to be \ngood designs&quot;; you say &quot;Difficult-to-test libraries tend to be \ndifficult-to-use libraries&quot;. Those sound pretty equivalent to me.\n-- \nJ. B.
