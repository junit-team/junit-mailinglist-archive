I often feel \nthe necessity of testing private methods, and have tried the solutions \noffered here.\nFor quite a while I used the static inner classes technique, but found \nthat with time our source files were getting too cluttered.\nI&#39;ve now moved to putting my test cases in a parallel directory with the \nsame package structure, and if I really need to test a private method I \nchange the access to package-private and can then test it directly from \na test class in the same package, but in a different source tree. With a \nfew good Ant targets and/or scripts this works nicely. Still, changing a \nprivate method representing an implementation detail to package-private \nseems to be a code smell!\n\nEric Armstrong wrote:\n&gt; &quot;Mike Colbert &quot; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;&gt; One technique we use, with Java, is to implement our JUnit TestCases\n&gt;&gt;as static inner classes.  This gives you the access you require.  It\n&gt;&gt;also provides other benefits, especially with TDD.  It makes managing\n&gt;&gt;the source a lot easier.  You only have to check in/out one file from\n&gt;&gt;SCM.  That way you never, ahem, forget the test code.  It&#39;s always\n&gt;&gt;married to the app code.  This helps enforce a mindset that the test\n&gt;&gt;code is just as important as the app code.  And it&#39;s really\n&gt;&gt;comfortable to bounce up and down the single file in your editor as\n&gt;&gt;you iterate between writing test code and app code.  Deployment is\n&gt;&gt;not a problem, since inner classes are compiled into seperate class\n&gt;&gt;files, using the AppClass$TestClass.class naming convention.\n-- \n---------------------------------------------------------\n  Jentro AG\n  John L.
