Actually let me qualify that. It is not a good book unless\n&gt; &gt; you are heavily into EJB. It angles itself towards EJB using\n&gt; &gt; several different tools; however in each case you just get started\n&gt; &gt; and it jumps topics. So in that sense it is an intro book - just a\n&gt; &gt; bit too much intro and not enough meat (using the word mastering \nis\n&gt; &gt; just a cruel joke). \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; A more correct title would have been &quot;EJB using XP and Open Source\n&gt; &gt; Tools&quot;. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; A very disappointing book.\n&gt; \n&gt; Just wanted to make clear that you seem to be talking about &quot;Java \nTools\n&gt; for Extreme Programming&quot; here, not about the book in the subject?!\n&gt; I am looking for a book like &quot;introduction to unit testing&quot; any \nrecommedations ? I have just read &quot;Extreme Programming Explained&quot; by \nKent Beck which was an inspiring read and have used junit and jfunc a \nbit but need more guidance - if you know what I mean.\n&gt; Ilja\n\n\n\n",
