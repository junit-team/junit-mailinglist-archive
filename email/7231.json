You don&#39;t have the chance to test their stuff, so you can&#39;t trust it in production, even though I counsel in favor of trusting it during development.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo said  Michael Silverstein  on  3/14/2003 --------------------<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Good observation about using deduction to locate points of failure. Not<br/>\n&gt;to be picky, I tend to view statements about the possibility of never<br/>\n&gt;needing to trace code based on small scale examples, as similar to<br/>\n&gt;concluding that you don&#39;t need sight to drive on highways because of<br/>\n&gt;success traversing one&#39;s driveway with one&#39;s eyes closed. I agree with<br/>\n&gt;Steven below that the strategy you take depends on your context.<br/>\n&gt;Fine-grained test cases may reduce the need for tracing code with<br/>\n&gt;debuggers but with any sufficiently complex application, especially one<br/>\n&gt;that interacts with questionably documented 3rd party or system APIs, a<br/>\n&gt;debugger will at some point become invaluable in determining the cause<br/>\n&gt;of failure.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;-----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;Mike Silverstein<br/>\n&gt;SilverMark, Inc.<br/>\n&gt;The Object Testing Company<br/>\n&gt;www.javatesting.com<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt;&gt; From: J. B. Rainsberger [mailto:jbrains@...] <br/>\n&gt;&gt; <br/>\n&gt;&gt; I completed my first professional Ruby project a week ago. It <br/>\n&gt;&gt; was nothing big: three weeks of Saturdays -- but it was my <br/>\n&gt;&gt; first professional project with a dynamically-typed language <br/>\n&gt;&gt; with no type checker. This caused me some problems, just <br/>\n&gt;&gt; because I&#39;m not used to it. I usually say, &quot;The compiler just <br/>\n&gt;&gt; stops me from making mistakes that I don&#39;t make anyway.&quot; I <br/>\n&gt;&gt; suppose that&#39;s not quite right for me.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; <br/>\n&gt;&gt; Anyhow, that&#39;s just a lead-in to my comment. In many cases, I <br/>\n&gt;&gt; would have either an unexpected &#39;nil&#39; value, or an object <br/>\n&gt;&gt; that doesn&#39;t understand an expected message. My first <br/>\n&gt;&gt; instinct is to get in there with &quot;p this&quot; and &quot;p that&quot;... <br/>\n&gt;&gt; then I thought of this: if I have a &#39;nil&#39; object over here, <br/>\n&gt;&gt; then there must be a bug over there... and when I started <br/>\n&gt;&gt; writing tests checking that results are non-nil over there, I <br/>\n&gt;&gt; no longer needed to trace my code.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; <br/>\n&gt;&gt; I&#39;m still learning.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; <br/>\n&gt;&gt; So said steven.hale@... on 3/13/2003 --------------------<br/>\n&gt;&gt; <br/>\n&gt;&gt; My debugging habits are usually something like this:<br/>\n&gt;&gt; <br/>\n&gt;&gt; 1. Read the error message (if there is one)<br/>\n&gt;&gt; 2. Think<br/>\n&gt;&gt; 3. Read the log<br/>\n&gt;&gt; 4. Think<br/>\n&gt;&gt; 5. Write a unit test<br/>\n&gt;&gt; 6. Launch the debugger<br/>\n&gt;&gt; <br/>\n&gt;&gt; Since adopting junit (2 -3 years ago) I can honestly say I&#39;ve <br/>\n&gt;&gt; not yet been forced down to level 6! I try to encourage <br/>\n&gt;&gt; programmers in my team not to start at 6 first.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; <br/>\n&gt;&gt; Judging by the varied responses there&#39;s clearly a whole range <br/>\n&gt;&gt; of other successful strategies - maybe it&#39;s related to the <br/>\n&gt;&gt; type of application being programmed.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; <br/>\n&gt;&gt; Steven<br/>\n&gt;&gt; <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;---<br/>\n&gt;Outgoing mail is certified Virus Free.<br/>\n&gt;Checked by AVG anti-virus system (http://www.grisoft.com).<br/>\n&gt;Version: 6.0.459 / Virus Database: 258 - Release Date: 2/25/2003<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:<br/>\n&gt;junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Your use of Yahoo!
