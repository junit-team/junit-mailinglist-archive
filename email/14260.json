    "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1594394990\">#: by Elliotte Harold&#39;s words the mind was *winged* :#<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I&#39;ve been experimenting with JUnit 4 and mostly I like it. I do have a <br/>\n&gt; few questions:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 1. If there are multiple @Before annotated methods in a class, are any <br/>\n&gt; guarantees made about what order they are invoked in? Same question for <br/>\n&gt; @After, @BeforeClass, and @AfterClass.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Short answer is: no. JUnit is known for the fact that you cannot order the way your methods will be <br/>\ninvoked.<br/>\n<br/>\nTestNG is offering a logical ordering through dependency definitions (dependsOnGroups and <br/>\ndependsOnMethods that can be used on both configuration methods (JUnit name for them is @Before, <br/>\n@After, etc) and for test methods.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; 2. Is there any way to control the order in which tests are run? Or is <br/>\n&gt; that pretty much still up to the test runner like in JUnit 3?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>same as above.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; 3. Is there any equivalent to the suite() method in JUnit 3? i.e. how do <br/>\n&gt; I bundle up several different test classes so they can be run as a group?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>don&#39;t know. i would like to find out.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; 4. Java 5 is obviously required to build JUnit 4. Can it nonetheless run <br/>\n&gt; in Java 1.4? or is Java 5 pretty much required for anything that uses <br/>\n&gt; JUnit 4?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It cannot run on any JDK prior to 1.5 because it is based only on annotations. You can take a look <br/>\nat TestNG which instead is able to run in both 1.5 and prior 1.5<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; 5. The GUI test runners don&#39;t appear to be in Version4 CVS. Will they <br/>\n&gt; return at some point?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>afaik no.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; 6. Why are Assert.failSame, Assert.failNotSame, Assert.failNotEquals(), <br/>\n&gt; and Assert.format now public?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Any light anyone can shed on these questions would be appreciated. Thanks!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n </span></blockquote>i can see why failSame, failNotSame and failNotEquals can be public. You may use them. Not sure <br/>\nabout format.<br/>\n<br/>\ncheers,<br/>\n:alex |.::the_mindstorm::.|</div>",
