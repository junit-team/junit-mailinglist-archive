You <br/>\nhave also failed to consider that in some countries Google is not <br/>\nnecessarily a buzz-word, so the question may not be directed there.  I <br/>\ndon&#39;t mean to say that I know for a fact that either of these things is <br/>\nthe case, but I think it&#39;s worth the consideration that it may be the <br/>\ncase -- in which case it is a fine and expected thing to see the same <br/>\n&quot;newbie&quot; question 10, 20, or even 30 times in a month.<br/>\n<br/>\nI too get tired of the same ol&#39; questions, but the same ol&#39; response of <br/>\na Google search is valid and, at the very least, polite.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJason Rogers<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I,<br/>\nbut Christ liveth in me: and the life which I now live in<br/>\nthe flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved<br/>\nme, and gave himself for me.&quot;<br/>\n    Galatians 2:20</div>",
