If it ain&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; the right exception, then the production code is barfing. Barfing is an\n&gt; &gt; error -- different from, say, answering 10 instead of 8.\n&gt;\n&gt; what about mixed language environment? I mean CORBA / Java or \n&gt; something like this... CORBA exceptions should be proccessed in Java,\n&gt;  catched.... so I think checked exceptions are better, they AWARE \n&gt; programmers of majority of possible exception. They are part of \n&gt; method contracts. I FLAME :+)\n\nI agree that checked exceptions give the compiler an opportunity to make \npeople aware of exceptions that code expects to throw. Even so:\n\n1. I don&#39;t need the compiler to do all this work for me. Often it gets in my \nway.\n2. When I refactor, I have to worry about the ripple effect of all these damn \ndeclared exceptions. Anything that makes refactoring difficult, tedious or \nannoying is, in my opinion, a Bad Thing unless it delivers real value in the \nmeantime.\n\nI am not convinced that, overall, the value delivered by checked exceptions \nis greater than the cost.\n\nOn my current project, which of course includes database access, the entry \npoint into the data access objects throws only unchecked exceptions. If our \ndata access object encounters an SQLException, it wraps that in an \nObjectStoreException. These are unexpected problems and catastrophic errors. \nWhen we throw an exception from within the data access object, we throw a \nsubclass of ObjectStoreException, such as EntityNotFoundException, \nEntityInUseException, DuplicateEntityException. None of these exceptions are \nchecked.\n\nWe don&#39;t miss a thing. If we had checked exceptions everywhere, we would run \nthe risk of coupling our service code with our data access code. Bad Thing.\n\nDoes the compiler have as much information to help us uncover unhandled \nexceptions? No. \n\nThat&#39;s why we have tests. The compiler ain&#39;t so damn smart, anyhow.\n\n--\nJ. B.
