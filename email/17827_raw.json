Give it some HTML \n&gt;with a missing &lt;/td&gt; tag and it will silently provide one for you.\n&gt;All this has done is to relieve thousands of web developers from the \n&gt;responsibility of ensuring that they produce correct markup.\n&gt;It really is a case of treating the symptoms whilst allowing the \n&gt;disease to spread in an unchecked manner.\n&gt;#5 covers a vast majority of cases - as Michael points our, we deal \n&gt;with &#39;terms and conditions&#39; in so many other parts of our life, why \n&gt;not do so whlst carry out our chosen profession.\n&gt;\n&gt;Bob\n&gt;\n&gt;P.S. If we were to implement #1, surely it would be documented by #5?\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\n#1 is usually a bad choice, but there are narrow cases where it \napplies.  There are some systems that have to run continuously, and \nmunging a bad request into an action is far better than doing nothing or \nstopping.  I agree through, that is bad in general.\n\nIE is an interesting case.  Microsoft could have taken a hard line, and \nyes we probably would have been better off, but I&#39;m guessing that the \nreason they developed tolerance for bad input was purely competitive.\n\nOn #5, I mentioned earlier that my preference is to give users of an API \na better experience.  I do think it&#39;s interesting, though, that this \nissue of whether an API should be permissive leads to discussions that \nparallel contemporary politics: should rules be enforced strictly?  \nShould people be accountable for their own actions?  If they aren&#39;t, \nwill it lead to bad behavior?\n\nLawrence Lessig wrote a while ago that code is law in a way, so I guess \nit makes sense that these issues come up.\n\n\nMichael Feathers\nwww.objectmentor.com\n\n",
