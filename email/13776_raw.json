However, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; exception detail messages make extremely poor\n&gt; error messages.\n\nWe have to translate every exception, which is quite a\nlot of work.\n\nIn my experience only very few of our exceptions make\nsense to translate them.\n\nAn example for a exception which should be translated\nis MeanwhileChangedException. It is raised if there is\na conflict in persisting data by different users, much\nlike a CVS conflict. Believe it or not, in 999 of 1000\ncases, the exception is not thrown because another\nuser has changed the data but because of ones own\nprogramming bugs.\n\nAt least exceptions, which are subclassed of\nRuntimeException need not to be translated, since they\nare a kind of SystemException and no\nApplicationExceptions. This kind of exception would\nhelp no user but only the programmers.\n\nI think that the majority of exceptions will not be\nuseful to read for the users, even if they are\ntranslated.\n\nIt creates a lot of overhead to use exception keys,\nunique exception numbers, exception message templates\nwith placeholders, exception constructors with\nparameters to fill the placeholders, and of course the\nwork needed for the translation of all these messages.\n\nMaybe it is better to leave all exceptions without\ntranslation support. I think it is easier to integrate\nthe messages and translation in a layer above the\nexceptions. As I said, only a small percentage of all\nexceptions and exception messages is useful for a user.\n\n\n\t\t\n__________________________________ \nDiscover Yahoo! \nHave fun online with music videos, cool games, IM and more.
