When these attributes are &quot;no&quot;, the\n&gt; &gt;  log4j output is captured by the &lt;junit&gt; task in the XML output as\n&gt; &gt;  expected.  When these attributes are &quot;yes&quot;, the log4j output is not\n&gt; &gt;  captured, although direct output to System.out is.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt;  I can see where this attribute might effect the output, however, I\n&gt; &gt;  would imagine the effect being the opposite.  For example, when not\n&gt; &gt;  forking a new JVM, I could see where the log4j loaded by JUnit would\n&gt; &gt;  be shared with the log4j loaded by ANT and there might be some\n&gt; &gt;  interference.  When the process is forked however, I do not see how\n&gt; &gt;  there would be a negative interaction.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt;  I&#39;d appreciate any enlightment :-)\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt;  Thanks,\n&gt; &gt;  Ray\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; Have you posted to the ant list?\n\nI haven&#39;t had a chance yet, will try later today.\n\nThis is still an issue for me as if I do not fork the tests, I end up\nwith an out of memory exception.\n\nThanks,\nRay\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
