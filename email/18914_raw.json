I would like to run a\n&gt;=\r\n single test\n&gt; &gt; that exists in a test case.  A co-worker of mine is using =\r\nEclipse\n&gt; 3.1.2 and\n&gt; &gt; is able to successfully do this.  Eclipse 3.2.1 act=\r\ns and displays\n&gt; results as\n&gt; &gt; though one test was run.  However, console =\r\noutput reveals that all\n&gt; tests in\n&gt; &gt; the TestCase class are being run.  \n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; From what I can tell, the only way to run an individual test is to\n=\r\n&gt; right-click on the test&#39;s name in the &quot;Outline&quot; view pane.\n&gt;\n\n\nIt may als=\r\no be done using the Navigator.  However, this is a problem \nwith Eclipse 3.=\r\n2.0 (I originally posted 3.2.1, but this was \nincorrect) and JUnit 4.1.  Da=\r\nvid suggested running the test using \nJUnit 3 and this provided a great wor=\r\nk-around.\n\nI have reported this to Eclipse and am awaiting a response.\n\n\n",
