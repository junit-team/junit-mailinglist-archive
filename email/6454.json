For example, a CalculatorEngine.java and<br/>\nCalculatorEngineTest.java (extended from TestCase) in parallel<br/>\ndirectories so that they&#39;re in the same package. When we we&#39;ve written a<br/>\nfew tests and find that some setup code is repeated in more than one test<br/>\nclass (often because it&#39;s setting up a mock database or file system) that<br/>\ngoes into something we call a XxxxTestUtility class - maybe<br/>\nOracleTestUtility.java.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m wondering if our TestUtility is what you&#39;re calling a fixture even<br/>\ntho it doesn&#39;t extend TestCase. This class will setup the sometimes<br/>\ncomplicated objects, often instantiating several objects and setting<br/>\ntheir state. It&#39;s methods are then called by the test classes that extend<br/>\nTestCase and are called in test suites. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe still have a one-to-one correspondence of test classes to production<br/>\nclasses which seems to help make sure that we test everything. And tells<br/>\nus where to look for code that tests a given class. If it matters, this<br/>\nproject was started a few years before we&#39;d heard of unit tests and long<br/>\nbefore test driven development reached us.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn Sat, 14 Dec 2002 16:55:56 -0500 &quot;J.

A TestCase is the embodiment of a *fixture*... <br/>\n&gt; a<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; specific context in which tests are run.  As such it should <br/>\n&gt; contain<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; only those tests (i.e. test methods) which run in the context of <br/>\n&gt; the<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; fixture that the TestCase embodies.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  [...]<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;I entirely agree that TestCases are (despite the name) intended to<br/>\n&gt; &gt;represent fixtures, and that mindlessly creating one TestCase per<br/>\n&gt; &gt;class under test is a Bad Thing.  Your example in a subsequent<br/>\n&gt; &gt;post of separate TestCases for a list implementation illustrates<br/>\n&gt; &gt;the point quite nicely.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;However, I think there are cases in which it is sensible to have<br/>\n&gt; &gt;one TestCase for one class.  For example, suppose we have a<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Comparator which sorts Integers lexicographically according to<br/>\n&gt; &gt;their written-out forms in English.  The class has no internal<br/>\n&gt; &gt;state; all instances are equivalent.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Certainly: if there is no commonality of setup, then there may be <br/>\n&gt; no<br/>\n&gt; motivation whatever to separate test methods into many test cases.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;We might take the view that, when a TestCase is closely tied to a<br/>\n&gt; &gt;single class this way, the fixture under test consists simply of<br/>\n&gt; &gt;the class itself (rather than an instance with some specific<br/>\n&gt; &gt;state).  If there is nothing else in common among the test<br/>\n&gt; &gt;methods, it is not unreasonable to leave them all in the same<br/>\n&gt; &gt;TestCase, rather than, say, putting each in its own TestCase.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I can find no argument against this.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; J.
