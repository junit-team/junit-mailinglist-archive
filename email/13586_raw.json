I did a spreadsheet and \ngot as far as formulas and cell references. I didn&#39;t get as far as a \nGUI, but I could have with a little more time.\n\nThis was more of a demo than a tutorial and it went very well.\n\n\nInspiration came from an exercise Bill Wake did a couple of years back\n\nhttp://groups.yahoo.com/group/extremeprogramming/message/41017\n\n\nKevin\n\n\ndidoss@... wrote:\n&gt; I&#39;d go for some basic checkbook program (like a really stripped down Quicken, or the likes) - as everybody understands that,...or some similar concept that is familiar in an everyday life, and therefore easy to explain.\n&gt; \n&gt; If you stick with something that is really scalable, then you (or they) can scale to any level,...for both functionality and GUI.\n&gt; \n&gt; For functionality - small scale is text file of data with basic command line options to input/retrieve data (deposit, withdrawal, balance),...medium scale is maybe still flat file data with more diverse command options (max/min/avg balance),...even add in functionality to put your data in buckets (descretionary/mandatory spending; type of spending - groceries, books, clothes, recreation, etc) to be able to drill down to different levels - &quot;how much money did I spend each quarter at the bookstore buying new books on Java, JUnit, etc.?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; For GUI - small scale is various command line options to input/retrieve data,...medium scale is mildly interesting GUI to ease input/retrieval,...work your way up to a better GUI with some bells and whistles,...even add in functionality to do bars, graphs, etc. - &quot;how much money did I spend each quarter at the bookstore buying new books on Java, JUnit, etc.?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; -------------- Original message -------------- \n&gt; I&#39;m developing a course on test driven development and JUnit. This \n&gt; course will be taught in a variety of formats and lengths ranging from \n&gt; 90-minute seminar to one or two day hands on tutorial to a traditional \n&gt; university setting. Obviously how much I can cover and how deep I can go \n&gt; will vary depending on format, length, and audience level.\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m wondering if anyone has any good ideas for examples to use in this \n&gt; course? Ideally I&#39;d like something that&#39;s simple enough to do in a day, \n&gt; but still gives attendees a feeling that they&#39;ve developed something \n&gt; real. I could possibly do something involving the Mandelbrot set or \n&gt; cellular automata. However, I&#39;d prefer something a little less \n&gt; mathematical if possible.\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;d like it to have a GUI component, but at the same time I&#39;d like that \n&gt; to show up fairly late in the application, and for the application to \n&gt; still make sense if there&#39;s not time to cover testing GUIs.\n&gt; \n&gt; It should be possible to develop this program on a laptop not connected \n&gt; to the Internet. i.e. no databases access, network communications, web \n&gt; services, the U.S. tax code, and so forth.\n&gt; \n&gt; Students will have a wide variety of backgrounds so I want to avoid any \n&gt; special knowledge of subjects like XML processing, financial \n&gt; derivatives, quantum physics, and so forth. I should be able to cover \n&gt; the background necessary to start writing the program in 10 minutes or \n&gt; less.\n&gt; \n&gt; Any ideas?\n&gt; \n\n",
