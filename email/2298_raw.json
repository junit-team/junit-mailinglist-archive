It has \nbeen renamed Cactus, donated to the Apache Software Foundation and \nhas begun a new existence there. It is now a fully functional unit \ntesting framework for server side java code. URL: \nhttp://jakarta.apache.org/commons/cactus\n\n* Cactus has chosen an in-container approach to unit testing, meaning \nthat your unit tests (JUnit like) are executed within your servlet \nengine. The other approach, as mentionned by Robert is to use Mock \nObjects. To understand the in and out of In-Container vs Mock Objects \nI would suggest you read \nhttp://jakarta.apache.org/commons/cactus/mockobjects.html which is an \nunbiased (I think !) comparison of both approaches.\n\nHave fun !\n-Vincent Massol\n\n\n--- In junit@y..., Paul Hodgetts &lt;prh@z...&gt; wrote:\n[snip]\n&gt; I was looking at, IIRC, J2EEUnit which seems to have mocks for the \nHTTP\n&gt; request and session as part of its framework.  But I didn&#39;t get \nvery far\n&gt; with it at the time.  Easy Mock sounds cool, I&#39;ll have to take a \nlook.\n&gt; \n&gt; Anyone have any experiences with J2EEUnit, or with otherwise \nsimulating\n&gt; HTTP sessions and responses?\n&gt; \n[snip]\n\n\n\n",
