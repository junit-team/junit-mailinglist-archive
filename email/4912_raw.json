So please explain: What tests do you need to \n&gt; suf=\r\nficiently test \n&gt; &gt; &gt; every possible implementation of this interface? How =\r\ndid you find \n&gt; &gt; &gt; them?\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; You test for the contracts.\n&gt; &gt; [ex=\r\nample of testing for the contract snipped]\n&gt; \n&gt; So you are saying you don&#39;t=\r\n really care wether your tests are \n&gt; sufficient but let the users find out=\r\n which tests are missing?\n&gt; \n&gt; I think I must still be misunderstanding you=\r\n...\n\nBefore I make a final release, my code is tested by other developers.\n=\r\nThose developers help me find the missing areas.\n\nBut keep in mind, if we h=\r\nave written a test for every conceivable\nmethod we can come up with--someon=\r\ne, somewhere will have a situation\nwhere something fails to behave as expec=\r\nted.  Any time we have something\nthat does not behave as expected we have a=\r\n failure or bug.  Not behaving\nas expected can be that it takes longer to p=\r\nrocess than expected, the\nlog entry doesn&#39;t have the information expected, =\r\nor something more\nserious.\n\nI apply agile tactics to my testcases.  That me=\r\nans I write what I need\nwhen I need it.  Just like we can get stuck in anly=\r\nsis paralysis, we can\nalso get stuck in testing paralysis.  I start out by =\r\ntesting what I need\nto enforce.  If there is something that can obviously b=\r\ne a sticking\npoint,\nI will write a test for that.\n\nHowever, what I am refer=\r\nring to with regression testing is that you\nmiss things.  You find that som=\r\nething needs to be tested that you were\nnot aware needed to be tested.  At =\r\nthat point, you write the testcase\nthat reproduces the error *before* you f=\r\nix it.\n\n\n\n",
