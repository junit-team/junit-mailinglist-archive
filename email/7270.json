Since we currently have more than 500 test cases it is<br/>\n&gt;&gt; difficult to do this manually. It would of course be easy if the<br/>\n&gt;&gt; normal success rate was 100%, but a number of test cases fail since<br/>\n&gt;&gt; the implementation is not yet completed.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Funny I discussed that with Bill Venners a few days ago.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\nYes, Vladimir and I did talk about this last week over turkey burgers. <br/>\nWe spent most of the lunch comparing Vladimir&#39;s JUnit Add-Ons with <br/>\nSuiteRunner. It turns out we were both trying to address many of the <br/>\nsame issues when we built our respective JUnit extensions.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Your problem is that not all of your tests pass.  So my question is: <br/>\n&gt; how can a<br/>\n&gt; developer be sure that he didn&#39;t introduce a bug with some new code?  <br/>\n&gt; X tests<br/>\n&gt; were failing before the modification and now Y tests are failing.  If <br/>\n&gt; Y&gt;X you<br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t know which one is/are now failing.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; IMO opinion (and in your case) you have two kinds of failing tests:<br/>\n&gt; - the one that shouldn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; - the one that will, and it&#39;s ok (testing not implemented features, not<br/>\n&gt; implemented tests)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; JUnit doesn&#39;t directly give you the possibility to separate the &quot;good&quot; <br/>\n&gt; from the<br/>\n&gt; &quot;bad&quot; failing tests.  You have to come up with your own solution.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; What I would do:<br/>\n&gt; - rename the tests that should fail testXYZ_failing<br/>\n&gt; - rewrite some JUnit components (it depends what kind of runner you&#39;re <br/>\n&gt; using<br/>\n&gt; (ant, swing, textui) to filter these tests<br/>\n&gt; - or write an XSLT file to process the XML and remove the &#39;_failing&#39; <br/>\n&gt; methods<br/>\n&gt; from the report<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\nI had never imagined this kind of problem before talking to Vladimir, <br/>\nbut this morning I realized that it sounds like a good candidate for a <br/>\ncustom reporter. If you use SuiteRunner as your JUnit runner, you can <br/>\ncreate a custom reporter that I think will solve your problem. This <br/>\nreporter should:<br/>\n<br/>\n1. Record persistently (in a database or file, for example) the tests <br/>\nthat fail.<br/>\n2. Open up the persistent record of failed tests from the previous run, <br/>\ncompare that with the current set of failed tests, and indicate the <br/>\ndifferences to the user.<br/>\n<br/>\nA couple weeks ago I published an article about how to create a custom <br/>\nreporter that should get you started:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.artima.com/suiterunner/xmlreporter.html\">http://www.artima.com/suiterunner/xmlreporter.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\nIf you run into trouble, please post to the SuiteRunner forum and we&#39;ll <br/>\ntry and help:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.artima.com/forums/forum.jsp?forum=61\">http://www.artima.com/forums/forum.jsp?forum=61</a><br/>\n<br/>\nBill<br/>\n--<br/>\nBill Venners<br/>\nArtima Software, Inc.<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.artima.com\">http://www.artima.com</a> </span></blockquote></div>",
