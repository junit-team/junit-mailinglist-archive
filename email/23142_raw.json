Our new lawyers seem to be concerned about the JU=\r\nnit license. True, JUnit&#39;s use of Common Public License is unique and sort =\r\nof archaic. I don&#39;t know about any other (important) project using this lic=\r\nense anymore.\n\nRight now we are holding our release and getting ready to re=\r\nmove JUnit from our standard installation. Silly, I know, JUnit is necessar=\r\ny part of any serious Java development, but there is not much we can do. Ex=\r\ncept to ask:\n\nDon&#39;t you want to relicense JUnit to some more commonly used =\r\nlicense? EPL would be fine. At least I have not heard any complain about EP=\r\nL from our new lawyers yet. Dual licensing to CPL & EPL probably too.\n\nThan=\r\nks for reading my post and sorry for bothering. It just make me sad to see =\r\nour software being crippled due to artificial licensing constraints.\n\nOn be=\r\nhalf of about 800000 active users of NetBeans IDE,\nJaroslav Tulach\nNetBeans=\r\n Platform Architect\n\n\n\n",
