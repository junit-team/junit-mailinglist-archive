B. Rainsberger<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;  &gt; Agreed, TestNG supports this out of the box, but for every<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; neat feature TestNG supports out of the box there will be 20<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; people crying about this other neat feature it doesn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; support...<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Uh, that&#39;s quite a bold statement.  I have certainly not heard anything like<br/>\n&gt; this on our mailing-list...<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Wait until you have 100,000 users. :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  &gt; it&#39;s for that reason that JUnit doesn&#39;t even try. :)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; My impression is that JUnit doesn&#39;t try simply because its authors didn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; envision that this feature would one day be needed.  Nothing wrong with<br/>\n&gt; that, you can&#39;t always predict what the future will hold.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Perhaps, but Kent has said quite publicly that he and Erich intended <br/>\nJUnit to be the /intersection/, not the /union/, of the feature sets <br/>\npeople demanded.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  &gt; One big difference between the two is that JUnit assumes that<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; the test suite is computed before the first test runs, and I<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; admit that is a fundamental and useful difference between<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; JUnit and TestNG. I suppose once TestNG has a large user base<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; we&#39;ll have a clearer idea how important that is. (I know that<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; day is approaching!)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Thanks for the vote of confidence :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You&#39;re welcome. I see the flurry of testers being told to use JUnit to <br/>\ndo integration testing and retrofit tests to legacy code. There are two <br/>\nfundamental differences in how things might proceed once they find out <br/>\nJUnit makes testing those code annoying:<br/>\n<br/>\n1. They&#39;ll recognize that their design has something to do with it and <br/>\nstart refactoring towards more testability.<br/>\n<br/>\n2. They&#39;ll be pointed at TestNG, which makes it much easier to deal with <br/>\nthose design issues while they decide when to do #1.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m really glad that the community has a clear alternative to JUnit, and <br/>\none designed to augment it without necessarily trying to drive it out. <br/>\nCommendable.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  &gt; You could say that marker annotations are &quot;merely&quot; syntax<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; sugar replacing marker interfaces. That said, syntax sugar<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; done well is very nice. Also, annotations were /designed/ for<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; this kind of thing, and interfaces weren&#39;t. Interfaces are<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; not metadata, even if they can be metadata. My butter knife<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; can be a screwdriver, but that doesn&#39;t mean I should avoid<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; buying a screwdriver.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Well put.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Occasionally I do hit upon something. :)<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJ.
