But first you have to decide which aspect(s) of the gui you want to<br/>\n&gt;&gt; test. For many people, making the gui so stupid that it can&#39;t<br/>\n&gt;&gt; possibly break<br/>\n&gt;&gt; and having it delegate to a class that can be unit tested, is sufficient.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Most GUI&#39;s I&#39;ve seen change their appearance and behavior based on the state<br/>\n&gt; of the underlying objects (widgets enabled/disabled, hidden/shown, values<br/>\n&gt; changed in labels, text, tables etc.). When you are testing it is important<br/>\n&gt; to be able to ensure that the connection between the GUI and the rest of the<br/>\n&gt; code has been defined correctly.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I agree 100% that this needs to be tested. The question is, where should we<br/>\ntest it?<br/>\n<br/>\nIf we put this logic in the gui layer, it becomes difficult to test and the<br/>\ncode becomes hard to maintain because every event listener ends up knowing<br/>\nabout every control. Mediator solves that problem.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut if we use Mediator to decouple the gui controls, we may as well delegate<br/>\neverything to the Mediator and leave the gui stupid. The Mediator can be<br/>\nunit tested just like any other class, and doesn&#39;t need the gui since all<br/>\ncommunication is done through interfaces.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nRobert Koss, Ph.D.     | Training, Mentoring, Contract Development<br/>\nSenior Consultant      | Object Oriented Design, C++, Java<br/>\nwww.objectmentor.com   | Extreme Programming</div>",
