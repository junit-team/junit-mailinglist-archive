I&#39;m new to unit testing so please bear with me. I have a\n&gt; method that contains a lot of try and catch statements:\n&gt; \n&gt; try{\n&gt; \tstatement1\n&gt; \tstatement2\n&gt; }\n&gt; catch(ExceptionType1 e1){\n&gt; \tSystem.err.println(&quot;The following exception occurred &quot; +\n&gt; e1.toString());\n&gt; }\n&gt; \n&gt; I know that this is not a very good way of handling exceptions but I&#39;m\n&gt; struggling to find a better way. Another alternative is to use a logger\n&gt; such as log4j, but this does not help much. The problem is how do I test\n&gt; if the method is not working properly, as the exception was caught and\n&gt; won&#39;t be visible to JUnit.\n&gt; \n&gt; The most obvious solution would be to let the method throw all\n&gt; exceptions that are generated. The problem is that there are 5 or 6\n&gt; different types of exceptions that this method can generate and this\n&gt; seems to make my code very messy.\n&gt; \n&gt; Could anyone please tell me what is the proper approach to this, or\n&gt; refer me to any relevant reading.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks in advance.\n&gt; Pico\n&gt; \n\nSeems to me you have three options. Which one you choose will depend on \nwhat the intent of your code is.\n\n1) You could just let the exceptions propagate up. The two previous \nresponses assumed that this was an option for you. It may not be.\n\nBut if, for whatever reason, you can&#39;t propagate the exceptions...\n\n2)  If it is not important that statement2/3/4/5 execute and all you are \ngoing to do is log the failure, just put a single try catch around the \nwhole method*.\n\n3) Do what you are doing now except*\n\n* Instead of writing to System.err, write to a log. Write a unit test \nthat checks the contents of the log after a failure.\n\nKevin\n\n",
