The\nresponse time was not immediate but was not too bad.\n\nI was pairing with a guy in US and I am in NZ :-) I was using a\ndevelopment build of netbeans only because we were working on ruby/rails\ncode and wanted the syntax highlighting ... but I also had it working\non 5.5the latest production build.\n\nAnyway, thought I&#39;d mention it in case others are interested.\n\nCheers\nShane\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\n \n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n",
