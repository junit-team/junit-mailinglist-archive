I try very hard to not actually write to<br/>\nthe database, and leave that for automated integration tests*.  My unit<br/>\ntests use some kind of mock framework to simply verify that the code<br/>\nthat *I* wrote made the calls to the framework that I expected it to<br/>\nmake.  Then I depend on the framework to do the right thing in the<br/>\n&#39;real&#39; case.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou&#39;ll get problems if you misunderstand how to use the framework, but<br/>\nthat&#39;s something best caught in integration tests, especially when<br/>\nyou&#39;re talking about having to restart JVMs.  <br/>\n<br/>\nKevin<br/>\n<br/>\n*Currently our &#39;integration tests&#39; are achieved through monkey-based<br/>\nautomation.  That is, our smart QA people must behave like trained<br/>\nmonkeys and execute scripts for our applications &quot;automatically&quot; when<br/>\nwe have a new build.  I recommend avoiding this route in favor of<br/>\nautomation tools or real monkeys.  We&#39;re evaluating the former<br/>\ncurrently, although I&#39;m advocating the latter.  If you can&#39;t have fun<br/>\nat work, why work?  Philistines.<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!
