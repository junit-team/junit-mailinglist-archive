As Kent Beck says, if<br/>\n&gt;&gt; you follow TDD religiously, you should have 100% statement coverage<br/>\n&gt;&gt; for your code. Let me repeat that: 100%.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Yes, Kent Beck indeed did say, &quot;TDD followed religiously should result<br/>\n&gt;in 100% statement coverage.&quot; But on the other hand, the sentence<br/>\n&gt;before that in his TDD book is &quot;Statement coverage is certainly not a<br/>\n&gt;sufficient measure of test quality, but it is a starting place.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>To me, the bottom line with Test Coverage is that it is a &quot;negative<br/>\nmetric&quot;. Low test coverage is an indicator of failure; but high test<br/>\ncoverage is not an indicator of success. Your code could be<br/>\nhighly-covered by failing tests, after all. ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s why we need skilled testers: to fill in the gaps between<br/>\nCustomer Tests (too high-level, often miss boundary conditions) and<br/>\nProgrammer Tests (very low-level, often miss integration problems).<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nJ.
