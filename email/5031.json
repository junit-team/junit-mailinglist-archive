Also, you might want to make that &quot;catch (Throwable t)&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t agree.  You should catch (&lt;exceptions declared in throw<br/>\nclause&gt;).<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; On this point, does anybody here catches Throwables inside his code?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t!<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I do. Even if not *supposed* to. Because when I &quot;try&quot; <br/>\n&gt; something, I want nothing to crap out except possibly that <br/>\n&gt; thing, and I want to know about it.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You could log it, so that you know a given problem has occurred, then<br/>\nyou could look at the resons that caused the error to fix the bug.  But<br/>\nyou should then let the error filter up the chain to be handled by the<br/>\ncorrect error handler, or even halt the JVM process if it comes to that.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; For exemple, if there is a classpath problem preventing me to <br/>\n&gt; do X(), I want to catch the NoClassDefFoundError, log the <br/>\n&gt; error, and invoke my recovery strategy (msg to user, <br/>\n&gt; alternate method, etc..), Not let the error go all the way to <br/>\n&gt; the top and possibly stop some important top-level task (or <br/>\n&gt; worse the entire jvm process).<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>In this example, I would not catch Throwable, then.  I would catch<br/>\nNoClassDefFoundError.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe only place where I /may/ catch Throwable explicitly, is at the very<br/>\ntop of the call stack (main(), or some run() method), where I log the<br/>\nerror before gracefully shutting down, or start some other recovery<br/>\nstrategy.  However, this should only be done when a recovery strategy is<br/>\navailable.  What do you do in the case of an OutOfMemoryError? (There<br/>\nare several solutions to this problem, but I won&#39;t mention them here.)<br/>\n<br/>\nManuel Amago.</div>",
