The problem<br/>\n&gt; is that most of the solutions we&#39;ve come across (VNC, Citrix,<br/>\n&gt; Microsoft) are either too sluggish to present the ideal illusion that<br/>\n&gt; we are sharing the same instance of Eclipse, or don&#39;t play well with<br/>\n&gt; the firewalls on our personal networks.  Has anyone tried a remote<br/>\n&gt; pair-programming solution that they were 100% happy with?
