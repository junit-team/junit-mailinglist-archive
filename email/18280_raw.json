Or are we really only interested in the result\n&gt; of the main method we&#39;re testing?\n\nI believe you should forget mocks for now and just write tests. Write \nfat, slow, brittle tests that, nonetheless, pass and drive your design \nincrementally. I did that when I first used JUnit and I can&#39;t imagine \ntrying to learn writing tests, driving design and using mocks all at the \nsame time!\n\nMy first real test suite had 175 tests and took 12 minutes to run, but \nit enabled me to do in 3 weeks what I&#39;d previously needed 3 months to \ndo. The fact that I could /now/ do it in 1 week with my vastly-improved \ntechnique was irrelevant then.\n\nGood luck.\n-- \nJ. B.
