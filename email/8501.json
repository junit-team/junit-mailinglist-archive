B. Rainsberger&quot; &lt;jbrains@r...&gt; <br/>\n&gt;wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; The whole point of JUnit is automate those tests so that you do not <br/>\n&gt;have to physically look at the result to verify it. You code what you <br/>\n&gt;expect in the test and the test runner tells you whether the results <br/>\n&gt;match your expectations. This is in perfect alignment with the <br/>\n&gt;purpose of JUnit.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;That is a good thing but there is more than one way to think about <br/>\n&gt;it. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>No argument against it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; There are many reasons to write tests this way. I suggest reading <br/>\n&gt;the available literature, especially Kent Beck&#39;s Test-Driven <br/>\n&gt;Development by Example, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.xprogramming.com\">http://www.xprogramming.com</a> and <br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.junit.org\">http://www.junit.org</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Thanks, maybe you should do some more reading too and listen to other <br/>\n&gt;developers to expand your perspective to include viewpoints other <br/>\n&gt;than your own.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve done it and moved on; there&#39;s no need for me to re-live it. I&#39;ve already gone through what you&#39;re going through, learned from it and got to where I am today. If that stops working for me, then I&#39;ll move on.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease don&#39;t assume that because my opinion is different from yours that that means that I don&#39;t completely understand your opinion. In this case, &quot;been there; done that.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; If JUnit wastes your time, <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;word twisting, never said that.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I believe you said that JUnit forces you to duplicate your tests. How is that not a waste of time? And what about my suggestion for dealing with that duplication? Did you decide it wouldn&#39;t help?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;If you think JUnit is beneficial, <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I do, and as I indicated I have plenty of experience with automated <br/>\n&gt;testing using xUnit.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;then you have to change your approach to work with JUnit. If you <br/>\n&gt;want to do something slightly different than JUnit, then you have to <br/>\n&gt;find that or build it yourself.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; I think those are your options.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;How about just hacking junit? Make it do something the designers <br/>\n&gt;never intended. That&#39;s another option.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>If you want to fork JUnit to a new project, no-one will stop you. I&#39;m not sure what the difference is between &quot;hacking JUnit&quot; and building something for yourself, though. No-one said you had to build from scratch.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you&#39;re interested in discussing the issues, that&#39;s fine. If you&#39;re going to allow yourself to be sidetracked by arguing about my motives, then please direct your energy elsewhere. I&#39;m not interested in discussing that.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nJ. B.
