Some of the other\n&gt; frameworks (utPLSQL, for example) already do this, but TextRunner\n&gt; seems to output next to nothing.\n&gt; \n&gt; Is there some setting or addon that we can use to have this\n&gt; information output as well? (Short of modifying the Assert class, of\n&gt; course.)\n&gt; \n&gt; (I know there is discussion about whether such output has value. The\n&gt; environment I&#39;m working in requires FDA-specified validation, and at\n&gt; least the values being compared have to be reviewed by a human being\n&gt; before a final approval signature can be applied. Therefore, a\n&gt; simple &quot;OK&quot; is insufficient to to pass review.)\n&gt; \n&gt; Thank you for your insight!\n\nYou need to change Assert to do what you&#39;re proposing with JUnit.\n\nAn alternative is to use Fit/FitNesse for this testing. In case you&#39;re \nnot familiar with it, Fit operates on test data in tables, so that you \nalways see input, expected output, surrounding prose and test results. \nThe results show actual output only when it differs from expected output.\n-- \nJ.
