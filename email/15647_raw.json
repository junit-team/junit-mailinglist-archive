I have heard this is good for testing.\n\nSo let me explain what I am trying to do. I am building my first web \nservices application but sticking with POJOs in the service layer \ninitially. I want to create a web service for a postcode lookup servlet \nwe already have. This servlet produces XML output but the code to \nconnect and send in paramters is all done manually (the author did not \nknow about web services at the time).\n\nSo here&#39;s my initial design.\n\npublic interface PostcodeService {\n    public String getAddressAsXML(String postcode);\n}\n\nnow, should I write a test class against the \ninterface(PostcodeServiceTest) or against the implementation \nclass(PostcodeServiceImplTest)?\n\nNow calling the underlying postcode servlet actually costs money so I \nknow I will need to produce a mock version of it also. So do I create a \ntest class for this also(PostcodeServiceMockImpl)?\n\nThats 3 potential test classes and also they will probably be very \nsimilar. Is that right? I can also see when I come to code DAOs i will \nbe in a similar situation since I will probably want to mock db access \n(perhaps the mock will return hard coded values).\n\nI am spending way too long thinking about this rather than writing code \nwhich has me a bit worried.\n\nAny input appreciated\n\nRP\n\nsaff@... wrote:\n\n&gt;Quoting Rakesh Patel &lt;rakesh.mailgroups@...&gt;:\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;However, the tests that result from TDD are NOT unti tests. They are \n&gt;&gt;actually quite high-level. I found dropping out of TDD into unit testing \n&gt;&gt;quite hard and unnatural. Even though the resulting tests are important \n&gt;&gt;to have, i couldn&#39;t help feeling that by not writing the lower-level \n&gt;&gt;unit tests (against say a private method) I was not doing the right thing.\n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Rakesh,\n&gt;\n&gt;It&#39;s really cool that you&#39;ve tried TDD and found it exciting.  I hope that you\n&gt;can quickly figure out something that feels like the right thing.\n&gt;\n&gt;Just to clarify, it sounds like you write a test for some functionality that\n&gt;feels high-level, and then find it fairly easy to quickly write the code that\n&gt;makes it pass, but at the end, find yourself with methods that appear to be\n&gt;tested only through tests exercising methods somewhere higher up the call\n&gt;chain, and you feel that it would be important to have tests against those\n&gt;lower-level methods.\n&gt;\n&gt;There are several situations that can drive me to have two &quot;levels&quot; of tests. \n&gt;However, I don&#39;t hit these situations on all projects:\n&gt;\n&gt;1) Running all the high-level tests takes longer than my attention span\n&gt;(somewhere around 30 seconds on good days, for me).\n&gt;2) It takes a long time to get each high-level test passing (I definitely get\n&gt;jumpy after an hour.)\n&gt;3) I can easily think of bugs in the lower-level methods that would not be\n&gt;caught by the higher-level tests.\n&gt;\n&gt;Notice that I might run into situation 1 after I had been working on a program\n&gt;for a while.  However, I try to catch situations 2 and 3 as soon as\n&gt;possible--they indicate that I need to adjust the &quot;pacing&quot; of my test-driven\n&gt;development toward more smaller tests.\n&gt;\n&gt;When I have two levels of tests, it is often the case that I actually have two\n&gt;failing tests at a time: one high-level failure, and one related low-level\n&gt;failure.\n&gt;\n&gt;I hope that helps.\n&gt;\n&gt;    David Saff\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt;Yahoo!
