I&#39;m interested <br/>\nin feedback regarding what others think is adequate. I am not <br/>\ninterested in why the question itself is incorrect, I know that. If <br/>\nyou were shown a project plan, told that unit tests weren&#39;t worked <br/>\ninto the schedule, but that they should be, and asked what percentage <br/>\nof time should be added - what would you say. Keep in mind the <br/>\npositive - management wants unit tests included and is willing to <br/>\nconsider allotting time.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome background:<br/>\nInitial requirements are complete. This is a major new version of an <br/>\nexisting product - new requirements, but not entirely new domain. The <br/>\nplanning is iterative, with medium-length development cycles that <br/>\nlook like small waterfalls.<br/>\n<br/>\nAny thoughts?</div>",
