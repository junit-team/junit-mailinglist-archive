Is it required that the debugger is validated? The compiler? The\n&gt; IDE? The OS? The JVM? Actually, the OS and the JVM are pretty\nimportant\n&gt; for the correct functioning of the software, as is the compiler.\n&gt;\n&gt; As I see it, unit tests are a development tool - they aren&#39;t (usually)\n&gt; shipped w/ the software. You could, in principle, write and use unit\n&gt; tests, but keep their sources and binaries in a separate place and\nnever\n&gt; even tell the auditors they exist, and the auditors would not know to\n&gt; miss them. I&#39;m not suggesting you do this, I&#39;m just a little confused\nas\n&gt; to why a development tool needs to be validated.\n&gt; Thenagain, if you want to use junit to validate your software\n&gt; formally, then I guess the validation tool itself needs to be\nvalidated?\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; -Antti-\n&gt;\n\n\nThey don&#39;t see any of our dev tools so they don&#39;t care about them being\nvalidated.  They want the test tools  validated since these are what\nthey use to validate the results of our use of the dev tools.   They\ntypically have strict rules about what versions of the JVM, OS, App\nServer, Database product, etc., can be used at run-time.  They don&#39;t\nvalidate the JVM or OS but do some kind of validation of the dev process\nof the products that run on them, e.g., they would have audited BEA if\nusing Weblogic.\n\nThe auditors want to see the evidence of unit, integration, and user\nacceptance testing.  So we could hide the tools used but when they saw\nautomated test evidence they could question the validation status of the\ntools used.  We also have to create various test plans (Master, Unit,\nUser, etc.) that document how the testing was planned.  The unit test\nplans I&#39;ve written state that we use xUnit, how the tests are organized\nand how to find the test source code since it is the definition of the\nunit tests done.\n\nI&#39;m not saying I agree with the need to validate junit since it is very\nlikely better tested than most software artifacts in existence.  \nHowever, if I could provide them with the things the QA folks and\nauditors are used to getting (requirements, traceability, test evidence)\nthen their reluctance to let us use junit would go away.  Last project I\ngot away with using junit by documenting a series of manual tests that\nparalleled the junit coded tests and showing the results were the same.\n\nSo what I need is:\n\n    * Something to serve as requirements for junit    * Something to\nserve as the design document for junit    * unit tests of the things in\nthe design doc (should be just the unit tests from a build)    *\nintegration/acceptance tests (could be my manual re-run of some of our\nproject specific unit tests plus the tests that come with a\ndistribution)    * Some way to describe the traceability from the\nrequirements to the design, requirements to acceptance tests.  Doesn&#39;t\nneed to be an actual matrix, could be just a description of the mapping.\n\nWith enough work I could create this but I&#39;m looking for help picking\nthe best artifacts and approaches to minimize my work and so that it\ndoesn&#39;t need to be redone with each release of junit.\n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n\n\n\n",
