I&#39;ve recomended it to people.\n \n&gt; See, this is just sad. First, I&#39;m not &quot;his buddy&quot;.\n\nNow you&#39;ve hurt my feelings :(\n\n&gt; Dave and I have exchanged the odd e-mail, but we hardly know each \n&gt; other.\n\nHoping to remedy that at soem point.\n\n&gt; I trust that Dave\n&gt; will tackle your problem in an upcoming Coad letter.\n\nPlanning to.  Probably the Feb. issue.\n\n&gt; I thought it was\n&gt; rude of you to insist he get off his ass and answer your question right\n&gt; now.\n\nYa.. it&#39;s not like I&#39;m starting a new contract, moving to D.C.,\nfinding an apartment, learning my way around, living in a hotel,\nwriting newsletters, finishing a book, or anything of that sort ;-)\n\n&gt; Be aware that we could be charging hundreds of dollars per\n&gt; day for our advice.\n\nAnd I, for one, do.\n\n&gt; We are volunteers here.\n\nYes, and it&#39;s very mutual.  I&#39;ve learned a lot on these lists, and try\nevery now & then to give something back.  Being blasted when I do\ndoesn&#39;t make it any easier.  It&#39;s a good thing I have a sense of humor\n(granted it&#39;s obtuse at times, and generally off-color).\n\n&gt; I hope that my other reply\n&gt; made it clearer what I think Dave was getting at: most people\n&gt; misunderstand (as I did for two years) why the class TestCase is \n&gt; meant to embody a test fixture. \n\nExactly\n\nDave\n\n\n",
