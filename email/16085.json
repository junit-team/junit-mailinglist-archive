What I want is to have things like a Description of<br/>\nthe test suite, which could be added to the JUnit test via something<br/>\nlike a metadata tag.  Then, when I run the tests and generate the<br/>\nresults into an XML file, it would add that description to the results<br/>\nfile.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIs this possible?  I would like to add a few more fields than that but<br/>\nit&#39;s one example.  I&#39;d also like to not have to create an<br/>\nimplementatin of TestCase since I already have existing tests and<br/>\ninstead would just like to be able to add the new information in some<br/>\nway, such as a metadata tag.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\nShay</div>",
