Specifically, it require us to implement a global counter for all tests, the counter record the number of failure, once it exceed this limit number, do something.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor example, we have Test case A, B; each has three tests. The whole test begin with Test A. Assume 2 tests of A failed, the counter is 2; then B begin, 1 test of B failed. Eventually the counter is 3. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut I did some experiments, seem like each test case will be running in a separate JVM process. It is quite tricky to share a counter between two process. <br/>\n<br/>\nI look through the API, maybe this requirement can be done with custom runner, though we do want change too much and continue to use Ant - Junit runner. <br/>\n<br/>\nPlease give me some hints on this issue. Thanks in advance.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nRegards.<br/>\n<br/>\nYang</div>",
