In fact from time to time I use the &quot;OO behavi=\r\nour&quot; Junit shows, by\nimplementing the Abstract Testcase pattern.\n\n&gt; I did n=\r\not want to &#39;derail&#39; the\n&gt; discussion from testing to making design changes =\r\nand thatz\n&gt; why I made it clear that &#39;letz not question the design&#39;.\n\nYes, =\r\nI understand that.\n\nBut, as I tried to say earlier, the &quot;inventors&quot; of Juni=\r\nt, and many of their\nusers, actually actively *use* writing tests as a desi=\r\ngn technique. So\n&quot;questioning the design&quot; actually doesn&#39;t sound like &quot;dera=\r\niling&quot; to me, but\nquite on topic. Your mileage may vary, of course.\n\n&gt; Also=\r\n someone was of the opinion that deep heirarchy could be\n&gt; a bad design..I =\r\nwanted to step-in and say &#39;of course not..it has it&#39;s\n&gt; own reason&#39;. \n\nI be=\r\nlieve you that you have your reasons. What I&#39;m not going to believe that\nea=\r\nsily is that the design really cannot possibly be improved by flattening\nth=\r\ne hierarchy - that simply too strongly contradicts my experience. It would\n=\r\nhave been interesting to discuss this specific instance, and I would have\ne=\r\nxpected to learn something from it. But I also understand and respect that\n=\r\nyou are not interested in such a discussion.\n\n&gt;&gt;  &gt; In real life, faulty or=\r\n imperfect designs are the norm.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;  Sure. That&#39;s one reason unit testi=\r\nng is so valuable: it makes some\n&gt;&gt; of the  imperfectionism more visible, s=\r\no that we can work on it.\n\n&gt; &#39;Faulty or imperfect design&#39;- well thatz not t=\r\nhe case when we\n&gt; can&#39;t use jUnit for this purpose.\n\nI don&#39;t understand wha=\r\nt you want to say here.\n\n&gt; Sometimes the app design might\n&gt; not provide int=\r\nerfaces to such a granular level that unit\n&gt; test might need.  It doesn&#39;t m=\r\nean the design is imperfect or\n&gt; sub-optimal. \n\nWith all due respect, in my=\r\n experience it very likely means exactly that, as\nit means that things are =\r\nrather strongly coupled. But perhaps we should\nsimply agree to disagree her=\r\ne...?\n\nNo hard feelings,\n\nIlja\n\n\n",
