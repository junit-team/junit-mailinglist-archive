IF you don&#39;t have \n&gt; &gt; side effects and\n&gt; &gt; IF you have decoupled code then I cannot see where \n&gt; &gt; dependencies between T(A)\n&gt; &gt; and T(B) make sense. A usually does not depend directly on B but on an\n&gt; &gt; abstract interface - B just being an implementation of that interface.\n&gt; \n&gt; I agree as long as A is not a subclass of B. If A and B are simply two\n&gt; different objects then I tend to test them in independent environments. If\nA\n&gt; simply needs to create object B because it gets information from that\nobject\n&gt; there are other ways to do this - plus that starts a slippery slope of\n&gt; munging unit tests with integration tests.\n&gt; \tHowever, if A is a subclass of B then I would like a quick way to say\n&gt; that if B fails then don&#39;t run those tests in A that require a working B,\nbut\n&gt; still run other tests against A that don&#39;t make direct calls to B. It\nwould\n&gt; simply make the error tracing a bit easier and avoid running tests that I\n&gt; know are going to fail.\n\nHave you run into this problem very regularly so far? And if you have, how\nbig was the effort to sort out the real problem? My guess is that going all\nthe way to define dependencies for every subclass relation is not worthwhile;\nat least not for me.\n\nJohannes\n\n-- \nCOMPUTERBILD 15/03: Premium-e-mail-Dienste im Test\n--------------------------------------------------\n1.
