Is there any functional difference between merging xml1-xml2 and merging xml1-xml3?  If there is not a functional difference, then I don&#39;t know that you need all the tests - you&#39;ve obviously already ruled out any merges that start with xml2.  If there is a functional difference (say the content of each xml object is in someway different), and you are testing the handling of those differences, then I would write a test for every variation that you are trying to handle.\n\nThat being said, you might be able to do it in a parameterized way, to save the effort of writing the permutations, but then I&#39;m not sure how you document what you are trying to test,...I&#39;ve never done the parameterized approach, but have heard it offered up a few times here.\n\nmy two cents,\ngood luck,\nDianne\n\n -------------- Original message ----------------------\nFrom: &quot;Harshal Shah&quot; &lt;shahharshal@...&gt;\n&gt; The question is more of implementation details but I was interested to know\n&gt; if there are API&#39;s or easy solution availables.\n&gt; \n&gt; Here&#39;s the problem:\n&gt; \n&gt; I have 3 xml files (xml1,xml2,xml3). I am testing the merging of these xml\n&gt; files. The following could be possible\n&gt; \n&gt; xml1-xml1\n&gt; xml1-xml2\n&gt; xml1-xml3\n&gt; xml3-xml1\n&gt; xml3-xml2\n&gt; xml3-xml3\n&gt; \n&gt; One method is to write testMethods for all these combination.\n&gt; One more approach is just write two for loops which will do this for\n&gt; me.Theproblem with this approach is the method is just single. Due to\n&gt; this, what\n&gt; is happening is the JUnit report just shows a single success or failure.\n&gt; \n&gt; I tried Anonymous Inner class approach but that did not work.\n&gt; \n&gt; Can somebody point me to some different approach to just have all the\n&gt; results displayed using just a single mehtod or some solution like this?\n&gt; \n&gt; -Thanks\n&gt; \n&gt; -- \n&gt; http://shahharshal.blogspot.com/\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt; \n\n\n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n",
