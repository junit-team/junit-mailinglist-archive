It was related to JUnitParams runner (<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://code.google.com/p/junitparams)\">http://code.google.com/p/junitparams)</a> which BTW. has been released today in the new version. <br/>\nNot only does JUnitParams solve the issue stated in the github comments you posted, but many others as well...
