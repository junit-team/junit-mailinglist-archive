However, I&#39;ve seen\n&gt; this as an excuse to completely ignore the exception,\n&gt; in both testing and production.  Don&#39;t like that at\n&gt; all.\n\nI agree, but at some point, you have to trust the people doing the work to do \nthe work. If they ignore exceptions both in tests and in production, then \nperhaps you need to replace them. :)\n\n&gt; So, I&#39;ve decided to knuckle down and NOT use\n&gt; unchecked exceptions whenever possible.  This *forces*\n&gt; you to handle them.  \n\nI don&#39;t like the patterns that checked exceptions compel me to use: converted \nexception, and so on... it all sounds like jumping through hoops just to \nsatisfy the compiler. My job is to make tests run, dammit, not to make the \ncompiler happy!\n\n&gt; That fact that you say using them allows the compiler\n&gt; to &#39;get in the way&#39; sounds like a non-issue.\n\n&quot;sounds like&quot;? With respect, do you *know* that it is a nonissue? (If so, how \ndo I make it go away?!) For me, it *is* an issue; otherwise, I wouldn&#39;t feel \nso strongly. \n\nI want to let exceptions propagate as much as possible, because exceptions \nrepresent situations where my code has to throw up its hands and say, &quot;Man, I \ncan&#39;t go any further.&quot; In most cases, that&#39;s unrecoverable within the layer \nand I want to propagate the exception up to the caller. In that case, checked \nexceptions couple the caller to callee unnecessarily at compile time. \n\nYes, the caller needs to be aware of and handle the exception; however, I&#39;m \nnot convinced that the compiler is the only way to achieve that. We&#39;ve \nmanaged quite nicely without the compiler&#39;s help and I&#39;m happy with the \nresults. Again: that&#39;s what tests are for and that&#39;s why code is written by \nhumans and not automatically generated.\n\n&gt; Is this\n&gt; coupling between your two systems?  Maybe...but I\n&gt; (personally) would rather have it and make damn sure\n&gt; those exceptions are handled.\n\nWhat fear are you addressing by using checked exceptions? Since it is \npossible to get along without them, you may be afraid of something in order \nto want to use them. What might that be? (Please help me; I sound like Ron.)\n\n--\nJ. B.
