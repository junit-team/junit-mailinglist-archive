The new\nsession beans are just pojos with dependency =\r\ninjection and the EJB\nstuff is merely visible as anotations.\n\nSo I guess I&#39;=\r\nm saying I don&#39;t feel that there is as much benefit of\nextracting the busin=\r\ness-logic of the session beans as pojos anymore\nsince the session-beans are=\r\n in effect pojos already (with\nannotations). And can be tested with regular=\r\n unit tests as they are,\nso why complicate things?\n\nOf course it&#39;s possible=\r\n that there are issues I have yet to run in to\nand that I&#39;m viewing this fr=\r\nom the sunny side but so far so good.\n\nWhat I would like to do though (I de=\r\nvelop in geronimo) is to be able\nto start up open-ejb inside some acceptanc=\r\ne-tests. It looked like it\ncould be done from open-ejbs site but I have not=\r\n gotten around to that\nyet. I still need to deploy to a server sometimes so=\r\n maybe the added\nbenefit of in-test containers are marginal or negative.\n\nI=\r\n&#39;m also interested in any issues people may have had with testing EJB\n3.0 s=\r\ntuff, it would be nice to know what to watch out for before I&#39;m\nin the midd=\r\nle of it :)\n\nJust my 2 cents...\n\n\nOn Jan 23, 2008 9:25 PM, Nat Pryce &lt;nat.p=\r\nryce@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; On 23/01/2008, Kent Larsson &lt;kent.lars=\r\nson@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;  |&gt; One approach I&#39;ve heard is to have the session bea=\r\nns as dumb forwarders\n&gt;  &gt; of requests to normal objects. And implement the=\r\n actual business logic\n&gt;  &gt; in normal Java classes.\n&gt;\n&gt;  This is how I do i=\r\nt and it works very well. It enforces a clear\n&gt;  separation between applica=\r\ntion logic, which is written as normal\n&gt;  object-oriented code, and the J2E=\r\nE technology. That keeps all the\n&gt;  awkward design issues of the J2EE frame=\r\nwork well outside the\n&gt;  application. The classes that refer to the J2EE fr=\r\namework are just an\n&gt;  adapter layer between the transaction management of =\r\nthe app container\n&gt;  and the objects of the application itself.\n&gt;\n&gt;  It mea=\r\nns that you can easily test the application code in plain JUnit\n&gt;  (and jMo=\r\nck).\n&gt;\n&gt;  You&#39;ll need end-to-end tests to ensure that the adapter layer wor=\r\nks as\n&gt;  expected.
