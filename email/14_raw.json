Are you just using &quot;TestSummarizer&quot; as the class name?  The JUnit\n&gt; GUI requires fully-qualified class names, e.g., &quot;summarizer.TestSummarizer&quot;.\n&gt; The classpath should then point one level up from the &quot;summarizer&quot; package\n&gt; directory.  (Should be fine as-is from JBuilder, though, I think; I&#39;ve not\n&gt; used JBuilder, though, so I&#39;m not sure.)\n\nYes! That was the problem. When I created the class, using the JBuilder&#39;s\nwizard, I had it create a package. When I ran from the IDE and specified\nsummarizer.TestSummarizer, it worked! (I also made a suite() method)\n\n\n&gt; If that&#39;s not it, I&#39;m pretty confused too!  Have you tried using the\n&gt; -classpath command line option instead of the environment variable?\n\nI was also able to get it to work from the command line by adding the\npath to the class with the &quot;-cp&quot; arg.\n\nThe package was the clincher.
