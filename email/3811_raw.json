However, \nyou still need to write the tests - it can&#39;t just &quot;test&quot; software \nwithout knowing anything about it.  And you may also find that your \nlegacy code is very hard to test.  This is because of design problems \nwith code that was not written with testing in mind - tight coupling \nbetween components, and interfaces that are hard to set up and use.  You \nmay have to make changes in your existing code to make it testable at all.\n\nTry writing some JUnit tests for your existing classes and find out just \nwhat your problems are.  And in the future, use JUnit as an integral \npart of your coding process, rather than something you do after the code \nis done!  You&#39;ll work faster and produce *much* better code.\n\n-- \n\nDavid Stagner\n\nNational Marrow Donor Program\n3001 Broadway Street NE\nBroadway Ridge Suite 500\nMinneapolis, MN  55413\n\nEmail: dstagner@...\n\n\n\n",
