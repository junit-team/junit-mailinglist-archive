Someone who uses Java needs to do it -- that wouldn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; be me. I could do it in Ruby, C#, or Smalltalk, none of which are very<br/>\n&gt; germane to this group. Something like this:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   Write a loop that times itself, using really short names. Duplicate it<br/>\n&gt;   with really long names. Time the loops. Repeat until you&#39;re sure you&#39;ve<br/>\n&gt;   got data. I&#39;d have them in the same program. It might be desirable to try<br/>\n&gt;   it with one of the loops first in the source, then the other, just in<br/>\n&gt;   case of garbage collection issues or things like that.

Our<br/>\nservers spent most of their time waiting for communications; they<br/>\nusually ran at a few percent of CPU.  Whenever they didn&#39;t, we replaced<br/>\nthem with faster servers.
