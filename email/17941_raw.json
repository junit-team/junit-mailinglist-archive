At many sites in the US of A, including my current\nand several previous ones, will often specify that users not be given\nadministration rights to their workstations and, further, that the\ndownload and install (in case you get around the lack of admin rights)\nof any unauthorised software (and they usually get picky down to the\nversion numbers) is a dismissible offence. This doesn&#39;t make sense,\napplied to developers, but corporate policies are a very real fact of\nlife for many of us. This is why many of us are not able to switch,\neven for non-production and develoment machines.\n\nSimon\n\n-- \nwww.simonpeter.org\n\n",
