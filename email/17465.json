A <br/>\nweb search reveals a couple other efforts to support unit testing, but <br/>\nit&#39;s tough to gauge how successful people have been with them.<br/>\n<br/>\nWere I doing J2ME development, I&#39;d find a way to unit (not integration) <br/>\ntest the bulk of the app irrespective of MIDP. I looked at a number of <br/>\nJ2ME examples. I have yet to come across one that isn&#39;t poorly designed <br/>\nand coded, with classes combining all sorts of concerns. UI + <br/>\ncommunications logic, command handling + parsing, game geometry/physics <br/>\n+ display logic, etc. All that parsing and math is easy to get wrong. <br/>\nIt&#39;s also very usable in other contexts if not married to the ME <br/>\nenvironment.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t see a reason why the majority of the classes in an ME app <br/>\ncouldn&#39;t be broken down and unit-tested, and I found a few links that <br/>\nsuggest some people are doing just that. Presumably, any MIDP-specific <br/>\nstuff--which should be a small portion of the app--would have to be <br/>\nmocked and integration tested (and probably manually, based off what <br/>\nyou&#39;re telling me).<br/>\n<br/>\nBut there&#39;d still be considerable benefit to unit testing the rest of <br/>\nthe app. That&#39;s conjecture; I&#39;d like to hear from a hardcore TDD <br/>\ndeveloper who&#39;s actually done this. It could be a mess and useless <br/>\nendeavor, which says more about the quality of the environment than the <br/>\nvalue of TDD.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve recently worked with customers using environments that don&#39;t <br/>\nsupport unit-testing very well. Working with a FoxPro developer, we were <br/>\nable to unit-test a good percentage (not all) of the code by <br/>\nrestructuring it a bit. What I found interesting is that a light almost <br/>\nimmediately went on in the Foxpro developer&#39;s head about the design <br/>\nbenefits of doing so.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf the environment doesn&#39;t support it, obviously you can&#39;t do complete <br/>\nunit-testing. One thing that is coming out of the interest in unit <br/>\ntesting is that the tool makers are figuring out how to design <br/>\nframeworks that more readily support testing (e.g. Spring), for better <br/>\nor worse.<br/>\n<br/>\nI seriously doubt that it&#39;d be necessary punt on an entire ME <br/>\napplication. And I suspect that any overhead related to how the <br/>\nenvironment had to be set up would be quickly paid off by the ability to <br/>\n&quot;close off&quot; large portions of the app.<br/>\n<br/>\nJeff<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nLangr Software Solutions<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://langrsoft.com\">http://langrsoft.com</a><br/>\nAgile Java: Crafting Code With Test-Driven Development</div>",
