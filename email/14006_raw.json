I want\n&gt; the developer of the test to state this. Maybe they could use a\n&gt; particular formatted comment, which I could parse and use to augment\n&gt; the results?\n&gt; \n&gt; The method I come up with I may have to impose on other groups within\n&gt; this project, so I don&#39;t want it to be heavy handed, if possible.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks for any suggestions,\n&gt; \n&gt; Nick\n&gt; \n&gt; -- \n&gt; Nick Piper, Developer, LogicaCMG           http://www.nickpiper.co.uk/\n&gt; GPG Encrypted mail welcome!                             1024D/3ED8B27F\n&gt; Choose life.
