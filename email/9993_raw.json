If I am running tests on the desktop\nI usually want to stop on the first failure, fix it and move on to the\nnext one.\n\nIf we are running a large set of automated tests for a build of an\nentire system that has code that spans multiple developers, it may be\npreferable to complete the entire test with a report of multiple errors\nthat the developers can scurry off with and recreate on their own, one\nerror at a time. On the other hand it some times works out better to run\nthe build tests and stop on the first error, with developers taking\nturns in the &#39;hot seat&#39; to fix their problem and start the build tests\nagain. \n\nIt really depends on which approach is most efficient for the team,\ngiven the application under test and the length of time it takes to run\nthe complete set of tests. \n\n-----------------------------\nMike Silverstein\nSilverMark, Inc.\nThe Object Testing Company\nwww.javatesting.com\n\n---\nOutgoing mail is certified Virus Free.\nChecked by AVG anti-virus system (http://www.grisoft.com).\nVersion: 6.0.541 / Virus Database: 335 - Release Date: 11/14/2003\n \n\n\n",
