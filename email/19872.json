If the method only has to be able to reverse one hard <br/>\ncoded string, we don&#39;t really need to pass in that string:<br/>\n<br/>\n    public String reverseTddSentence() {<br/>\n             return &quot;technology devolopment software a is Tdd&quot;;<br/>\n    }<br/>\n<br/>\nBut perhaps the real problem is that this is kind of a bogus <br/>\nrequirement? Where is it coming from?<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers, Ilja</div>",
