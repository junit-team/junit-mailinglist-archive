Make sure each line\nexecutes as you expect it to.  You can find many errors by following this\nsimple practice.&quot;\n\nI find his advice useful.  It is especially helpful in a debugger like VAJ\nas you can easily force code into error traps that are almost impossible to\ninduce during testing (like a database going down during a query, or the\nnetwork failing after you wrote to a socket, or a remote host failing after\nyou connected).\n\nDonald Holliday\n\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: Matthew Pope [mailto:mpope@...]\nSent: Thursday, November 15, 2001 2:58 PM\nTo: junit@yahoogroups.com\nSubject: Re: [junit] Anyone know of a decent debugger?\n\n\nFor the sake of discussing software engineering, I&#39;d like to point out that\nit\nis often less productive to use a debugger. Consider that using\norg.log4j.Category as a class var in your program, then: (assuming you have\na\nDebug class with a booleans SHALLOW, MEDIUM, DEEP )\n\nif( Debug.SHALLOW )\n    Log_.debug( &quot;got to just after xxx, someVar=&quot;+someVar )\n\nHere is a sample out put using Log_.info(..) in a debug run (actually a\njUnit\ntest case.)\n\n0 [main] INFO com.popetools.util.Debug  -\nutil.debug.static.OpenAppender(..):\nlog opened successfully.\n.370 [main] INFO com.popetools.unittest.PersistenceManagerExceptionTest  -\ntestCurrTransWhileClosed passed.\n\nThe first field indicates the millis that elapsed since the start of\nexecution, and the 3rd field indicates the class emitting the output, and\nthe\nrest of the line is the emitted information.\n\nAfter you&#39;ve debugged the code, you replace the SHALLOW with MEDIUM, or DEEP\nconsidering on the level of detail output it produces.\n\nThis way, the poor sod who makes a change to your code later, and needs to\ndebug it, already has the important debug state-check points indicated.\nHe/she simply has to replace the MEDIUM with SHALLOW, turn on Debug.SHALLOW,\nand presto, they can debug your code with minimal effort.\n\nIn the long haul, such schemes save time and effort.  Using a debugger\nshould\nbe the last thing you do to debug a module.  It takes a lot of time.\n\nRegards,\nMatthew\n\nCarolyn MacLeod/OTT/OTI wrote:\n\n&gt; Try Eclipse.\n&gt; http://www.eclipse.org/\n&gt;\n&gt; Carolyn\n&gt;\n&gt; Russ Baker &lt;rbaker@...&gt;\n&gt; 11/15/2001 03:10 PM\n&gt; Please respond to junit\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;         To:     &quot;&#39;junit@yahoogroups.com&#39;&quot; &lt;junit@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt;         cc:\n&gt;         Subject:        [junit] Anyone know of a decent debugger?\n&gt;\n&gt; Hello,\n&gt;\n&gt; I have been stuck using jBuilder to debug my code.  Well, after fighting\n&gt; with the IDE for months now, I have come to the conclusion that, for lack\n&gt; of\n&gt; better verbiage, jBuilder&#39;s (4.0) debugger is flaky.  The debugger\n&gt; constantly goes into code that it shouldn&#39;t, and actually forces me to go\n&gt; back to using the old System.out method of debugging, how wasteful!\n&gt;\n&gt; Does anyone know of a decent debugger?  I am currently using the jdk1.3.1.\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks in advance,\n&gt;\n&gt; Russ Baker\n&gt;\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
