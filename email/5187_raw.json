E.g. a method returning null when it is never supposed\nto do that generates a NullPointerException somewhere, and the appropriate\ntest does not reveal that fact by failing.\n Otherwise, I wouldn&#39;t test the PossibleImprobableRuntimeException, it will\nbe reported anyway.\n\n&gt; i wonder if writing exception tests in this way can sniff out &quot;smells&quot;\n&gt; that using a particular method might be too noisy?  that is, instead\n&gt; of throwing three different, possibly unrelated exceptions, maybe\n&gt; have the method declare one wrapping exception be thrown?\n&gt; \n\n The smell &quot;Missed an aspect to test&quot; ?\n\n",
