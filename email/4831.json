You never make typos and return the wrong variable<br/>\n&gt; in a getter, or set the wrong variable in a setter?

And i *cut and pasted* it from another setter-getter pair <br/>\nwith the same return type.<br/>\n<br/>\nA while later, i had to resort to printf() to debug some other, <br/>\nrelatively simple code that kept failing its unit test. Of course, it <br/>\nwas reading the wrong value out of the getter. Sure, it didn&#39;t take THAT <br/>\nlong to debug, but it certainly took an order of magnitude more time <br/>\nthan the minute or two it would have required to write and run a <br/>\nsetter-getter unit test. And it broke my rhythm, as last-resort <br/>\ndebugging is prone to do.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhich reminds me of another thing i&#39;ve found i like about JUnit... when <br/>\ni do printf() debugging now, i almost always do it in the unit tests <br/>\nrather than the code itself. With more complex classes, i sometimes <br/>\ndefine toString() to dump the object&#39;s internal state, so i can just <br/>\nprint out objects from JUnit tests. This is way better than the piles of <br/>\nprintf() statements that used to litter my code.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n<br/>\nDavid Stagner<br/>\n<br/>\nNational Marrow Donor Program<br/>\n3001 Broadway Street NE<br/>\nBroadway Ridge Suite 500<br/>\nMinneapolis, MN  55413<br/>\n<br/>\nEmail: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dstagner@...\">dstagner@...</a></div>",
