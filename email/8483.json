We have an AbstractTestCase and we just added<br/>\n&gt; &gt;the two version of #assertNotEquals there.

There is assertNull(); there is<br/>\nassertNotNull().  There is assertEquals(), there ought to be<br/>\nassertNotEquals().  Simple as that.<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, I know it can be worked around : assertFalse(a.equals(b));<br/>\nBut that&#39;s a wart.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd yes, I know that equals doesn&#39;t always work().  I spun my head<br/>\nover that one a few days ago (actually, equals() in this case did work<br/>\nbut I had come to the conclusion that it didn&#39;t - a long story I won&#39;t<br/>\ngo into here) - but if this is a serious problem, it&#39;s a problem<br/>\nwhether or not assertNotEquals() exists.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd while I could go out and get third party extensions, I prefer to<br/>\nstick with the published regular distribution, warts and all.<br/>\n<br/>\nI had always assumed that the JUnit developers had some strong reason<br/>\nfor overlooking such an obvious thing.  But maybe not.  If not, please<br/>\nconsider adding assertNotEquals for the next release.</div>",
