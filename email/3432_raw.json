There is , however, one behavior that I find troublesome.  This \nis the absence of a detailed stack trace when one runs only a single test \ncase (the second &quot;Run&quot; button).  Instead one only receives pass/fail \ninformation in the status bar (I&#39;m using the Swing UI).\n\nI often find myself in the case where one test of several has failed.  I \nmake the fix, and then want to test it again.  If I want detailed reporting \nI have to run the entire suite.  Some of my tests require time-consuming \nset-up operations, and when this is the case the overhead excessive.  Of \ncourse, at some point one needs run the complete suite, but when iterating \nbetween coding and testing it would be nice to have the full functionality \navailable for running a single test case.\n\nAnyone else have an opinion?\n\np.s. Forgive me if this issue has come up before, but I couldn&#39;t find it \nthe archives.  Also, one might argue that this is more of a development \nissue, but since it relates to the user interface, I&#39;ll go ahead and post \nit here.\n\n\n\nDavid Olivier\nNaval Research Laboratory\nDigital Mapping, Charting & Geodesy Analysis Program\nCode 7440.2\n\n\n",
