(How do I define a large project? If it goes wrong, then two VP&#39;s get very upset and tens of thousands of customers are affected ... that&#39;s large in my book.) We use JUnit for unit tests and to drive both functional and load tests (a little pragmatic automation in action! :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nHere are my thoughts on the pros and cons of using unit tests:<br/>\n<br/>\ncons:<br/>\n<br/>\n1. You actually have to write unit test code.<br/>\n2. You have to maintain unit test code.<br/>\n<br/>\npros:<br/>\n<br/>\nToo many to list here. Just spend about two minutes googling or surfing junit.org and you&#39;ll get a bunch.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think that if I could say only one thing about unit testing that people would remember, it would be this: &quot;Unit testing is the first toll booth on the road to software quality.&quot; (You may refer to this as Chappell&#39;s third law of Software Development). While I&#39;d be the first to say that there is more to software quality than unit testing, unit testing is the gateway to software quality. If you don&#39;t unit test, then it&#39;s either unlikely that you are doing the other requirements for software quality or you are trying to do them and they&#39;re failing because your basic building blocks (your testable units of software) are poorly written.<br/>\n<br/>\nI could write more, but that was the main point I wanted to make that wasn&#39;t already covered by the other excellent responses.<br/>\n<br/>\nSimon<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;-----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt;From: Kevin O&#39;Sullivan [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kosullivan@...\">kosullivan@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt;Sent: Tuesday, June 01, 2004 3:43 AM<br/>\n&gt;To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt;Subject: [junit] junit on large scale<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Hi - I&#39;m attempting to introduce junit testing techniques into <br/>\n&gt;where I work.<br/>\n&gt;So far I&#39;ve used it on a small scale, writing junit tests for <br/>\n&gt;enhancement<br/>\n&gt;changes to existing code.<br/>\n&gt;We have some large projects, along the lines of web booking engines for<br/>\n&gt;travel agents, that already exist. One of the concerns that I (and<br/>\n&gt;developers) have is that we will end up with thousands of test <br/>\n&gt;cases, many<br/>\n&gt;of which will involve using substantial amounts of MockObjects <br/>\n&gt;to set up<br/>\n&gt;test cases and that all this will become too much of an <br/>\n&gt;overhead to manage &<br/>\n&gt;maintain. Specifically,  that changing code in the future will involve<br/>\n&gt;analysis of not only the project code but also the junit test code - an<br/>\n&gt;overhead we don&#39;t have today of course.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Has anyone applied junit on a large scale such as this? I&#39;d <br/>\n&gt;love to hear<br/>\n&gt;comments about pros & cons and lessons learned etc.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Rgds,<br/>\n&gt;Kevin.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------ Yahoo!
