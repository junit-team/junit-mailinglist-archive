Sometimes if I have onlly one or two tests which don&#39;t\nneed it, they&#39;ll just ignore what setUp() did and recreate their own.\nI have one test suite where every test creates its own fixture \nbecause every one needs a different fixture.  That suite has an\nempty setUp(), but its tearDown still handles erasing the fixture and\ndoing any required cleanup since that doesn&#39;t change much.\n-- \nJoi Ellis                    Software Engineer\nAravox Technologies          joi@..., gyles19@...\n\nNo matter what we think of Linux versus FreeBSD, etc., the one thing I\nreally like about Linux is that it has Microsoft worried.
