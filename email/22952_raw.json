I prefer starting from what is _really_ needed, and then \n&gt; think about what is the best way to fulfill those concrete needs.\n\nSometimes to instant start working is good, but sometimes start thinking\nfirst is mutch better ;-) Try to make a &#39;big step&#39; can lead you make\nbecome to wallow.\n\nI prefer to start step-by-step (feature-by-feature) and if we have a\nsignificant count of features we should release it as next version. The\nremaining feature request are then the job for the version 3 of that\nspecification. I do not want the community to wait for 2 more years for\nrelease 2.0. So a combined workflow would be good.\n\nA good process can be to collect the ideas (for not more than 14 days).\nThen review and summarize it. And start a voting to collect what feature\nis most desired by the community.\n\nAfter voting we should define, how the xml should look like to handle\nthat feature. This can happen while you are creating the reference\nimplementation.\n\nWhen a feature is finished we should loop with the next &#39;most voted&#39;\nfeature.\n\nAre you agree?\n\nBest regards\nDaniela Waranie\n\n\n\n",
