That&#39;s a pain.\n\nHow do you know it&#39;s an infinite loop (as opposed to just a really long\none)? Do you know that a counter which should be decreasing is increasing\ninstead (or never going down)? Do you see a duplicate element come up in\nwhat should be a unique traversal? Is there something that is exposed\nwhich you can check to determine that the loop really won&#39;t terminate or\nsomething you could expose? There probably isn&#39;t much chance, but\nif you could, it might make your life easier.\n\nOn Sat, 20 Oct 2001, David Corbin wrote:\n\n&gt; I found a bug, so I want to write a test that exposes that bug.\n&gt;\n&gt; How does one write a unit test that exposes an infinte loop?  Well, writing\n&gt; one that exposes it isn&#39;t hard.  How do you expose it with out the test\n&gt; hanging?\n&gt;\n&gt; The only solution I can see is to use two threads, and set a maximum time\n&gt; for the test to run.  While I&#39;ve done it before, I really hate putting a\n&gt; time-limit specific tests, as every system behaves differently, and they\n&gt; behave differently at different times (it&#39;s that non-deterministic thing\n&gt; that I didn&#39;t understand in college :)\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks for any input....\n&gt;\n&gt; David Corbin\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
