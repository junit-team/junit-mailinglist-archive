Therefore, you cannot \n&gt; modify its\n&gt; state--but merely give it input and check its output.\n&gt; \n&gt; White Box is treating the object as a modifiable entity.  You have\n&gt; access to the internals of the object.  You may modify its state, or\n&gt; verify the internal state of the object is what is expected at all\n&gt; times.\n\nIsn&#39;t part of the difference that for black box testing, you don&#39;t know\nhow it works, just what it does, so you can only test based on interesting\ncase and boundary conditions on the inputs.  In white box testing, you\nknow how it works, so you can test based on knowing that different inputs\nget processing differently.\n\nFor example, for some index class, if you know it uses a linear list up\nto 5 items and then a hash table, choosing to test with 4 items to test\nthe list case and also test with 5 items to test the hash table case is\nwhite box testing.\n\n\n\nDaniel\n\n\n",
