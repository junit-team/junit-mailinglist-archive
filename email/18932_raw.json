That=\r\n first test is always\nvery expensive, especially if it&#39;s an area of your pr=\r\noduct that has no tests\nat all.  It all gets better after that.\n\nHope it he=\r\nlps, and looking forward to other people&#39;s answers.\n\n-- \nC=E9dric\nhttp://te=\r\nstng.org\n\n\nOn 2/16/07, felix3142 &lt;f.noz@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;   Hello,\n&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; we&#39;re going to establish unit-testing (basically for web applications)\n&gt;=\r\n in our company. Because we don&#39;t want to change the whole programming\n&gt; pa=\r\nradigm to XP we rather want to use a test-last method in the\n&gt; beginning an=\r\nd then watch out for further steps.\n&gt; I&#39;m now in the process of investigati=\r\nng the basic requirements and\n&gt; conditions.\n&gt; One question that occured is =\r\nif it&#39;s possible to quantify the amount\n&gt; of extra time you need when using=\r\n unit testing compared to the\n&gt; non-testing approach. I solely refer to the=\r\n writing of unit tests.\n&gt; Later saving of time (by better code) shouldn&#39;t b=\r\ne considered. So\n&gt; what&#39;s your experience? Can anybody do a statement about=\r\n time\n&gt; consumption of writing unit tests?\n&gt;\n&gt; Regards\n&gt; Felix\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\n\n[N=\r\non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n",
