    "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1468709764\">If the developers run all of the tests each time they check in (rather than<br/>\nwaiting for the nightly build), then they know immediately which tests they<br/>\nhave broken and which they are responsible for fixing.  If you have 100<br/>\ntests failing on a typical night, something needs to change about the<br/>\nprocess!<br/>\n<br/>\nOur current project has 1040 &quot;regular&quot; JUnit tests that run in about 10<br/>\nseconds.  So the developers run all of them all day long after everything<br/>\nthey do.  As soon as one of them breaks, we fix it right away.  There are<br/>\nanother 200 or so tests that take a little longer (some use Catcus on the<br/>\nserver side, some use database connections).  These run automatically when<br/>\nanyone checks in (kicked off by Cruise Control) , so within 10 minutes of<br/>\nsubmiting code to the repository, you know whether you have broken any of<br/>\nthese &quot;integration level&quot; tests.<br/>\n<br/>\nOnce the norm becomes all of the tests passing (rather than 100 failing),<br/>\nthe nature of your problem may change.  This is a much more scalable<br/>\napproach than trying to manage/distribute failure reports.<br/>\n<br/>\nJeff Nielsen<br/>\nDigital Focus<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &quot;yair fine&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:yair_fine@...\">yair_fine@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, August 06, 2003 5:12 PM<br/>\nSubject: [junit] handling test reports<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Hi ,<br/>\n&gt; I have a general question , and it is more of a design issue.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Currently , i am involved in a java project that has 3 people working on.<br/>\n&gt; We have somthing around 2000 junit tests running on a nightly build basis<br/>\n,using ANT.<br/>\n&gt; The nightly build proccess ends with a mail report that has the summery of<br/>\nthe tests<br/>\n&gt; reports , and has a link to a directory , where all tests reports are<br/>\nbundled.<br/>\n&gt; I mean , in the mail there is something like :<br/>\n&gt; 1900 tests succeed , 100 tests failed ..<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I also have a small util that can scan these reports and look for a<br/>\nspecific string ,<br/>\n&gt; like &quot;Page Fault occured&quot; , and add a reference to specific test report<br/>\nand line number.<br/>\n&gt; That way each developer of the 3 , can look at the mail summery , and<br/>\nsearch if there is<br/>\n&gt; any problem related to his part of the project.the summery is not too long<br/>\nor complicated<br/>\n&gt; to look in .<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; This strategy works fine in this quantity of tests and developers.<br/>\n&gt; What happens if I want to expand these nightly build tests 10 times more.<br/>\n&gt; Now , the project involves 30 developers , divided into sub teams.<br/>\n&gt; If i use the currnt format of reporting , i will get very big logs of<br/>\n,2000*10 =<br/>\n&gt; 20000,tests .And big mail summery that contain information that does not<br/>\ninterest every<br/>\n&gt; one.<br/>\n&gt; rpoblem 1:<br/>\n&gt; James , is in sub team A , and he wrote<br/>\ncom.company.pkg.testConcernsToJamesOnly<br/>\n&gt; and Rachel , is from team B , and she wrote<br/>\ncom.company.pkg.testRachelTests<br/>\n&gt; James don&#39;t want to see Rachels tests reports or mail summery , he don&#39;t<br/>\nwant to get lost<br/>\n&gt; in a big amount of data when he looks for his results.<br/>\n&gt; is there a way to split outputs , according to packages ?<br/>\n&gt; i.e, James&#39;s tests result will be sent to a differnt log file.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; problem 2:<br/>\n&gt; In a week , Rachel is going to be fired ( don&#39;t tell her that...)<br/>\n&gt; I want all reports and mail summery that rachel got , will be sent to her<br/>\nsuccessor.<br/>\n&gt; is there a way to create a connection between users and tests packages?<br/>\n&gt; i.e , now com.company.pkg.testRachelTests belong to George (the new guy<br/>\nreplacing Rachel)<br/>\n&gt; ,<br/>\n&gt; and for James too, for two weeks only,<br/>\n&gt; and com.company.pkg.testConcernsToJamesOnly still belongs to James<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I thought of maybe a configuration file that has notification list :<br/>\n&gt; _________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; James<br/>\n&gt; com.company.pkg.testConcernsToJamesOnly<br/>\n&gt; com.company.pkg.testRachelTests<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; George<br/>\n&gt; com.company.pkg.testRachelTests<br/>\n&gt; _________________________________________<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; but how do i implement this .<br/>\n&gt; does JUNIT / ANT support stuff like that?<br/>\n&gt; this is a real life issue<br/>\n&gt; regards<br/>\n&gt; Yair<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>",
