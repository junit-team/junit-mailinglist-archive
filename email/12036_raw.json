Some coverage is particularly sparse around UI code that \nwas written before the UI test framework was complete (abbot is used to \ntest used to test itself).\n\nCoverage is likely to mean very different things in different projects, \nso looking at a few different projects would best serve to help you \nunderstand how much it can differ, rather to find a common meaning.
