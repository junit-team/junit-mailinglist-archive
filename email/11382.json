It is more more<br/>\ninformative for the CanConnectToDatabase test to fail because of<br/>\nerrors, as subsequent tests (like RetrieveData, SaveData, etc) to fail<br/>\nbecause of an invalid assumption.<br/>\n<br/>\nI picture things like additional colours for assumptions and<br/>\ncorollaries (lets say orange) in the xUnit gui.<br/>\n<br/>\nandrew f<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Fri, 9 Jul 2004 11:26:47 -0400, David Plass &lt;dplass@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; How does adding &#39;assumptions&#39; and &#39;corollaries&#39; help?

We are not verifying Count<br/>\n&gt; in this test, but rather indexing.  Although I would argue that it is<br/>\n&gt; nice to have pre-requisites satisfied in the middle of a test, to help<br/>\n&gt; direct your attention to the true cause of the issue.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Much like the snowball effect of the nuclear reactor plant example.  A<br/>\n&gt; defect occurs, which in turn causes other defects (which in turn<br/>\n&gt; causes more defects, and so on).  From an analysis perspective it is<br/>\n&gt; difficult to pin-point the root defect because it is being masks but<br/>\n&gt; subsequent ones.  Unlike the above example, where the order of the<br/>\n&gt; defects can be used to unravel the issue, in testing order is<br/>\n&gt; independent, so the primary defects are not necessarily those that<br/>\n&gt; occur first.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; To address this, it would interesting to append two additional bits of<br/>\n&gt; information on an assertion.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 1) Assumption.AreEqual(3,list.Count,&quot;Check the count, and the add<br/>\nmethods&quot;);<br/>\n&gt; 2) Corollory.IsTrue(list.ContainsOnly(typeof(string)));<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; An assumption is really a pre-requisite - that if fails, really means<br/>\n&gt; that you were not even able to set-up to do the real testing.  Having<br/>\n&gt; assumptions fail helps to pin-point coupling between components - as<br/>\n&gt; well as helps direct your attention was secondary failing tests to the<br/>\n&gt; primary ones (aka the failed Assertions).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; An corollary is something you believe to be true, but is not essential<br/>\n&gt; to your unit test itself.  Corollaries are nice because you indirectly<br/>\n&gt; add additional tests for other components of our system without that<br/>\n&gt; much extra overhead.  Failing corollaries may highlight obscure bugs<br/>\n&gt; in other parts of your system, or they highlight your<br/>\n&gt; mis-understanding of those other parts (or they highlight a change to<br/>\n&gt; the underlying assumptions of those parts).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; On Thu, 8 Jul 2004 10:22:01 +0000, Jason Rogers<br/>\n&gt; &lt;jacaetevha@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; On Wednesday 07 July 2004 10:49 pm, Curt Sampson wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  On Tue, 6 Jul 2004, hedgi wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  &gt;   Now I there is the problem.

I&#39;m stuck<br/>\nwith<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  &gt;   it.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  I&#39;ve been thinking for a while that this is a serious problem in<br/>\nJUnit<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  (and most unit testing frameworks), because it&#39;s been such an<br/>\nannoyance<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  for so many people. Let&#39;s face it; a lot of groups of tests do have<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  known dependencies between tests such that if test A fails, we know<br/>\n&gt; that<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  the output of tests B, C and D are uninteresting. Yet we end up<br/>\nrunning<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  B, C and D anyway, and then searching through all the error output<br/>\nfor<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  the failure that we know is the &quot;real&quot; one, ignoring all the others<br/>\nas<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  spurious.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; With all due respect, I believe that is a code smell.  It seems to say<br/>\nto<br/>\n&gt; me<br/>\n&gt; &gt; that there is something not right about the design of the code being<br/>\n&gt; tested,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; or perhaps even more elusive, something is wrong with how the tests are<br/>\n&gt; &gt; written.  When I find these types of dependencies I inevitably rethink<br/>\nhow<br/>\n&gt; I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; have written my tests.  Have I coded in the dependencies or are they<br/>\n&gt; really<br/>\n&gt; &gt; there.  More times than not I have coded in the dependencies -- and<br/>\n&gt; therefore<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I can remove them.  Further, I would argue that I _NEED_ to remove them.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Now, maybe I am old-fashioned but I believe tests (at least at the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; unit/programmer level) ought to be as autonomous as possible.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; --<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Jason Rogers<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 117 N.
