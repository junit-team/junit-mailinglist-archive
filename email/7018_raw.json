At worst you would have some duplication of effort and at best\nyou would have someone who would catch test cases the developer didn&#39;t. Same\ncould be said of pair programming, and that seems to work for some people.\n\nI don&#39;t see any conflict either, whether it is done as part of a pair\nprogramming effort or as a totally independent effort. Where do you see the\nconflict?\n\nNow, if you also have another person writing unit tests at the same time the\ncode is being developed, then you get the benefit of a second pair of\nindependent and fresh unbiased eyes. After all, we have code walkthroughs\nand peer reviews right? If every developer could see the errors in their\ncode and develop tests to exclude them, then what is the purpose of those\npractices? Such practices are just another form of testing.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; I do sometimes worry though that my testcode doesn&#39;t test the boundary\ncases too well since it is\n&gt; not my dedicated job to make the code break.  But, with TDD my code is\n90-100% tested whereas\n&gt; therwise it would be 10% (if that).  That is such a marked improvement\nthat I think it is well worth it,\n&gt; even without independent testing.\n\nI am not arguing against TDD, or arguing that independent unit testing\nwould/should replace TDD - far from it. I am saying that independent unit\ntesting has its own value and serves as another very important early filter\nfor bugs in code and designs. Again, the earlier you find a bug, the better,\nand it is well worth the extra effort - unless the effort doesn&#39;t find bugs,\nwhich I seriously doubt.\n\nFWIW,\nLauren\n\n=====\nLooking for an experienced Java/C++ Software Engineer?\nSee: http://developerdude.mystarband.net/resume.html\n\n\n",
