Essentially, the model has a<br/>\nlistener infrastructure and if the user changes the value of the class<br/>\nattribute the appropriate event is supposed to fire.  The typical<br/>\nsetter/getter looks like this:<br/>\n<br/>\nclass MyBean extends Listenable {<br/>\n    String value;<br/>\n<br/>\n    public String getValue() {<br/>\n        return value;<br/>\n    }<br/>\n<br/>\n    public void setValue(String newValue) {<br/>\n        fireAttributeChangedEvent(&quot;value&quot;, value, newValue);<br/>\n        value = newValue;<br/>\n    }<br/>\n}<br/>\n<br/>\nI need to test that the setters fire the appropriate event, and that the<br/>\nevent attribute name is correct.  I want a test harness to essentially<br/>\ncollect all the setters and getters and change the value to ensure that<br/>\nthe event is sent as expected.  Then I want to run that against all my<br/>\ndomain models.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy understanding is that I need to generate a suite, and add the test<br/>\ninstances to that suite.  I&#39;ve upgraded to JUnit 4 because I think it is<br/>\ndesigned better.  I&#39;m just at a loss as to how to start.  With JUnit 4,<br/>\nindividual tests are marked with an annotation.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",
