The wonderful thing about systems like this is that\nthe different parts can be made to know just about nothing about the other\nsystem components. All the client knows is that it talks to a queue. There\nis no rule that the queue talks to a server.\n\n1) Create a queue stub which is implemented in the simplest way possible\n(e.g. it contains a List or Vector). In your testcases, trigger the client\nto send a request into the queue. Verify that the client produces a\nvalid and correct message. Repeat for all messages.\n\n2) Do the same with the server. Programatically insert requests into the\nqueue (one at a time) and make sure the correct response ends up in the\noutgoing queue. Repeat for all requests.\n\n3) Add some tests to #1 and #2 where your stub queue throws appropriate\nexceptions. Simply create a stub which, e.g. always throws a IOException\nwhen something is enqueued and use that in a test.\n\n4) Now test the real queue without the client and server code.\nProgramatically insert a message into the queue and make sure it is\nreceived at the other end. You can open sockets for both ends of the\nqueue in your testcase or whatever. You can also perhaps stub out the\nSocket instance and just make sure the queue uses it correctly.\n\n5) Now that you know that all of the codepaths in individual units have\nbeen tested, you can approach integration testing, but it just becomes an\nexercise to make sure that your well-tested units work together.\n\nOn Fri, 16 Nov 2001 jie.mei@... wrote:\n\n&gt; Hi Jim,\n&gt;\n&gt; you are right about testing the unit but not the flow. But how do you unit\n&gt; test an eventdriven, asynchronous JMS client?\n&gt; In my case, a client sends a message to a queue, then executes other tasks\n&gt; but listens for the arriving of the answer. The server sends back its\n&gt; answer into another queue. When the message arrives, the message listener\n&gt; activates a certain client method in which then the answer is executed\n&gt; upon.\n&gt; How can I test such a scenario with JUnit? All I can imagine is writing\n&gt; some &quot;meta&quot; methods for the client which return a value on invoking. In\n&gt; this method, the sending, listening and receiving of the method are\n&gt; gathered together. Can anybody help with another solution?\n&gt;\n&gt; I would appreciate any help.\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt; Jie\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Bitte antworten an junit@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;\n&gt; An:     junit@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Kopie:   (Blindkopie: Jie Mei/mummert/de)\n&gt; Thema:  RE: [junit] Inner Class, Even Driven Classes\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; At 06:44 AM 16/11/01, you wrote:\n&gt; &gt;Hi\n&gt; &gt;Thanks for the detailed reply.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Can you help me out on the second question .. How do I write test cases\n&gt; for\n&gt; &gt;event driven program ?\n&gt; &gt;For e.g. I have a class A.\n&gt; &gt;This has three functions\n&gt; &gt;1. public boolean ConnectURL();\n&gt; &gt;This function connects to a particular URL and loads the details onto the\n&gt; &gt;screen. If this is successful, it returns true else false.\n&gt; &gt;2. public void Initialisation();\n&gt; &gt;This functions initializes some parameters\n&gt; &gt;3. public boolean Save(Object obj);\n&gt; &gt;This function saves the details on the screen and if successful, it\n&gt; returns\n&gt; &gt;true, else false.\n&gt;\n&gt; Yuk! Horrible naming - the customary naming convention is for lowercase\n&gt; method names. (There&#39;s a pdf on sun&#39;s customary coding conventions - you\n&gt; can download it from Sun).\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;  In my test class, I will be writing test methods for all these\n&gt; functions.\n&gt; &gt;1. Do I need to write a test method for the second function that is just\n&gt; &gt;doing some initialization. If so, how will I write that ?\n&gt;\n&gt; You should definitely test the initialisation - assuming it actually does\n&gt; something &quot;interesting&quot;. You might find that you need to add some get/set\n&gt; methods to do so, though.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;2. For the first function, I will write a test method as follows\n&gt; &gt;public boolean testConnectURl() {\n&gt; &gt;         A obj1;\n&gt; &gt;         boolean  b = obj1.ConnectURL();\n&gt; &gt;         /// How do I write an assert statement after this ?\n&gt; &gt;}\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; assertTrue(&quot;Connection failed?&quot;, b);\n&gt;\n&gt; or\n&gt;\n&gt; URL myURL = objl.getURL();\n&gt; // connect, test content a la httpunit.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;I have seen the archive of all the messages but I am not clear on how I\n&gt; &gt;write test classes for event driven programs.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; The same as any other way. Don&#39;t forget that unit testing is not about\n&gt; testing program flow - it&#39;s about testing how a class works at a &quot;unit&quot;\n&gt; level. This is (often) taken to mean testing methods/functions.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; --\n&gt;\n&gt;                            *   Jim Cheesman   *\n&gt;              Trabajo:\n&gt; jchees@... - (34)(91) 724 9200 x 2360\n&gt;               Exaggeration is not\n&gt; all it&#39;s cracked up to be.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
