B.,\n&gt; \n&gt; You&#39;re quite welcome.\n&gt; \n&gt; Sometimes you just have to look at the code and listen\n&gt; to what it&#39;s trying to say (to mix my metaphors).\n&gt; \n&gt; It certainly wasn&#39;t due to VAJ knowledge on my part. \n&gt; The closest (very tongue-in-cheek) I&#39;ve ever come to\n&gt; VAJ was a few peeks at the the Smalltalk VA back in my\n&gt; ParcPlace Systems days where it was a key competitor.\n&gt; \n&gt; Rick\n&gt; \n&gt; --- &quot;J.

Sometimes we can&#39;t see the forest for the\n&gt; &gt; trees. Since I haven&#39;t used VAJ since early 2001, I\n&gt; &gt; would never have made the connection.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Take care.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; J. B.
