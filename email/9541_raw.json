The development environment is wonderful,\n&gt; &gt; the code is much easier to debug, the language itself is clear and\n&gt; &gt; almost entirely free of the weirdnesses that characterize Perl.  But\n&gt; &gt; it&#39;s slow.\n\n&gt; there are around several java vs c/c++ benchmarks from different sources.\n\nI&#39;m sure that there are.\n\n&gt; The typical result is that latest jdk (1.4) are 30%-100% slower than\n&gt; c/c++ code.\n\n100% slower?  You mean, I assume, that when you run C++ the Java is too\nembarassed to run at all?\n\n&gt; It depends a lot on the code run, the jvm impl (ibm vs sun, ecc.) and on\n&gt; the c/c++ compiler (MS vs gcc, ecc.), what I report is just a &quot;mean&quot; value.\n&gt;\n&gt; These are commonly accepted results. To say that java (1.4) is 30 times\n&gt; slower is simply false (was true for old jdk).\n\nI do believe that what I said was that on the particular test that I was\nrunning, Perl (_Perl_, not Java (1.4 or whatever)) was 30 times slower.\n\nWhether this was &quot;commonly accepted&quot; is irrelevant.  What matters is\nwhat happens when you run the tests.\n\n--\nJim Dixon  jdd@...   tel +44 117 982 0786  mobile +44 797 373 7881\n\n\n",
