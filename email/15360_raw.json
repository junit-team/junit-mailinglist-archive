Since some people see benefit in thinking about frameworks\n&gt; similar to JUnit in terms of behavior, and not testing, perhaps there is\n&gt; a benefit in cognitive flexibility to leaving the annotation @Before\n&gt; instead of @BeforeTest.  @BeforeTest is somewhat &quot;hardcoding the\n&gt; metaphor&quot;.  However, since I&#39;m still contrigued about behavior-driven\n&gt; development, this is just a whimsical thought.\n\nI liked @Before and @BeforeClass. I&#39;m not sure why I suggested \n@BeforeTest and @BeforeSuite. It&#39;s that dinosaur thing again.\n\n&gt; But it&#39;s really just using summaryString as a testing utility.  I&#39;d be\n&gt; tempted to write this instead, which feels clearer:\n&gt; \n&gt; assertThat(states, summarizeTo(&quot;GREEN 0.0 GREEN 0.5 RED 1.0&quot;))\n\nThe problem with this is that you lose the context of the &quot;states&quot; \nobject in the method &quot;summarizeTo&quot;. Generalizing this looks bad, as it \nresorts to the kind of reflection you showed next:\n\n&gt; Constraint summarizeTo(String summary) {\n&gt;     return applyTo(eq(summary), callMethod(&quot;summaryString&quot;));\n&gt; }\n\ncallMethod on which object? Bang, you&#39;re dead. :)\n\nI&#39;ve thought about the difference between:\n\n     assertEquals(expected, states.summary());\n\nand\n\n     assertTrue(states.summaryEquals(expected));\n\nThey&#39;re the same, except that the summary() method has a higher chance \nof being useful in contexts other than testing, whereas summaryEquals() \nstands no such chance. As a result, I choose the former.\n\nSo...\n\n     assertThat(states.summary(), eq(new Summary(0, 0.5, 1));\n\nwould be my choice.\n-- \nJ. B.
