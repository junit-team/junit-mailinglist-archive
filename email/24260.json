If anyone knows a way to get their attention beyond<br/>\nrepeated requests through normal support channels, I&#39;d be all ears.<br/>\n<br/>\n   David Saff<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Fri, Jan 25, 2013 at 3:49 PM, Teemu Kanstr�n &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:tkanstren@...\">tkanstren@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; **<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I don&#39;t quite see how this would work. Take Eclipse as an example: it<br/>\n&gt; &gt; chooses which test classes it wants to run with no help from the<br/>\n&gt; org.junit<br/>\n&gt; &gt; source code (by looking at its own internal model of the classpath), and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; then eventually asks JUnit to run them. By the time any code I could add<br/>\n&gt; &gt; to JUnit would take effect, it would already be too late.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; OK, so I guess it would be up to the IDE developers to support the category<br/>\n&gt; selection in the GUI.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Something that would help me is if there was a way to define a suite by<br/>\n&gt; package name. So I could say @Suite(package=&quot;foo&quot;) and the suite would then<br/>\n&gt; consist of all tests in package &quot;foo&quot; and its &quot;subpackages&quot; (such as<br/>\n&gt; foo.bar). Is this possible somehow?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I generally just like to group my tests by packages but the current syntax<br/>\n&gt; seems to require me to manually keep a list of classes for each suite. If I<br/>\n&gt; add or remove any test classes, I would need to update the suite. IntelliJ<br/>\n&gt; allows me to right-click on a package and run all tests in it like this.<br/>\n&gt; But then it just runs all my tests and I don&#39;t have control over categories<br/>\n&gt; etc. With a package level suite definition I could configure it in a<br/>\n&gt; separate class as I like and not worry about updating it for new tests etc.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Also, junit.org has been showing a 404 page for a few days at least. Is<br/>\n&gt; that by intent? Was looking for some documentation on this.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Teemu<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed] </span></blockquote></div>",
