I=\r\nf I\nsounded patronizing that way, I appologize - that wasn&#39;t my intent.\n\n&gt; =\r\nIn real life, faulty or imperfect designs are the norm.\n\nSure. That&#39;s one r=\r\neason unit testing is so valuable: it makes some of the\nimperfectionism mor=\r\ne visible, so that we can work on it.\n\n&gt; If a framework forces you to chang=\r\ne your design to be useful,\n&gt; you can bet that most companies will keep the=\r\nir design and\n&gt; choose another framework.\n\nAnd some developers would rather=\r\n choose a framework that is lightweight than\none that better supports scena=\r\nrios they don&#39;t strive for anyway.
