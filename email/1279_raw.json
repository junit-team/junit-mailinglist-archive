What are we trying to do when we do &quot;unit&quot; testing?\n&gt;A. We are testing all of the interfaces exposed by a &quot;unit&quot; to external\n&gt;components to ensure that those interfaces react as we would expect them to\n&gt;in all reasonable scenarios that we can think of.\n&gt;\n&gt;So to answer the question about private/protected methods: Does a private\n&gt;method expose itself to external components? No - therefore we do not need\n&gt;to test them. Errors within private methods will become apparent from\n&gt;testing the other interfaces.\n\n\nUndoubtably that&#39;s true. But then if we are accepting that testing \npublic/friendly/protected methods adecuately test these methods, why not go \none step beyond and say that black box testing is all we need? It seems to \nme that testing private methods is as useful and valid as testing \nnon-private ones, just at a different level of granularity.\n\n\n\n&lt;snip&gt;\n\n\nJim\n\n\n--\n\n                           *   Jim Cheesman   *\n             Trabajo: \njchees@... - (34)(91) 724 9200 x 2360\n         On one hand, I&#39;m \nindecisive, but on the other, I&#39;m not.\n\n\n\n",
