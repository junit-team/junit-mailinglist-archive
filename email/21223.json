If somebody<br/>\nwants to contribute it would still be possible to use the maillist or<br/>\nget in direct contact with a developer.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Does anyone know for sure if there&#39;s a hosting solution that scores 100% on<br/>\n&gt; Worldwide Access?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t know any but I would look for a european hosted one. That way you<br/>\nshould be able to get around US-specific export restrictions.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Does anyone know what the restrictions involve? (I<br/>\n&gt; wonder if it&#39;s something to do with SSL connections from countries to which,<br/>\n&gt; theoretically, you can&#39;t export SSL-enabling technology, or couldn&#39;t at one<br/>\n&gt; point--I&#39;m very rusty on this).<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;d have to check the SSL-handshake with sourceforge but I assume that<br/>\nthe server is not offering weak cryptography for establishing a SSL-<br/>\nconnection. Not the SSL-technology as such is restricted but the<br/>\n&quot;strongness&quot;. You&#39;re only allowed to export/use weak cryptography<br/>\nlike RSA-keys with AFAIR 368 bits or symmetric keys with AFAIR 40 bits.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not sure if these numbers changed in these days (the last time<br/>\nI was interested in that was 10 years ago), but if you allow a server<br/>\nto do these kind of &quot;secure&quot; connections nowerdays you might give<br/>\nother users using a wrong version of a browser a wrong sense of<br/>\nsecurity, so many server only allow unrestricted cryptography<br/>\nfor the establishment of SSL-connections.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; It appears that if we allow browsing the documentation and downloading<br/>\n&gt; through junit.org, and other services through Google Code, we&#39;d be offering<br/>\n&gt; the same level of worldwide access we are now. Is that true?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>The browsing of the source at sourceforge is possible without SSL,<br/>\nso it would be a step back.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nRegards, Lothar</div>",
