There&#39;s no doc, but <br/>\nthere are unit tests and a copy of our XP2000 paper.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe code includes our expectation library and mock implementations of <br/>\nthings like io, servlets, and jdbc. There&#39;s also a jar that provides <br/>\nsome fill-in classes so it can run in Java 1.1.x. Given it&#39;s raw <br/>\nstate, please be gentle with us ;-) <br/>\n<br/>\nInterestingly, one of the morals of this exercise is the importance <br/>\nof the IDE. Creating mock objects from an interface is actually quite <br/>\neasy if you&#39;ve got a tool, such as VisualAge or NetBeans, that will <br/>\nwrite the skeleton.<br/>\n<br/>\nSteve<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In junit@y..., &quot;Dinwiddie, George&quot; &lt;George.Dinwiddie@a...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; Speaking of mock objects, I needed to test some objects that <br/>\ninitialized<br/>\n&gt; themselves from a JDBC ResultSet.  Rather than generate a test <br/>\ntable and<br/>\n&gt; stuff data into it, I decided to create a MockResultSet.  Well, <br/>\nResultSet is<br/>\n&gt; an interface with a LOT of methods.  What a boring chore this <br/>\nturned out to<br/>\n&gt; be.  In the end, I created an AbstractMockResultSet class that <br/>\nthrows an<br/>\n&gt; SQLException for every method.  If anyone needs such a thing, let <br/>\nme know<br/>\n&gt; and it could save you a lot of typing. </span></blockquote></div>",
