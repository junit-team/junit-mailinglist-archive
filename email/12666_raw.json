We&#39;ve been thinking of using XSLT on the\nTESTS-TestSuites.xml files which our nighly build today saves in date\nstamped report folders. But we&#39;re fairly new to XSLT and slow at getting it\nright. \n\nWe&#39;d like to support the best we can to get something smart here.\n\nMorten\n\n\n&gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; From: didoss@...

Before generating new report,\n&gt; why not you\n&gt;       take copy of the previous report.  In Ant API  contains copy tag\n&gt; and move\n&gt;       tag. So\n&gt;       first step you take a back up using Copy/ Move tag.\n&gt;       Second step you clear your old report using delete tag.\n&gt;       Third step create report folder again.\n&gt;       Finally you generate new report.\n&gt; \n&gt; Are you saying there&#39;s no extension for JUnit that sends the test\n&gt; results/report into a database, using JDBC or some other mechanism?  I&#39;m\n&gt; new to JUnit, too, but I find it hard to believe that there isn&#39;t\n&gt; already software to store historical test results in a database.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Todd.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Yahoo!
