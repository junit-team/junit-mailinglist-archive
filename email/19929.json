Since frameworks should be as small as possible, <br/>\n </span></blockquote>it <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; makes sense to include only those features we are certain should <br/>\n </span></blockquote>be there.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is true what you say, any way concerning the open-clossed <br/>\nprinciple the framework (every framework try to acomplish it) should <br/>\nbe closed for modification, but open for extension, as you know for <br/>\nsure (also The selfish class article is a good recipe for makeing <br/>\ngood frameworks). <br/>\n<br/>\nI guess jUnit modifies the class loader mechanism. It allows the <br/>\nuser to change the start (setup() method) and the end of the process <br/>\n(teardown() method). Such are the open points on the process. If the <br/>\nclass loader mechanism (something that happen at the begining) is <br/>\nmodified, why not to let the user to configurate the classpath, <br/>\nbecause such modification shouldn&#39;t affect the intention of the test.<br/>\n<br/>\nA advanced user could expect, following the open-close principle, to <br/>\nallow the user at the begining (open point) to change the classpath <br/>\nthat could affect the whole process of a given testing method.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is my mental process about this problem, that respect the idea <br/>\nabout what is framework.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe use of Ant invites to people to go to other framework, for doing <br/>\nsomething, that could provide a framework allowing advanced users to <br/>\nmodify the class loader mechanism via open-clossed principle in <br/>\norder to modify the classpath.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks any way for your opinion, it make me think and reflect about <br/>\nall this.<br/>\n<br/>\nDavid</div>",
