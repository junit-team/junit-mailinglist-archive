You are absolutely right that if we had frequent releases the optimal strategy would be to conceal everything possible in the framework and open it up &quot;on demand&quot;. I don&#39;t see how to implement frequent releases with JUnit, however, since the IDE vendors bake JUnit into their offerings and we don&#39;t have any infrastructure to push updates. Perhaps I am just fussing about this, or there is a simple solution. I am open to suggestions.\n&gt; \n\nMost developers will not need to extend JUnit at all, no matter how many \nor which hooks you provide. If one does need an extra extension point \nthat you decide is a good idea, then you can add it and make a release. \nThe developers who need it can  fairly easily install it in their IDE or \nother framework.  As long as you don&#39;t actively change the published API \nor remove any pieces of it, the IDE should continue to work. So I \nwouldn&#39;t worry excessively about leaving something out.\n\n-- \n﻿Elliotte Rusty Harold  elharo@...\nXML in a Nutshell 3rd Edition Just Published!\nhttp://www.cafeconleche.org/books/xian3/\nhttp://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0596007647/cafeaulaitA/ref=nosim\n\n",
