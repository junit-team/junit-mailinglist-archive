If you annotate a test, then it is beforeClass and afterClass.<br/>\nAnd finally,<br/>\nif you annotate a method, then you are listening before/after that test<br/>\nclass.<br/>\n<br/>\nRegards,<br/>\nBogdan<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a>, Alistair Israel &lt;aisrael@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hi, David, Malte.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; May I barge in?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m seeing myself, and others needing what could be called &#39;lifecycle&#39;<br/>\n&gt; event listeners/hooks in JUnit:<br/>\n&gt;  - JUnit startup/shutdown<br/>\n&gt;  - before/after suite<br/>\n&gt;  - before/after class<br/>\n&gt;  - before/after method<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; We have the last two, but not the others.
