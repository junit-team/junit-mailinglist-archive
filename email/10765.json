What am I <br/>\n&gt; missing?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Sounds like you need to read up on references...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;The simple version is that &quot;ABC&quot; may be living at slot A in memory.  You<br/>\n&gt;then set your variable newLoginId to equal that, which is to say that<br/>\n&gt;there is some slot in memory (let&#39;s call it B) that now points to A.<br/>\n&gt;Then you set your dupLoginId variable that lives at slot C in memory and<br/>\n&gt;tell it to point to slot B, which is pointing to slot A which is &quot;ABC&quot;.<br/>\n&gt;Yes, strings are immutable, but that means nothing in this case.  You<br/>\n&gt;have 2 references to the same object in memory.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yes, but if that object is guaranteed never to change (which is true of <br/>\nStrings), what is the harm? This is the type of aliasing that is considered <br/>\nbeneficial, as it reduces memory usage.<br/>\n<br/>\nActually by the above model I believe that the dupLoginId points to A not B <br/>\nas &quot;value&quot; of a reference is the memory it points to and = copies <br/>\nvalues.  To check, run the following code:<br/>\n<br/>\nString a = &quot;abc&quot;;<br/>\nString b = a;<br/>\na = &quot;cde&quot;;<br/>\nSystem.out.println(b);<br/>\n<br/>\nIt will print &quot;abc&quot;.  (At least it did when I tried it out in bsh).<br/>\n<br/>\n(Also see Item 4 of Effective Java).<br/>\n<br/>\n-Kathy Van Stone<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kvs@...\">kvs@...</a></div>",
