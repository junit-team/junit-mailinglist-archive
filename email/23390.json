These <br/>\ntests are still executed and the result is inverted (a test error is <br/>\nreported as success because it is what is expected whereas a success is <br/>\nreported as error to indicate that the feature has been implemented). <br/>\nThe @NotYetImplemented tests appear with the suffix &quot;(NYI)&quot; in the <br/>\nreports but aren&#39;t counted differently.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve proposed for some time to add such a feature in JUnit but the <br/>\nencountered enthusiasm was quite limited ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers,<br/>\nMarc<br/>\n-- <br/>\nHtmlUnit support & consulting from the source<br/>\nBlog: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://mguillem.wordpress.com\">http://mguillem.wordpress.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nLe 14/04/2011 21:26, lars.vonk a écrit :<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; Hi,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I would like to see progress in (acceptance) tests not yet implemented. I want these reported differently than normal failures. Is there a way in JUnit to distinct between expected failing tests and &quot;normal&quot; failing tests?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; So in a report I would like to see something like:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Tests: 42<br/>\n&gt; Failures:0<br/>\n&gt; Errors: 0<br/>\n&gt; Ignored: 0<br/>\n&gt; To implement: 12<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Regards, Lars </span></blockquote></div>",
