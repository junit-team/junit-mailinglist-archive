Remember that TDD is a<br/>\n&gt; /design/ activity, not a testing activity.  I am afraid that generated<br/>\n&gt; assertions would break the basic cycle feedback of TDD.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I am not going to tell you not to do this project, but calling it TDD<br/>\n&gt; would cause me to call into question your understanding of TDD.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; chet<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Agreed, essentially Jim, what you are describing (to me at least) is<br/>\nautomating the unit testing of code.  It does not sound like TDD.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd there&#39;s nothing wrong with that - JUnit is a tool that makes no<br/>\nassumptions on what design process we use.<br/>\n<br/>\nIndeed, there are already several tools out there that can<br/>\nautogenerate JUnit tests for code, and still others that &#39;play&#39; with<br/>\nthe byte code to see if your unit tests are actually any good at<br/>\ntesting.  However, none of these tools are aimed at TDD, they are<br/>\naimed at Unit Testing.<br/>\n<br/>\nhth<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck with the course<br/>\n<br/>\nAndrew</div>",
