If the method doesn&#39;t say &quot;test&quot; before it, it will not be  \nincluded in the test suite automatically.  So, I would recommend you  \nwrite your utility methods; they can call assert just like any other  \ntest.  Suppose calling delete twice violates your contract, writing  \nthat test becomes pretty simple with these utility methods.\n\npublic void testMultipleDeletes {\n\tcreate();\n\tget();\n\tdelete();\n\ttry {\n\t\tdelete();\n\t\tfail();\n      } catch (Exception e /* should be more specific, of course */) {\n}\n\nOnly the methods that start with &quot;test&quot; are tests.\n\n-shane\n\nOn Monday, June 30, 2003, at 11:29  AM, Leonardo Abreu de Barros wrote:\n\n&gt; Hi all,\n&gt;\n&gt; I have a simple question about arranging related tests inside a test\n&gt; case:\n&gt;\n&gt; - Let`s say I have three tests that in some way depend on each other:\n&gt; for example, a creation, a getter and a deletion method.\n&gt; These are distinct functionalities, and thus deserve to be on\n&gt; separate tests. The problem is: if one fails, the other two will run\n&gt; anyway. But if the creation or getter methods fail, it doesn`t make\n&gt; sense for me to test the deletion method, as it depends on the\n&gt; correctness of the other two. I know calling one test inside another\n&gt; is not recommended. What should I do in this case?\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------ Yahoo!
