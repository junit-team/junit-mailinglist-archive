It doesn&#39;t. To Java, files are byte sequences, nothing more.\n\n... and thus it should be the responsibility of the Java \nimplementation to make files behave that way, yes?\n\n&gt; &gt; The program says &quot;read [or write] the next K bytes down this\n&gt; &gt; stream&quot;. If &quot;this stream&quot; happened to be connected to a record-\n&gt; &gt; oriented file, Java should do exactly what the program says -\n&gt; &gt; which is to invoke the filing-system call appropriate to writing\n&gt; &gt; to that file, I would have thought, not just splattering the\n&gt; &gt; bytes randomly into the file&#39;s blocks.\n&gt;\n&gt; Nothing&#39;s random. \n\nThat&#39;s a matter of philosophical debate; but here I meant only\nthat where the data gets written is not well-correlated with the\nunderlying file structure.\n\n&gt; Any notion of\n&gt; record boundary is in the application logic, not the Java library.\n\nSuch a notion may be in the filing system. \n\n&gt; &gt; [Which is why Jena&#39;s RDF/XML writer uses line.separator at a\n&gt; &gt;  critical point; we had been generating RDF/XML that some\n&gt; &gt;  application running on Windows Did Not Like. Having the user\n&gt; &gt;  change it to a Modern Application wasn&#39;t an option.]\n&gt;\n&gt; You may not realize it, but this risks creating malformed XML when your\n&gt; library is used on certain IBM platforms.\n\nIf you can be specific about the issue, then we can be specific\nabout fixing the code. (Since most of the other linebreaks are\ngenerated by `println`s, that same problem may or may not arise\nelsewhere in the writer.)\n\n-- \nChris &quot;electric hedgehog&quot; Dollin\nThe software engineer&#39;s song: &quot;who knows where the time goes&quot;.\n\n\n",
