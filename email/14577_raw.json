My point (which came out wrong) was that if the class was\nwritten test-first then I wouldn&#39;t feel like I needed to use a coverage\ntool to be sure it&#39;s covered.  But for those projects that aren&#39;t\nwritten that way it helps to know what isn&#39;t getting covered with the\ntests (unfortunately it doesn&#39;t say too much about how well everything\nelse *is* covered).\n \nIf I did discover that a private method wasn&#39;t being covered in some\narea I would first look to see how to call the public API to cover those\ncases.  Failing that, I would figure out how to remove the code that&#39;s\nnot covered.  If calling the code via the public API doesn&#39;t cover it,\nthen it isn&#39;t serving any purpose.  If the reason I want to make a\nmethod public is because it&#39;s harder for the test to call the public API\nin that case, then I do some redesign to remove the difficulty.\n \n..David..\n\n________________________________\n\nFrom: junit@yahoogroups.com [mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com] On Behalf Of\nJim Cakalic\nSent: Thursday, September 01, 2005 12:44 PM\nTo: junit@yahoogroups.com\nSubject: [junit] Re: How to test private methods in a class.\n\n\nDavid Jackman wrote:\n&gt; Actually, if you were really following TDD then you wouldn&#39;t have\n&gt; the private method unless it was already covered by tests.  At\n&gt; least that&#39;s the methodology I use (no change happens to my code\n&gt; until there&#39;s a failing test forcing the change, except for\n&gt; refactoring).  So the code coverage tool shouldn&#39;t be (as)\n&gt; necessary.  I&#39;ve found I only use them for those project where\n&gt; (someone else :) wrote the code without writing tests first.\n&gt; In that case, it helps to know the coverage, but also can give\n&gt; me a false sense of security.\n&gt;  \n\nDavid,\n\nThis is the way I practice TDD as well -- test first. I&#39;ve been\nlearning that not everyone is as disciplined as we are. Code coverage\ntools /can/ be a two-edged sword. I use it as an audit check for how\nwell I&#39;m adhering to TDD. Sometimes I can still slip and this helps me\nidentify my own backsliding ways early so I can correct the problem by\nadding the right tests. But you are correct, just because the code is\nbeing executed by a test does not mean that it is adequately tested.\n\nMy recommendation was that a coverage tool be used to provide\nconfidence that private methods are being executed by existing tests\nthrough the public API. The impluse that leads to making the private\nmethod public for testing might diminish if one could be shown that\nthere was no need. Do you think it would be preferable in that context\nto measure code coverage before making methods public?\n\nRegards,\nJim \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________________________\n\nYAHOO!
