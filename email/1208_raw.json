He invokes the\n&gt; &gt; TestRunner in the main method of the class. Is this standard or\n&gt; something\n&gt; &gt; we&#39;re doing wrong.\n&gt;\n&gt; As I understand it, JUnit inspects your test class to get its list of\n&gt; methods, and its default constructor.  It then instantiates one copy\n&gt; of the test class for each test method and stores that in a vector of\n&gt; tests.\n&gt;\n&gt; So yes, JUnit will initialize the test class and then run setup()\n&gt; for every individual test method on the class.  This is how it keeps\n&gt; the fixture clean for each test.  (The code which does this is in\n&gt; the junit.framework.TestSuite contructor and\n&gt; junit.framework.TestSuite.addTestMethod().\n&gt;\n&gt; If you have initialization which must execute at most once for the\n&gt; entire set of methods, see the junit.extensions.TestSetup class.\n&gt; That&#39;s what I use, anyway.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; --\n&gt; Joi Ellis                    Software Engineer\n&gt; Aravox Technologies          joi@..., gyles19@...\n&gt;\n&gt; No matter what we think of Linux versus FreeBSD, etc., the one thing I\n&gt; really like about Linux is that it has Microsoft worried.  Anything\n&gt; that kicks a monopoly in the pants has got to be good for something.\n&gt;            - Chris Johnson\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
