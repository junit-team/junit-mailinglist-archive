For a better defense of ET and discussion of the \n&gt; &gt; limitation of automation than I could ever provide, you should read \n&gt; &gt; some of Cem Kaner&#39;s articles on http://www.kaner.com/. Note that I \n&gt; &gt; don&#39;t agree with a lot of it.\n&gt; \n&gt; Can we see the list of things you don&#39;t like, too?\n&gt; \n\nTo clarify my sentence above, the last word &quot;it&quot; equates to things\nwritten on the site about exploratory testing, as well as a lot of\nnegatives about test automation. I already mentioned what I don&#39;t like\nabout ET in my previous append and this group/XP/agile people can\narticulate the advantages of automation better than I. If you want to\ndig, Mr. Kaner and I went back and forth a bit in on this subject in\nJanuary of this year on the software-testing group. Of course there&#39;s\nalways more to be said but not enough time. Anyway, to reiterate a\ndifferent append of mine, if you want to have a good/fun/heated\nconversation on these subjects with peple who have very strong, well\nearned opinions you should take this subject to the sodtware-testing\ngroup.\n\n---\nOutgoing mail is certified Virus Free.\nChecked by AVG anti-virus system (http://www.grisoft.com).\nVersion: 6.0.510 / Virus Database: 307 - Release Date: 8/14/2003\n \n\n\n",
