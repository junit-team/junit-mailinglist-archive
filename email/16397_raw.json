I do have his book, but\nit&#39;s at work and I&#39;m =\r\nat home right now.\n\nAnyway, to a certain extent, JUnit doesn&#39;t actually car=\r\ne how the\nmethod that it calls does it&#39;s job. If you are testing\nLibrary.re=\r\ncursiveMethod() and it returns a result, then just test the\nresult. If ther=\r\ne are some standard &quot;easy&quot; results then start by\ngetting those to work righ=\r\nt.\n\nA more concrete example perhaps: Take the factorial calculation. The\nin=\r\nput values of zero and one give known, defined, values. So when\nwriting a v=\r\nersion of factorial, I&#39;d start with those and ensure that\nthey worked befor=\r\ne progressing on to the calculated values.\n\nassertEquals(0, Factorial.calcu=\r\nlate(0));\n\nand\n\nassertEquals(1, Factorial.calculate(1));\n\nThen, when those =\r\ntests pass, move onto the input values that you know\nwill force recursive c=\r\nalculations.\n\nUsing JUnit isn&#39;t only about testing assertions, although tha=\r\nt&#39;s\nwonderful enough, it&#39;s also about guiding you to think about testing\nyo=\r\nur code and making it provably correct before/during/after you write\nit.\n\nJ=\r\nUnit could care less about how you implement your method, but *you*\nneed to=\r\n care plenty about whether it&#39;s testable.\n\nSimon\n\n--\nwww.simonpeter.org\n\n",
