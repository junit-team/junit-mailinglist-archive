However, an ABORTED test might be a surprise to the user: the<br/>\ntest assumes that it is connected to the network, and that assumption<br/>\nfailed.<br/>\n<br/>\nSplitting out these states might allow tools depending on the test<br/>\nruns to take different actions based on the different results.  For<br/>\nexample, ABORTED tests might be treated similarly to IGNORED tests<br/>\nduring development, but would prevent check-in or deployment.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis raises three very different questions:<br/>\n(1) Should we have these 4 states, or stick with our current 3?<br/>\n(2) If we choose to have 4 states, what&#39;s the best name for the new state?<br/>\n(3) Are assumption failures, by default, to be treated as IGNORED, or ABORTED?<br/>\n<br/>\nIt might be good to get these decisions made, and move on.<br/>\n<br/>\n   David Saff<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Sun, Sep 18, 2011 at 8:10 PM, Stefan Birkner &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mail@...\">mail@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; Currently the Result class simply ignores testAssumptionFailure.

It&#39;s because Result doesn&#39;t provide any information, that a test is ignored because of a failing assumption.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Any objections?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Yahoo!
