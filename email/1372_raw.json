My management is\n&gt; also very unhappy about the concept of using freeware to to do\n&gt; stuff that&#39;s\n&gt; mission critical.  They want to see proof that tools work, that they&#39;re\n&gt; reliable and supported.   The use of Open Source/freeware for commercial\n&gt; purposes represents a shift in mindset because it doesn&#39;t the pattern of\n&gt; normal procurement processes:  &quot;Okay so we&#39;ve got the source code, we can\n&gt; fix bugs ourselves if anything goes wrong: doesn&#39;t that mean we&#39;ve just\n&gt; lumbered ourselves with a whole bunch *of someone else&#39;s code* to\n&gt; maintain?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; You might think businesses would say &quot;Hey, it&#39;s free!  We&#39;ve\n&gt; saved a bundle\n&gt; of cash!&quot; but what they actually say is &quot;If it&#39;s any good why are they\n&gt; giving it away?&quot;.\n&gt;\n&gt; This is why Apache isn&#39;t on 100% of web servers.\n&gt;\n&gt; APC\n&gt;\n&gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; From: Blum, Robert [mailto:rblum@...]\n&gt; Sent: 01 June 2001 16:45\n&gt; To: &#39;junit@yahoogroups.com&#39;\n&gt; Subject: RE: [junit] Research on the success of JUnit on projects\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Yes, JUnit was a success for us. No drawbacks - except the fact that the\n&gt; friggin machine finds your mistakes :-)\n&gt;\n&gt; But let me ask you a question - do you really seriously have to justify\n&gt; _writing test cases_ ?\n&gt;\n&gt; If not, what&#39;s keeping you from using it?\n&gt;\n&gt; Bye,\n&gt;   Robert\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; &gt; From: wegfn06@...

I want my\n&gt; &gt; company to start using it, but in order to sell the idea I would like\n&gt; &gt; to be able to call on success/failure stories of the use of JUnit on\n&gt; &gt; projects.  If you have the time, I would appreciate any stories of\n&gt; &gt; how JUnit was used successfully on your project, where there any\n&gt; &gt; disadvantages of using JUnit, do you think it improved your\n&gt; &gt; productivity etc?  I would like to quote companies, but I appreciate\n&gt; &gt; that you may think this is sensitive material, so I think the best I\n&gt; &gt; can hope for is to see if the majority of responses liked using JUnit\n&gt; &gt; or not.  Either way, thank you in advance for your help.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Regards\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Mik Q\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; &gt; junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Your use of Yahoo!
