I am trying what you sug=\r\ngest, and it appears to be working...but not working as intended.  It is st=\r\nill running all of the tests.\n\nI am doing:\n\nResult r =3D (new JUnitCore()).=\r\nrun(Request.method(Class.forName(&quot;my.package.CalculatorTest&quot;), &quot;testAdd&quot;));=\r\n\n\nAnd it&#39;s acting like I&#39;m just doing:\n\nResult r =3D (new JUnitCore()).run(=\r\nClass.forName(&quot;my.package.CalculatorTest&quot;));\n\nin that it&#39;s still running ev=\r\nery test in my.package.CalculatorTest.  From what you said and what I&#39;ve re=\r\nad in the javadoc, this should be working...but either I&#39;m doing something =\r\nwrong or it&#39;s not working.  Can anyone confirm that using run(Request) actu=\r\nally works?  Thanks again.\n\nBTW, I&#39;m using JUnit 4.5\n\nFrom: junit@yahoogrou=\r\nps.com [mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com] On Behalf Of David Saff\nSent: Thursda=\r\ny, October 16, 2008 10:38 AM\nTo: junit@yahoogroups.com\nSubject: Re: [junit]=\r\n How to run individual test case within a test class from command line(JUni=\r\nt 4.x)\n\n\nnom_ah,\n\nThis should work (I haven&#39;t compiled it):\n\nnew JUnitCore.=\r\nrun(Request.method(class, methodName));\n\nLet me know.\n\nDavid Saff\n\nOn Wed, =\r\nOct 15, 2008 at 1:44 PM, nom_ah &lt;rhuff@...&lt;mailto:rhuff%40slicked=\r\nit.com&gt;&gt; wrote:\n&gt; I am wondering if it is possible to run an individual tes=\r\nt case from a\n&gt; test class from the command line using JUnitCore?
