You are right that with &quot;keep junit running&quot;<br/>\n&gt; option in debug mode &quot;Run&quot; action does not fail, but it<br/>\n&gt; does not execute the test either. I&#39;ve added tracing to the<br/>\n&gt; test method and it is just not being called.

For me, it works (and runs the code!) when <br/>\nrerunning individual test method instances /that were found using <br/>\nthe standard TestSuite(TestCase) constructor/.  But for dynamically <br/>\ngenerated test cases, it doesn&#39;t rerun them.  Looks like an Eclipse <br/>\nbug to me.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n(For lurkers:  The Eclipse &quot;Keep JUnit running after a test run when <br/>\ndebugging&quot; option is on the run configuration screen.
