I&#39;m trying to understand what actually happens with NUnit. I mark a<br/>\n&gt; test as &quot;slow&quot;, and run all of the tests in my project. Are you saying that<br/>\n&gt; without selecting the category of tests to run, the IDE doesn&#39;t run the<br/>\n&gt; slow tests, that is it only runs tests which are not marked as slow? If<br/>\n&gt; this is so, how does it know which are the slow tests?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\nIn NUnit, I can mark a test as slow by annotating it [Category(&quot;Slow&quot;)].<br/>\nNUnit<br/>\nhas no idea what &quot;Slow&quot; means or what to do with it. It&#39;s just a tag. In<br/>\norder<br/>\nto make use of the category I have to either specify it using a command-line<br/>\noption or select it in the Categories window of the NUnit Gui. In either<br/>\ncase,<br/>\nI can choose to run all tests or just some categories. I can also choose to<br/>\nexclude some categories. There&#39;s actually more flexibility at the command<br/>\nline than in the Gui, since I can specify boolean combinations of categories<br/>\nthere like &quot;Data-Slow&quot;, which means run all the Data category except those<br/>\nalso marked as Slow.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere are differences in the implementations, as I have observed them. It may<br/>\nnot be complete and could even be dead wrong in the case of JUnit, so please<br/>\ncorrect me if I&#39;m off base:<br/>\n<br/>\n1. NUnit categories are strings. JUnit&#39;s are classes.<br/>\n2. NUnit controls what categories to execute at runtime, without changing<br/>\nthe code.<br/>\nJUnit requires changing the code or at least setting up suites for each of<br/>\nyour commonly<br/>\nused categories in advance. I suppose some IDEs may allow runtime selection<br/>\nof categories for JUnit.<br/>\n<br/>\nThese two differences appear to be orthogonal.<br/>\n<br/>\nRegarding the first difference: I once spent some time considering emulating<br/>\nJUnit and using a Type rather than a string to represent a category. Use of<br/>\na<br/>\nType (class) is more sophisticated and appealed to me at first. In the end,<br/>\nI<br/>\ncouldn&#39;t really point to an solid advantage to the user, so we still use<br/>\nstrings.<br/>\n<br/>\nRegarding the second difference: Runtime category selection is something<br/>\nNUnit users wouldn&#39;t want to do without these days. There seems to be no<br/>\nobstacle to allowing it in JUnit while retaining the ability to define<br/>\nsuites as now.<br/>\nThat&#39;s what I would do...<br/>\n<br/>\nCharlie<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed] </span></blockquote></div>",
