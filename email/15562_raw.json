I go to the database where the URLs are stored and then open a\n&gt; URL connection and ping the service.\n&gt; \n&gt; I iterate through the URLs, and collect the results. I want to be able\n&gt; to display a message for all the URLs that fail. But I cannot see how\n&gt; to do that.\n&gt; \n&gt; This test only does on thing, so I don&#39;t think this is a case where I\n&gt; need to break up the test. Also I don&#39;t want to have to be aware of\n&gt; what URLs fail before hand by checking specific URLs with assertEquals.\n&gt; \n&gt; Is there a way I can display multiple errors or failures, in Junit?\n&gt; I have read the FAQ about the logic for not being able to display\n&gt; multiple results, but I don&#39;t feel like the argument is applicable here.\n&gt; \n&gt; If there is a previous response, please fowared the message id, when\n&gt; searched I kept getting &#39;search timed out, only partial results&#39;.\n\nI believe that if you search with Google, you&#39;ll find a lot of results. \nTry keywords &quot;junit multiple assertion failures&quot;.\n\nThe short answer: there is a way to make JUnit do this, but many of us \ndon&#39;t like to do it that way. For a test like this, I might do the \nfollowing:\n\nList failedUrls = new ArrayList();\nforeach (URL url : urlsToTest) {\n     if (failed(url)) {\n         failedUrls.add(url);\n     }\n}\nassertTrue(failedUrls.isEmpty());\n-- \nJ.
