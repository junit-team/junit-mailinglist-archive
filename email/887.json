If your tests are dependent<br/>\non certain other tests being run before them, then you need to package<br/>\nthem into a single test.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt sounds like you can&#39;t run the later ones if the earlier ones fail,<br/>\nanyway.  I&#39;d but them all in a method named testSomething and use the<br/>\nString parameter to the assert() call to tell you which test failed<br/>\nand why.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you really want them to be independent, use the setUp and tearDown<br/>\nmethods to provide the necessary environment.<br/>\n<br/>\n - George<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Boris Boehlen [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:boris@...\">boris@...</a>-aachen.de]<br/>\n\t[snip]<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Simply rename your test methods so they don&#39;t start with *test* word, this<br/>\n&gt; will prevent them to be executed by TestRunner.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This is a possible solution I found too. IMHO this is not very useful in <br/>\nmy case, because I still like to know which tests succeeded and which<br/>\ndidn&#39;t.<br/>\nUnfortunately this does only work if you have written &quot;testXXX&quot; methods<br/>\nbecause<br/>\nJUnit invokes these methods independantly. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Dependent actions should be written within one test case. There was<br/>\n&gt; a discussion on this mailing list few weeks ago (look for the thread<br/>\n </span></blockquote>[junit]<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Order of Tests).<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I found these discussions and do not agree. In my application area the <br/>\nresult is that I have several mini test case which depend heavily on<br/>\neach other. The glue between them would be a number of test cases which <br/>\nmust themselves be used in larger test suites (can I nest test suites,<br/>\nbtw?).<br/>\n<br/>\nRegards<br/>\n\tBoris Boehlen</div>",
