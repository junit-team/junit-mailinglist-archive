Does not make a big difference\n&gt; to download 2 or 3 files, IMHO.\n\nActually, on my latest project, I&#39;ve just been using the matchers in\njunit-4.4.jar, and it&#39;s been going great.  So at least this user is\ndoing fine with one jar.  :-)\n\nDo you yourself need hamcrest-library for what you&#39;re doing?\n\n&gt; - the classpath problems would not manifest themselves if the hamcrest-core dependency was missing,\n&gt; or in any case it would be easy to spot fail-fast problems, as opposed to really nasty problems due\n&gt; to different versions of hamcrest-core, one embedded and one not, in the classpath.\n\nIt is easy to spot fail-fast problems, but not necessarily easy to fix\nthem--we have at least one user a month who posts to the user list\nconfused about how to get just the single junit.jar on their\nclasspath.\n\nI&#39;m saying that both are problems, and any solution is a trade-off.\nMy personal hunch is that if you ask Java developers the first jar\nthey ever put on their classpath, JUnit scores high, and I&#39;m very\nconcerned about making that experience any more complicated than\nnecessary.\n\nOn the other hand, so much of the complexity here is unnecessary.  I\nbelieve that a vanilla Java installation should include a jpkg command\nline, so that the answer to the first JUnit FAQ could be:\n\njpkg install junit\n\nIt would be great if end-users didn&#39;t have to care how many jar files\nwere installed to make that work, or even what a jar file is.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; - by bundling hamcrest-core you are also surrendering the advantage of a clear versioned dependency\n&gt;     structure, which is extremely important with so many open-source libraries, all interconnected\n&gt; among them.  A lot of people nowadays use maven or maven-like repositories for their project\n&gt; dependencies.\n\nI&#39;d love to see more people use maven (it&#39;s the closest thing to the\nmythical jpkg we have), so making life hard for them is not good.\nHowever, I think that there&#39;s still more people who are downloading\nthe jar manually from the website, and still more who just use\nwhatever ships with their IDE, so balance is important.\n\n&gt; Ideally, I would like to see junit released with all its constituent libraries - mandatory or\n&gt; optional - separate.  And perhaps have a junit-all that bundles all of the them, including\n&gt; hamcrest-library, as a utility packaging for those that choose to use it.  Other users may choose\n&gt; not to.\n&gt;\n&gt; Alternately, I would be grateful if junit could also release the unbundled jar - call it junit-dep\n&gt; or whatever, which requires the external dependency to be present in the classpath.\n\nI think that the second is the right solution.  Look for further news\nsoon.  Thanks,\n\n   David\n\n",
