The javascript functions would \nignore the default - hardcoded - action of the form, unlike pure httpUnit.\n\nThe buttons were :\n      &quot;Save&quot;, &quot;Delete&quot;, &quot;Reload&quot;...\nThe javascript functions were :\n      &quot;callSaveServlet()&quot;, &quot;callDeleteServlet()&quot;, ..\nThe target servlets were :\n      SaveServlet, DeleteServlet, ReloadServlet\n\n\nUsing Velocity (http://jakarta.apache.org/velocity/), the simplest way I \nfound, was to have this hardcoded action linked to a Velocity variable \n&quot;$actionTarget&quot;.\n=&gt;\nBefore clicking the &quot;Save&quot; button with httpUnit, I would just change, \nthrough Velocity, the value of $actionTarget to &quot;SaveServlet&quot;.\n\nThough not the real thing, it was good enough for repetitive unit \ntesting, as we had one &quot;non-automated&quot; test (read : &quot;manual&quot;) test, that \nwould have trapped typos related error.\n\n\nUsing this trick, I could extensively test my javascript enabled \nweb-app. with pure and simple httpUnit.\n\nIt was good enough for enough for us.\nCould be for you.\n\nAlain Ravet\n\n\n",
