Our goal is to\neliminate such tests, but exposure of those tests is required to\nachieve this goal.\n\nThe following (especially the cons since I&#39;m biased and there&#39;s lots\nabout JUnit I don&#39;t yet understand) will likely be missing items but\nI&#39;ll try to be fair about them. If there&#39;s anything missing, I&#39;m sure\npeople will jump in.\n\nPro&#39;s:\n* Simpler code. @Ignore processing would simply be just another\nfilter. Existing duplicate code to check for @Ignore annotations will\ndisappear.\n* Conceptually simpler. @Ignore and Filters aren&#39;t two separate things\nwith different hard-coded nuances.\n\nCon&#39;s:\n* Slower performance. Since notifications will have to be made, the\nset of tests to be run can&#39;t be culled down. Such slower performance\nis theoretical and ought to be measured.\n\nPotential alternatives:\n* Have an option (somewhere) that allows notification for filtered tests.\n* Have a fireFiltered() method for notifiers. I think this would still\nrequire changes to AllDefaultPossibilitiesBuilder.runnerForClass()\nsuch that it returns something similar to IgnoredClassRunner for tests\nthat are filtered out.\n\nNoel\n\n",
