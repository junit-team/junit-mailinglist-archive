Th=\r\nere is no way to define an\n&gt; order, because in my experience independent te=\r\nsts are much more valuable\n&gt; than order-dependent tests.\n&gt;\n&gt; Every time I&#39;v=\r\ne had order dependencies I have had a problem with the design\n&gt; of the unde=\r\nrlying system. Investing my available time in improving the\n&gt; design has ha=\r\nd a much higher payoff than investing that same time into\n&gt; shuffling tests=\r\n around.\n&gt;\n\nI found that if the testing framework takes care of removing ce=\r\nrtain\npractical obstacles, dependent testing is actually very easy to imple=\r\nment\nand to use.  For example, if method c() depends on b() and a() and you=\r\n only\nwant to run c(), you should be able to say &quot;run c()&quot; and the framewor=\r\nk will\nfigure out which dependencies need to be run.\n\nMy experience with Te=\r\nstNG showed me that the fears often associated with\ntest dependencies are v=\r\nery overstated, and dependent testing is actually\nextremely useful for a lo=\r\nt of scenarios such as web testing (where\nnavigating from page to page adds=\r\n state at each step, and having to recreate\nthat state from scratch would b=\r\ne very expensive).  Users of Selenium +\nTestNG with dependencies can probab=\r\nly make a good case at giving you more\ndetails on this.\n\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Independent =\r\ntests enable interesting transformations like parallel\n&gt; execution or the k=\r\nind of dynamic reordering that let JUnit Max deliver\n&gt; failures more quickl=\r\ny.\n&gt;\n\nDependencies and parallelism are actually not mutually exclusive at a=\r\nll.\n Here are a couple of articles I wrote that describe the multithreaded\n=\r\ntopological sort algorithm that I implemented in TestNG:\n\nhttp://beust.com/=\r\nweblog/archives/000535.html\nhttp://beust.com/weblog/archives/000536.html\n\nT=\r\nhis should be especially of interest to developers interested in hard\nconcu=\r\nrrency issues, but all this complexity is completely hidden away from\nusers=\r\n.\n\nWith TestNG, you specify your dependencies (e.g. &quot;@Test(dependsOnMethods=\r\n =3D\n&quot;f&quot;)), then your thread pool size (thread-pool-size=3D15) and TestNG w=\r\nill\nfigure out how to run all your tests (both dependent and non dependent =\r\nones)\nin the most efficient parallel manner by using the threads you suppli=\r\ned as\nwell as possible.\n\n-- \n***C=E9dric\n*\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this mes=\r\nsage have been removed]\n\n\n",
