But I am trying to see if there is a way for the standard \nJUnit TestRunner to display the trace message in the pane where it \nshows us the assertion failures.\n\nVern\n\n--- In junit@y..., &quot;Ted Velkoff&quot; &lt;tvelkoff@c...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Regarding Question 1, I&#39;ve had great results using Log4J.  \nhttp://jakarta.apache.org/log4j/docs/index.html\n&gt; \n&gt; -- Ted Velkoff\n&gt;   ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt;   From: vrntech \n&gt;   To: junit@y... \n&gt;   Sent: Friday, September 27, 2002 9:55 PM\n&gt;   Subject: [junit] Reporting,trace messages, etc\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   Hello Netters,\n&gt; \n&gt;        I am starting to use JUnit and am relatively new to it. \nAfter \n&gt;   searching thru documentation, this news group and other sources, \nsome \n&gt;   issues still remain that I hope some of you can help answer.\n&gt; \n&gt;       1. We have a need to put some trace messages in the tests so \nas \n&gt;   to know the progress of the test itself because each test can be \n&gt;   fairly timeconsuming. Is there a way to have these capture this \n&gt;   output for an individual test in the GUI-based TestRunner? I see \nonly \n&gt;   thing that is captured for each test on the UI are the assertion \n&gt;   failures. \n&gt; \n&gt;       2. I see that JUnitReport is used quite extensively with Ant. \n&gt;   From what I learnt reading, it helps output TestResult in XML \nformat \n&gt;   and then one can translate it using XSLT. Know how one can use \nthat \n&gt;   without having to use Ant? Any resources on Net would be helpful.\n&gt; \n&gt;      3. I see JUnit is great for nesting sub-suites within a suite \nand \n&gt;   thereby creating a tree of suites. But when it comes to test \nresults, \n&gt;   is there a way to get a breakup of which sub-suite had how many \n&gt;   failures from TestResult?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   Thanks in advance,\n&gt;   Vern\n&gt; \n&gt;      \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt;   junit-unsubscribe@y...\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   Your use of Yahoo!
