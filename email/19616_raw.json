Are the test classes \n&gt; annotated =\r\nto run with the parameterized runner?\n\nYes, they are annotated as follows:\n=\r\n@RunWith(Parameterized.class)\n\nAs far as I know in JUnit 3 you could custom=\r\nize what to display in \nthe JUnit view of Eclipse by overriding the getName=\r\n() method of the \nTestCase. Is there any similar solution for that in JUnit=\r\n 4?\n\n&gt;&gt;  2.) Is there a way to display the Standard Output/Error \n&gt;&gt;  separ=\r\nately per each test run?\n&gt; \n&gt; Can you explain a bit more about why you woul=\r\nd want that?\n&gt; \n&gt; Cheers,\n&gt; \n&gt; James\n\nWhen you run more then one JUnit test=\r\n cases (or a parameterized test) \nfrom Eclipse, by default you get only one=\r\n Console view where all \nthe Standard Output/Error messages of all the exec=\r\nuted tests are \ndisplayed in bulk.\nI mean you cannot determine which messag=\r\ne was output by which test \ncase.\n\nThe problem is the same even if you exec=\r\nute your JUnit tests from Ant \nand generate a report. In the report you wil=\r\nl have only \nthe &quot;System.out&quot; and one &quot;System.err&quot; links for the entire tes=\r\nt run \nand not one per each test case.\n\nHowever, I would be interested in a=\r\n solution that captures \nthe &quot;System.out&quot; of my &quot;testMethod[1]&quot; separately =\r\nfrom \nthe &quot;System.out&quot; of my &quot;testMethod[2]&quot;.\n\nBest regards,\nTibor\n\n\n\n",
