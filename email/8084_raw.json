Some people create mocks by\nsubclassing.  I disagree with that approach as it leaves to open to\nundesired &quot;real&quot; behaviour leaking into the mock.  My approach is to\nuse (first extracting as required) an interface for the behaviour to\nbe mocked.  Then the mock is completely standalone.  This was\noriginally a requirement for EasyMock, but I understand that\nrecent/upcoming versions  don&#39;t have that requirement.\n\nThis is also a major benefit of using a Mock.  Not only does it let\nyou verify that the code under test is using the mocked object as\nexpected/required, but it replaces the real object (e.g. network,\ndatabase, etc.) lettin you isolate the code that the test is concerned\nwith.\n\nDave\n\n\n",
