I was trying to be funny, and it looks like I failed.<br/>\n <br/>\nTo answer your specific question, there have been times in my career<br/>\nwhere it hasn&#39;t been commercially desirable to improve design.  Usually,<br/>\nimproving design takes some amount of time and effort.  Sometimes, the<br/>\ncosts of that improvement exceed the value of the improved design.  In<br/>\nthose cases, we&#39;ve made the right business decision to NOT improve the<br/>\nproduct&#39;s design.<br/>\n <br/>\nTo tie this back to JUnit, having a good test suite always decreases the<br/>\ncost of improving design.<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\nTodd.<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________<br/>\n<br/>\n\tFrom: Soaring Eagle [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:comfortable.numb@...\">comfortable.numb@...</a>] <br/>\n\tSent: Tuesday, February 15, 2005 12:02 PM<br/>\n\tTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit@yahoogroups.com\">junit@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n\tSubject: Re: [junit] Testing certain types of methods<br/>\n\t<br/>\n\t<br/>\n\tTodd,<br/>\n\t<br/>\n\tI dont see the &quot;bad&quot; connotation in the text of my email.<br/>\nAnyways -<br/>\n\there is the question repeated.<br/>\n\t<br/>\n\tDo you mean that sometimes it is not commercially desirable to<br/>\n\timprovde design and at such times, JUnit&#39;s inability to be<br/>\nflexible is<br/>\n\ta limitation?<br/>\n\t<br/>\n\tGroup,<br/>\n\t<br/>\n\tI guess I understand what this thread means, but if anyone wants<br/>\nto<br/>\n\tconfirm it, that will be good too.<br/>\n\t<br/>\n\t<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>",
