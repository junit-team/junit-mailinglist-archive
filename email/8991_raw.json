I guess I got involved in the\ndiscussion, I thought it was (at times) useful. Since it was my first\nposting (and heck, I was throttled by moderation) how was I to know that you\ndidn&#39;t want discuss on the list.\n\n\t&gt; I&#39;d suggest some folks should think more between posts or take a\ndiscussion offline until things are resolved,\n\t&gt; then come back with a summary.  But this is so unusual for this list\n(thinking over the past few years),\n\t&gt; it will probably return to normal soon by themselves.\n\nI&#39;d like to think I&#39;ve been thinking, but hmm ... let me think about that\nsome more ... Yup, I&#39;m pretty sure I was. You judge so harshly yet you admit\nyou deleted much of what was there. Couldn&#39;t you have just kept on deleting\nand kept this to yourself? No, I guess you want a quiet mailing list. Ok,\nyou win -- I&#39;m done.\n\nEvery other OSS list I know says discuss here, not in private, the\ndiscussion is part of the process & best archived for reference. Clearly the\nmain two noise producers failed to come to a summary, so observation by\nother was needed. A bunch of folks jumped in with what I considered\ninteresting perspectives, I was grateful for that, even if to you viewed it\nas more noise.\n\n&gt;\t+1\n\n-1 -- but hey, I clearly don&#39;t fit here. I thought I was discussing\nsomething of small potential with the development team of junit, but I\nclearly got that all wrong. I guess from that mistaken hypothesis all\nconclusion is obviously worthless, so I should&#39;ve just given up when I\nthought about giving up.\n\nI learned a lot from these threads, just little of it was about junit & most\nof it was about this list&#39;s participants.\n\nNo more noise from me...\n\nregards\n\nAdam\n\n\n\n\n",
