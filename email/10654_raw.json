When we \nchoose the next test to write, we ought to do so /with a reason/. It&#39;s a \nlittle like playing chess: the ones who play it well play with a plan, \nand the ones who don&#39;t plan tend to lose. Where do we gain insight into \ngood, systematic ways of choosing tests? We can read books like Software \nTesting Lessons Learned or we can spend time with a skilled QA person.\n\nIf we choose the next test with a reason, then when we practise TDD, we \n/will/ consider all the cases, even without DBC to force us to do so.\n\nIf we choose the next test with a reason, then when we practise TDD, we \n/will/ choose the appropriate set of specific tests for the generalized \ncontract statement.\n\nTrue, we won&#39;t be generating those tests from some other form, but \n/that&#39;s just an implementation detail/! So we needn&#39;t go nuts with the \nargument of TDD v. DBC. They are too different ways to do the same \nthing. When writing contracts a la DBC becomes as easy as writing JUnit \ntests, then I&#39;m certainly willing to give it a try. Certainly we could \nmix the two approaches, writing contracts when it&#39;s easy to do so \n(because they can be more powerful and expressive) and writing JUnit \ntests the rest of the time.\n-- \nJ.
