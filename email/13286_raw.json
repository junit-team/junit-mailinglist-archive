I don&#39;t think that this would work. We need\n&gt; both strategies I think, even if one solution seems to be redundant.\n\nWhen I have used &quot;one dataset for all tests&quot;, it has made incremental \ndesign difficult. The primary problem is relationships between entities \nin the data set. I might have to add a few Contracts to test the next \nfeature, but then I need a new Agent or Department or something, and \nthat affects the expected results in tests related to those entities.\n\nWhen I&#39;ve done it -- three times was enough to learn for good -- the \ncost ended up being higher than expected and rose as the project went \non, which is rarely a good sign.\n\n&gt; To only use real test data has big disadvantages in my opinion:\n&gt; - if data changes (real data does), then tests break\n&gt; - you need much more real data than test data to cover all the\n&gt; boundaries and use cases\n&gt; - if you add real data or remove real data from the dataset, tests\n&gt; might break\n&gt; \n&gt; What do you think about it?\n\nI think real data is good, because real data is often stranger than \nmade-up test data. I think one dataset for all tests is a mistake -- a \nbig mistake.\n-- \nJ. B.
