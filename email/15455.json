I&#39;ll leave aside discussion that you can&#39;t<br/>\n&gt;&gt;always isolate components from the infrastructure because it is a<br/>\n&gt;&gt;separate topic and in fact quite achievable in my opinion.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;  Now, for each isolated unit of code we have an unit test. When<br/>\n&gt;&gt;application size grows complexity of unit tests would grow linearly and<br/>\n&gt;&gt;not exponential and as a result close to 100% test coverage is not any<br/>\n&gt;&gt;more difficult to achieve for large codebase then for a small codebase.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I guess it depends what you mean by &quot;code coverage&quot;.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; If you mean &quot;that segment of code was run by at least one test&quot;, then yes,<br/>\n&gt; it&#39;s not &quot;too hard&quot; (albeit still sometimes too complex to be worth the<br/>\n&gt; trouble).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; If you mean &quot;all possible paths of execution have been tested&quot;, then it&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; clearly impossible because it&#39;s exponential with the number of branches in<br/>\n&gt; your code (see &quot;cyclomatic complexity&quot;).<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>   &quot;all possible paths&quot; coverage referred at <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.bullseye.com/coverage.html#basic_path\">http://www.bullseye.com/coverage.html#basic_path</a> is obviously not only <br/>\n  difficult to cover and but also unpractical to verify.<br/>\n<br/>\n   I would say that &quot;condition&quot; or &quot;branch&quot; coverage variants would <br/>\ngive quite acceptable outcome in most of the cases. This is sort of <br/>\nsimilar to the concept of unit testing where each condition <br/>\nprectically interpreted as an individual unit.<br/>\n   See <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.bullseye.com/coverage.html#basic_condition\">http://www.bullseye.com/coverage.html#basic_condition</a><br/>\n   If I am not mistaken this sort of coverage idea is used in an <br/>\nopposide direction by Agitator tool that Kent Beck somehow involved to.<br/>\n<br/>\n   Not to mention, of course, that method with high degree of <br/>\ncomplexity can be broken into individually testable units... :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n   regards,<br/>\n   Eugene</div>",
