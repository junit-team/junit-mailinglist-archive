I&#39;ve learned a lot during this time, thank you<br/>\nall, guys.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn this post, I&#39;d like to discuss a problem of test naming. <br/>\nI mean not only test naming, but also naming of test classes, <br/>\npackages and methods. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen one starts writing tests for legacy code (or even for new one),<br/>\nthere is a common task - find existing tests for some code (if there are<br/>\nany), and decide, how to name new tests. Sometimes the task is obvious, <br/>\nbut not always. Shall one include the name of the class under test <br/>\ninto the test class name? Shall one include name of the tested method <br/>\ninto testXXX method? Or it depends?<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as I learned, usually we shall test behaviour and design, <br/>\nnot specific classes and methods. This allows us to keep tests <br/>\ntask-oriented and not implementation-oriented.<br/>\nConsidering this, I see the following possible decisions regarding<br/>\ntests organization: <br/>\n<br/>\n1. For Functional tests:<br/>\n    - all tests for a use case (and, possibly, alternative flows) are <br/>\n    placed into a single package with an appropriate name. <br/>\n    - each test scenario is placed into single class with appropriate name.<br/>\n<br/>\n2. For Unit tests:<br/>\n    - test package shall be the same as for the production code, <br/>\n    but it is better to use a different source tree.<br/>\n    - for simple classes (such as value objects) it is OK to name<br/>\n    test classes after the name of the class under test <br/>\n    (like UTestFooBar or FooBarTest). Names of test methods,<br/>\n    in its turn, may include the name of the tested method.<br/>\n    - for complex classes, which require a complex fixture to be set,<br/>\n    test case class shall be named using fixture description. <br/>\n    (The issue was discussed previously on this list).<br/>\n    Test method name in this case shall describe the tested behaviour.<br/>\n<br/>\n3. For Integration Tests:<br/>\n    - I suggest, names of Integration tests must differ from Unit tests.<br/>\n    Usually, integration tests run longer, and consequently, more seldom. <br/>\n    That&#39;s why it is convinient to name them differently. One may name <br/>\n    unit tests using UTest prefix, anf Integration tests using ITest prefix.<br/>\n    - I suggest to put integration tests into the same place where unit <br/>\n    tests live (same source tree).<br/>\n    - The names of test classes/methods should be chosen using the same <br/>\n    criteria as for complex Unit tests (based on behavioural aspects).<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d be very glad to hear any comments on this.<br/>\n<br/>\nSorry for such a long post and thank you for your patience.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith king regards,<br/>\nKIR<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nKirill Maximov aka KIR<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kir@...\">kir@...</a> | <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.maxkir.com/\">http://www.maxkir.com/</a><br/>\nSt.Petersburg, Russia</div>",
