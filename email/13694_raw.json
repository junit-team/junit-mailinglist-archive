The constructor will be called when\nbuilding the \n&gt; &gt; test suite so if you want your tests to be properly isolated, it is \n&gt; &gt; safer to always perform the intialization work in setUp.\n&gt; \n&gt; I understand the difference. It&#39;s just that 90%+ of the time the \n&gt; difference doesn&#39;t matter. Unless you&#39;re doing something weird with \n&gt; static variables inside your constructors or something similar, the \n&gt; tests are still properly isolated when using constructors. setUp is\njust \n&gt; a very weird thing that only matters in some strange corner cases. It \n&gt; consistently confuses new users who would be better served by simply \n&gt; ignoring it until they encounter one of the rare needs for it.\n&gt; \n&gt; -- \n&gt; Elliotte Rusty Harold  elharo@m...\n&gt; XML in a Nutshell 3rd Edition Just Published!\n&gt; http://www.cafeconleche.org/books/xian3/\n&gt; http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0596007647/cafeaulaitA/ref=nosim\n\nThat brings up an interesting question - can test methods in classes\nthat contain static variables really be considered isolated, since one\ntest can accidentally change the static value needed by another test?\n And if you&#39;re going to reinitialize the static variable in the\nsetUp() method every time, then what&#39;s the point in the variable being\nstatic?\n\nAlex\n\n\n\n\n\n",
