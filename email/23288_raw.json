(I&#39;m also coming from a differen=\r\nt language.)\n&gt; \n&gt; What I&#39;m about to describe could potentially be done cont=\r\ninuously, but it is drifting away from Unit testing into Integration/Story =\r\ntesting that I would do e.g. every day, or every week.\n&gt; Say I have a metho=\r\nd that outputs an object of type MyClass.\n&gt; I have a version of this method=\r\n in production, and I know it outputs an acceptable object.\n&gt; When I have a=\r\n release candidate, I would like to calculate the object with the new code =\r\nand compare against the object calculated with the production code, ideally=\r\n according to a user-defined tolerance for floats.\n&gt; \n&gt; Let&#39;s say I have an=\r\n integration test which simply calculates the value and performs some intri=\r\nnsic tests on the output.\n&gt; I would imagine that with some generic, recursi=\r\nve reflection and persistence it would be possible to extend JUnit so that =\r\nI can just add one line to my integration test, so that\n&gt; \n&gt; 1. if the test=\r\n is run in &quot;integration mode&quot;, that line is ignored\n&gt; 2. if the test is run=\r\n in &quot;regression_base mode&quot; against production, it persists the output value=\r\n (expected) somewhere\n&gt; 3. if the test is run in &quot;regression_compare&quot; mode,=\r\n it loads back the expected and automatically and generically compares it a=\r\ngainst the actual that I already have in memory at that point\n&gt; \n&gt; and this=\r\n would work for an arbitrary object of an arbitrary type, without requiring=\r\n the test writer to write anything else. Something like this\n&gt; \n&gt; public cl=\r\nass MyClassTest extends RegressionTest {\n&gt;   @Test\n&gt;   public void myIntegr=\r\nationTest() {\n&gt;     MyClass myOutput =3D Whatever.StoryTest();\n&gt; \n&gt;     // =\r\nThis is a standard assertion, part of the story test.\n&gt;     // It always ge=\r\nts executed.\n&gt;     assertTrue(&quot;A reasonable amount&quot;, output.GetAmount() &lt; 5=\r\n0);\n&gt; \n&gt;     // This does something different depending on what &quot;mode&quot; the =\r\ntest is running in.\n&gt;     // The last argument is the tolerance for float c=\r\nomparisons\n&gt;     assertNoRegression(&quot;Regression-testing myOutput&quot;, myObject=\r\n, 10e-2);\n&gt;   }\n&gt; }\n&gt; \n&gt; Do you think this can be achieved in Java? Perhaps=\r\n something has already been done?\n&gt; \n&gt; Thank you\n&gt;\n\n\n\n",
