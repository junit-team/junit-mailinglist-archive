You may <br/>\nbe using a class variable to serve as the unique ID.  If so, try <br/>\nchanging that to use a class method which asks for a unique id...  Do <br/>\nyou see where I&#39;m going?  E.g.<br/>\n<br/>\n  private static int idSeed = 1000;<br/>\n  public static int uniqueId() {<br/>\n    return ++idSeed;<br/>\n  }<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is a problem with this approach, but it is the same as you face <br/>\nwith your current implementation.  If the idSeed variable is <br/>\nhardcoded (as in the example above), each time you rerun the tests, <br/>\nyou will have had to make sure you removed the results from your last <br/>\ntest run.  Resolving this problem will be left as an exercise to the <br/>\nreader.<br/>\n<br/>\nRegards,<br/>\n<br/>\nManuel Amago.</div>",
