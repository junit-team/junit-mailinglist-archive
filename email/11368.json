Let&#39;s face it; a lot of groups of tests do have<br/>\nknown dependencies between tests such that if test A fails, we know that<br/>\nthe output of tests B, C and D are uninteresting. Yet we end up running<br/>\nB, C and D anyway, and then searching through all the error output for<br/>\nthe failure that we know is the &quot;real&quot; one, ignoring all the others as<br/>\nspurious.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would really like a way to be able to express this dependency<br/>\ninformation to the test framework, so that I can get back the<br/>\ninteresting results with fewer uninteresting results. Can anybody<br/>\nthink of a good way to do this?<br/>\n<br/>\nPerhaps a method that returns an ordered list of sets of test names<br/>\nwould do the trick. The sets would be executed in order, with any<br/>\ntest cases not mentioned in any of the sets added to a last, implicit<br/>\nset, and should a test case fail in any set, the later sets would not<br/>\nbe executed at all, just noted as &quot;not executed due to dependency<br/>\nfailures.&quot; Perhaps:<br/>\n<br/>\n    class BaseTestCase {<br/>\n\tpublic String[][] dependencies() {<br/>\n\t    return [];<br/>\n\t}<br/>\n    }<br/>\n<br/>\n    class MyTest extends BaseTestCase {<br/>\n\tpublic String[] dependencies() {<br/>\n\t    return [<br/>\n\t\t[ &quot;testEverythingDependsOnMe&quot; ],<br/>\n\t\t[ &quot;testOne&quot;, &quot;testTwo&quot;, &quot;testThree&quot; ],<br/>\n\t\t[ &quot;testFour&quot; ]<br/>\n\t    ];<br/>\n\t}<br/>\n\t...<br/>\n    }<br/>\n<br/>\nThus, if testTwo breaks; testOne and testThree would still be run, but<br/>\ntestFour would not, since the developer has indicated that he&#39;s not<br/>\ninterested in the result in that case.<br/>\n<br/>\ncjs<br/>\n-- <br/>\nCurt Sampson  &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:cjs@...\">cjs@...</a>&gt;   +81 90 7737 2974   <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.NetBSD.org\">http://www.NetBSD.org</a><br/>\n    Don&#39;t you know, in this new Dark Age, we&#39;re all light.  --XTC</div>",
