If so,\n&gt;where....\nHi,\n\nit&#39;s just a request.setAttribute() or session.setAttribute or \napplication.setAttribute() that is used to store a bean in the \nrequest/session/application scope. The JSP spec is not obvious about this \nfact, but I think it&#39;s just a lack of clarity : if you read between  the \nlines of the spec, you should see the light ;)\n\nJust look at the servlet generated (.java) from your JSP with a useBean tag \nand you will see how simple really it is.\n\nmathieu\n\n&gt;From: David Corbin &lt;dcorbin@...&gt;\n&gt;Reply-To: junit@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;To: junit@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;Subject: Re: [junit] Unit Testing JSPs with Beans\n&gt;Date: Mon, 26 Mar 2001 13:13:03 -0500\n&gt;\n&gt;Is the spec for how beans are stored in the session &quot;published&quot;?

I&#39;m growing a\n&gt; &gt; &gt;framework for testing JSPs by just calling them locally.  But, how do\n&gt; &gt; &gt;you get the JSP-compiled code to use the right (mock) class?  The only\n&gt; &gt; &gt;way I can see, is to completely avoid the &lt;usebean&gt; functionality, and\n&gt; &gt; &gt;roll your own equivalent code which is &quot;mock-aware&quot;.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Why not just have your test code put the right mock object in the \n&gt;session\n&gt; &gt; (or request) objects? Usebean is no magic, is just does a getAttribute. \n&gt;I\n&gt; &gt; guess you are talking about beans that get instantiated (with \n&gt;parameters) by\n&gt; &gt; the JSP itself, in which case a trick would be to have your mock have \n&gt;the\n&gt; &gt; same classname (hello confusion!) and be put before the real objects in \n&gt;your\n&gt; &gt; classpath during unit testing.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; mathieu\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n",
