(I&#39;m sure someone has.)   What I<br/>\n&gt; what to do is generate a report that shows some stats on how many classes<br/>\n&gt; have test cases and how many methods in the class under test have<br/>\n&gt; corresponding test methods.  I have tried it a few different ways:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 1. Just scanning through the source folder, picking up the java files and<br/>\n&gt; then checking if a ?Test.java file exists in a corresponding unit test<br/>\n&gt; folder.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; This approach works well if I only cared about the file coverage, but I now<br/>\n&gt; want info on the method coverage.  Enter method 2.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 2. Use a tool that will parse through the java source and tell me all the<br/>\n&gt; methods. I used javadoc for this, but the problem with it is that I can only<br/>\n&gt; sort through one source structure at a time, and javadoc is not so nice to<br/>\n&gt; call programmatically (it shuts down your app after it runs once).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; If anyone has suggestions on a better was to get info on the methods in a<br/>\n&gt; class, and other information like is the class an interface, I would love to<br/>\n&gt; hear it.  Or better yet, if anyone has seen or built a tool similar to what<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m doing I would also love to hear about it.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thanks,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; John<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\">junit-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
