Instance data <br/>\n&gt; can be initialized in the constructor because JUnit creates a new, clean <br/>\n&gt; object for each test.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Using setUp() is intention-revealing and reduces duplication in the tests.<br/>\n<br/>\nUsing the constructor to set up the fixture :<br/>\n<br/>\na) relies on the implementation detail that a new object is created for <br/>\neach test (I got bitten by this in the switch from NUnit1.0 to NUnit2.0).<br/>\n<br/>\nb) if the set up is expensive it makes the startup sequence of JUnit <br/>\nlong. The &#39;perceived &#39; performance is better if the expense is <br/>\ndistributed across the tests rather than taken up front.<br/>\n<br/>\nc) can introduce weird bugs if the constructor initializes statics.<br/>\n<br/>\nKevin</div>",
