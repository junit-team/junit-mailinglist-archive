With this class, that behavior is that anything<br/>\nsaved with saveLicense() can be loaded with loadLicense(...).  So that<br/>\nmakes good sense (to me) as a single test.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you had some kind of requirement that things written with<br/>\nsaveLicense have a particular format, or that loadLicense expects a<br/>\nparticular format (for 3rd party integration or something), then you&#39;d<br/>\nhave more behaviors and probably want to make separate tests.  Even in<br/>\nthat case, though, testing that stuff saved with saveLicense can be<br/>\nloaded with loadLicense isn&#39;t a bad thing to do.<br/>\n<br/>\n$.02<br/>\n<br/>\nKevin<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Given that I have two methods of my class I need to test, SaveLicense<br/>\n&gt; and LoadLicense, should I write this as two separate tests or as a <br/>\n&gt; single test that incorporates both? To clarify, to load a license, I <br/>\n&gt; would need to have a saved license. The load license would then<br/>\n </span></blockquote>verify <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; that the information that was saved was loaded correctly.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>__________________________________<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nThe New Yahoo!
