The response that preceded that one didn&#39;t g=\r\net posted. The missing post contained the following:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Nice! Thanks Bil=\r\nl for coming up with the idea of a custom suite runner, and thanks David fo=\r\nr writing such a runner! There were a couple of minor snags with your attem=\r\npt below, but with some minor tweaks, it seems to be working nicely.\n&gt;\n&gt; 1.=\r\n [compile time issue] The @RunWith needs to fully qualify OnceOnlySuite (i.=\r\ne., prefix it with &#39;All.&#39;) I decided to just make it a public top-level cla=\r\nss since its use will not be tied to a particular suite.\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Have you test=\r\ned it as written? =A0There should only ever be one of the\n&gt;&gt; internal Runne=\r\nrBuilders constructed, if my brain&#39;s on right, so it\n&gt;&gt; should work. =A0If =\r\nit doesn&#39;t, please let me know so I can adjust my\n&gt;&gt; brain.\n&gt;\n&gt; I tested it=\r\n as written in that the Set was an instance field of the RunnerBuilder, and=\r\n it didn&#39;t work because multiple RunnerBuilders are instantiated. That&#39;s be=\r\ncause multiple OnceOnlySuite runners instantiated. In my example, I annotat=\r\ned A and B to each run with OnceOnlySuite. I did not annotate &#39;All&#39; to use =\r\nOnceOnlySuite because in my real-world scenario, the All suite does have te=\r\nsts that we want to run multiple times (against different targets).\n\nAhh.  =\r\nThat explains it.  Glad it worked--share and enjoy!\n\n   David Saff\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo! Groups Links\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n",
