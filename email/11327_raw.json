I didn&#39;t\nhave all of the required libraries. 1st off I thought the\njmock-cglibxx.jar available on the jmock website was enough to enable\nclass mocking. I went back and re-read the docs and realized that this\nJar only contained the interfaces for cglib mock objects. I then found\ndownloaded CGLIB as directed by the docs on the jmock site and tried\nagain. Still I was getting NoClassDefFound errors pointing to the\norg.objectweb.asm package. I immediately overreacted because we\nrecently switched from the objectweb JOnAS appserver to JBoss and I\nassumed that the error meant that there was stray references to\nobjectweb stuff somewhere in our codebase. I started complaining to\nthe developers here that we need to do a better job of reducing these\nhidden dependencies when I then realized that the error was\ncomplaining about yet another required jar for class mocking. I had to\ngo and download the ASM jar to complete the task. After doing all of\nthis I updated my paths in Idea and re-ran my test to discover that\nthe class I was trying to mock was final and could not be subclassed.\nWhat a poop on my dreams. Anyhow I just wanted to share my experience.\nRule of thumb, if you find the need to mock a class, rethink your\ndesign. I know my design stinks, which is why I&#39;m having so many problems.\n\n\n\n",
