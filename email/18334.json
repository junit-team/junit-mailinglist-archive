I have not tried<br/>\n&gt; &gt; running from command line, nor from within Eclipse, which obviously<br/>\n&gt; &gt; implies not running from a debugger. I am not sure how I would do that<br/>\n&gt; &gt; in Eclipse, to tell you the truth. I have never done this, but see my<br/>\n&gt; &gt; junit recipes book discusses running tests from within eclipse. I&#39;ll<br/>\n&gt; &gt; give that a try later today.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; How&#39;d that go?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n </span></blockquote>Haven&#39;t tried, yet. Still really busy cleaning up after one migration<br/>\nwhile trying to complete another migration. Ow! I thought I&#39;d have<br/>\ntime yesterday, but... Anyway, I&#39;ll probably give it a shot over the<br/>\nweekend.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I did comment out the various AllTests and found the offender. That<br/>\n&gt; &gt; AllTest only executed one test. So, I added a target for the one<br/>\n&gt; &gt; offending test class. When running that, the response is the same as<br/>\n&gt; &gt; below. It appears to be not running the test at all.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n </span></blockquote>In the heat of things yesterday, I did trigger my AllTest that had the<br/>\noffending sub AllClass&#39;s commented out. This had worked in the past<br/>\nbut it seems it did not yesterday. However, I cannot be sure. Testing<br/>\nwasn&#39;t critical at the moment (I had meant to call a different target<br/>\nto jar and deploy), so I didn&#39;t research. Possibly I was mistaken<br/>\nabout the state of the test.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; Can you share anything about the test class that is causing the pain?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n </span></blockquote>Assuming I am correct in identifying the failing class, no, there is<br/>\nnothing really significant about the class. I have one test. It<br/>\nreturns an int. I assert that the value returned is what is expected.<br/>\nThe underlying class, likewise, is nothing very special. Testing via<br/>\nother means demonstrates that it works just fine.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe problem has to be something simple, something obvious, I am<br/>\noverlooking. Hmmmm... Unfortunately, there are no other eyes I can<br/>\nshare with. I am the only geek here nor have I really developed<br/>\nfriendships with others in the java/junit community locally with whom<br/>\nI would feel comfortable sitting down with and working through it. I<br/>\nguess that is what happens when one is independent and does not live<br/>\nin Silicon Valley ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; Good luck,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;    David Saff<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>",
