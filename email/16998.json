I needed<br/>\n&gt; to write some tests around a user belonging to a group.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I needed at a minimum an implementation of IDfUser and IDfGroup. Due to the<br/>\n&gt; nature of the beast it is most common to get these from the session<br/>\n&gt; (IDfSession). As all of these are interfaces it wasn&#39;t too bad but each of<br/>\n&gt; the interfaces extends others and have several hundred methods each. I<br/>\n&gt; eventually decided that what I was trying to test in this case was<br/>\n&gt; Documentum logic and that I should just trust the framework.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Another example is Documentum web components which are similiar in some ways<br/>\n&gt; to JSF. These extend standard Documentum classes which provide a large<br/>\n&gt; amount of functionality much of which eventually ties back to a functionaing<br/>\n&gt; sql database via a custom interface and/or query language. In these cases<br/>\n&gt; the best I could do was to test extracted business logic piecemeal.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;m having difficulty seeing how these statements relate to &quot;various <br/>\nmocking libraries&quot; having &quot;too many moving parts to be useful for more <br/>\nthan trivial tests&quot;. It seems the problem lies in the Documentum API and <br/>\nnot in mocking libraries. What am I missing?<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJ. B.
