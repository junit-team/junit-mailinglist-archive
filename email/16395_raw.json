The\n=\r\nJUnit site maintains a lot of useful information and links to other\nresourc=\r\nes. Many of the articles there are directed towards the\nbeginner and will h=\r\nelp you greatly as you learn about JUnit. Google is\nuseful when there&#39;s som=\r\nething you need, but don&#39;t know what it is.\nJust type a description in, pre=\r\nss enter and see how much help it can\nbe. I&#39;ve found quite a few useful thi=\r\nngs that way. Another tip with\nGoogle is to search on the specific error me=\r\nssage that you have, often\nyou&#39;ll find forum discussions about that exact e=\r\nrror, with a good\nchance of a solution being given as well.\n\nAs you learn a=\r\nnd start having questions, you will also find the JUnit\nFAQ very helpful. T=\r\nhe questions that it answers really are the\nfrequent ones that most of us h=\r\nad asked or wondered about and Mike\nClark does a wonderful job of collating=\r\n it. Here is a link:\n\nhttp://junit.sourceforge.net/doc/faq/faq.htm\n\nWhen yo=\r\nu are ready to start asking more questions on the JUnit mailing\nlist, pleas=\r\ne consider following all of the advice in Eric Raymond&#39;s\nvery helpful docum=\r\nent: &quot;How to ask questions the smart way&quot;, available\nat his website. Here i=\r\ns a link:\n\nhttp://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html\n\nAs far as bo=\r\noks are concerned, I recommend Pragmatic Unit Testing by\nHunt and Thomas fo=\r\nr beginners. JUnit recipes by Rainsberger is good\nonce you&#39;re past the basi=\r\ncs. There are other good books out there, but\nthese are my recommendations.=\r\n\n\nI hope that this helps.\n\nSimon\n\n--\nwww.simonpeter.org\n\n",
