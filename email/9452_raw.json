Comments are not executable and cannot\n&gt; &gt; fail if\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt;  &gt; they are wrong, so they are waste.\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; So code should never be commented??  This makes no sense.\n\nTelling people that code should not be commented, that comments are\nwaste, remains extremely bad advice.\n\n&gt; &gt; *  fewer comments correlate well with more bugs\n&gt;\n&gt; Fewer comments are generally not the cause, though: fewer comments\n\n&#39;Correlates with&#39; does not mean &#39;causes&#39;.\n\n&gt; &gt; *  as often as not, it&#39;s faster to rewrite uncommented code than it is\n&gt; &gt;    to figure out what the code &quot;already says&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; If the code is doing anything complex, if it is implementing rules\n&gt; &gt; that contain domain-specific knowledge, comments are not waste --\n&gt; &gt; they are absolutely essential.\n&gt;\n&gt; Not essential, although they can help. If the code simply said what the\n&gt; comments say, then they *would* be both the comments and the logic. It&#39;s\n&gt; simply a matter of choosing better names and extracting methods where\n&gt; appropriate.\n\nI really don&#39;t want to drag this out any further - but this makes no\nsense at all.\n\nIn the real world, in most cases you can&#39;t explain your logic simply\nby choosing better variable names.  In most cases, you have to spell\nout why you are doing what you are doing.  Otherwise, whatever poor soul\ncomes along a year or two later to fix your code is going to be lost.\n\n&gt; I&#39;m not saying that I don&#39;t know how to write printf() or use the\n&gt; debugger. I just choose not to when I can write tests instead. It&#39;s\n&gt; clear to me that tests provide the same benefits as printf() *and*\n&gt; preserve what I have learn for posterity. &quot;It&#39;s no good to anyone else\n&gt; in your head, Mozart. Write it down.&quot; (paraphrase of Salieri from the\n&gt; film Amadeus.)\n\nTake your own advice.  Don&#39;t keep it in your head.  Comment your code.\n\n--\nJim Dixon  jdd@...   tel +44 117 982 0786  mobile +44 797 373 7881\n\n\n",
