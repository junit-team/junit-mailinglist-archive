The good think is\nthat you&#39;re showing the way to go.  The developers will have someting to\nwork on immediately.\n\n   &gt; 2. As for JTest, it will do even something else for you, which is to\n   &gt; come up (through reflection\n   &gt; and some other techniques) with a basic set of unit tests that can be\n   &gt; manually augmented later\n\n\nI always have problem with tools that generate &quot;tests&quot; for your code.\nBut as I don&#39;t know JTest, take my comment as general.\n\nWriting tests is verifying what the class _must_ do and not what the\nclass _is_ doing.  Because the tool has normally no way of guessing what\nthe class must do, it tests its actual behaviour.  To my opinion, these\n&quot;tests&quot; do not help you to find bugs (in general), but can be seen as a\n&quot;safety net&quot; (because once generated, they should all pass).  If one of\nthese tests failes after adding a feature, it tells you that you changed\nthe behaviour of your application.  It&#39;s up to you then to review the\n&quot;test&quot; and see if it&#39;s still accurate.  But maybe JTest acts differently.\n\n-Vladimir\n\n-- \nVladimir Bossicard\nwww.bossicard.com\n\n\n\n\n\n",
