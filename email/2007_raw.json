So IMHO,\n&gt; testNeedImplement() seems to fit better.\n\na matter of taste.  It&#39;s an old discussion (see archive)\n\n&gt; Second, a REAL post-it or a note at the back of your task card seem to work a\n&gt; lot more effectively.\n\nnot if you work in a team sharing the same code, the same test code...  The other members of the team must know what is to be done (in general)\n\n&gt; Actually, I applaud for the other post about the Calendar assertion.\n&gt; That seems to be something novel.  :)\n\nI agree.  But if you write code (1) to remind you to write code (2), what happens if you make a mistake writing the code (1) (error in the date...).\n\nAfter reflection, I prefer a simple &quot;vbo_todo:&quot; (vbo is my standard visa) and parse the project to be sure that I haven&#39;t forgotten any todo.\n\nSome folks will introduce a new javadoc tag and so on, but it&#39;s another topic :-)\n\n-Vladimir\n\n\n\n",
