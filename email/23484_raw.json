One thing I didn&#39;t implement =\r\nwas a\nnotion of skipped tests, but I&#39;m considering adding that, because it =\r\nmeans\nsomething different than ignored or pending tests. What these mean in=\r\n\nScalaTest are:\n\nignored: test used to work, but I broke it and don&#39;t have =\r\ntime to fix it\nnow. Don&#39;t want to delete it, so marking it ignored and have=\r\n a good\nintention of coming back and fixing it later\n\npending: fleshing out=\r\n the &quot;specification&quot; of code I likely haven&#39;t written\nyet, but for sure the=\r\n test I haven&#39;t written yet (pendingUntilFixed is a\nsubset of this, for a b=\r\nug I haven&#39;t fixed yet.)\n\nskipped: test skipped due to some assumption need=\r\ned by the test not being\nmet, such as a database being available on the net=\r\nwork.\n\nThe skipped concept shows up in JUnit as assumptions, and in TestNG =\r\nas\ndependent tests, I think.\n\nBill\n\nOn Thu, Jun 23, 2011 at 1:07 AM, Esko L=\r\nuontola &lt;esko.luontola@...&gt;wrote:\n\n&gt; **\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Joakim Ohlrogge wrote o=\r\nn 23.6.2011 0:20:\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Jumi looks very interesting.

There are quite m=\r\nany different reasons for having a\n&gt; skipped/ignored/pending test, and also=\r\n with some testing frameworks they\n&gt; are marked pending during the executio=\r\nn of the test (e.g. ScalaTest&#39;s\n&gt; pendingUntilFixed) whereas some mark them=\r\n before executing any test code\n&gt; (e.g. JUnit&#39;s @Ignore).\n&gt;\n&gt; At first I&#39;ll=\r\n create the simplest possible solution and have just one\n&gt; concept of skipp=\r\ned tests. Later, once I get some feedback from users and\n&gt; framework develo=\r\npers, I&#39;ll gather the different use cases for skipping\n&gt; tests and think ab=\r\nout supporting them better.\n&gt;\n&gt; --\n&gt; Esko Luontola\n&gt; www.orfjackal.net\n&gt;  \n=\r\n&gt;\n\n\n\n-- \nBill Venners\nArtima, Inc.\nhttp://www.artima.com\n\n\n[Non-text portio=\r\nns of this message have been removed]\n\n\n",
