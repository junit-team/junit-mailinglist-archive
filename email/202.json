However, the way that nested transactions work<br/>\ndiffers from db to db and from framework to framework, e.g. some changes to the<br/>\ndata might only be visible once they have been committed by the outermost<br/>\ntransaction. Those subtleties can make it a very difficult task to do it always<br/>\nthe way Kevin describes. This is just one more argument for providing a<br/>\nmockable abstraction to your persistent data layer and to use the mock in as<br/>\nmany tests as possible.<br/>\n<br/>\nJohannes</div>",
